 INTRODUCTION 
 History 
 
1 In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 (' Telstra No 2' ), I considered a Part A competition notice ('the Competition Notice') issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the Commission') pursuant to s 151AKA(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').
Telstra challenged the issue of the Competition Notice and the written notice given by the Commission pursuant to s 151AKA(10) of the Act prior to the issue of the Competition Notice ('the Consultation Notice').
2 In Telstra No 2 I determined that the Consultation Notice and the Competition Notice differed in the kind of anti-competitive conduct described, with those differences being ones of substance (at [263]).
Due to these differences, the Consultation Notice did not comply with s 151AKA(10) of the Act and the Commission was not entitled to issue the Competition Notice (at [266]).
Telstra was not given the opportunity provided by the Act to respond to a s 151AKA(10) notice and to make submissions to the Commission on the conduct the subject of the Competition Notice prior to its issue.
Telstra was, therefore, denied procedural fairness and natural justice under statute and at common law (at [267]).
3 The parties subsequently made submissions on the appropriate orders to give effect to the reasons.
I then indicated to the parties that I wished to hear further from them concerning the application of s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act') in the context of the concession made by the Commission that the decision to issue a Part A competition notice was a reviewable decision under s 5.
The additional point 
 
4 When the matter came before the Court, the Commission stated that, without conceding that leave was required, it wished to make an application for leave to argue an additional point.
This concerned the application of s 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ('the Interpretation Act ') to the Competition Notice.
The Commission accepts that the possible application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act was not addressed before the publication of reasons in Telstra No 2 or considered by the Commission prior to the further hearing on the orders.
5 There is no dispute that all relevant factual matters were before the Court for the determination of Telstra No 2 .
That included the form and content of the Competition Notice and the differences between the anti-competitive conduct there described and the conduct described in summary form in the Consultation Notice.
Two of those differences concerned a class of customers ('Lower Spend Customers') and the bundling of Telstra's services.
6 I permitted the Commission to file a notice of motion seeking leave to rely on s 46 of the Interpretation Act .
The Commission undertook to pay Telstra's costs occasioned by any agitation of the issues based on s 46 on a party and party basis.
As matters transpired, the hearing of the application for leave evolved into submissions that descended into a consideration of the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act to the Competition Notice.
7 Section 46 of the Interpretation Act provides that, unless a contrary intention appears, an instrument made by an authority, that is neither a legislative instrument within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (Cth) ('the Legislative Instruments Act ') nor a rule of court, which is in excess of the authority's power is to be taken to be valid to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.
The provision has a parallel in s 15A of the Interpretation Act and, in relation to legislative instruments, in s 13 of the Legislative Instruments Act .
Section 15A of the Interpretation Act provides that legislation should be read and construed subject to the Constitution and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.
If an Act is in excess of power, it is valid to the extent that it is not in excess of that power.
Section 13 of the Legislative Instruments Act is in similar terms to s 46 of the Interpretation Act .
8 It is not disputed that a Part A competition notice is an instrument to which s 46 of the Interpretation Act applies.
9 The Commission now moves the Court for the following orders:
 
 (a) that the Commission be granted leave to argue that ss 46(1)(c) and 46 (2) of the Interpretation Act apply to the interpretation of the Competition Notice;
 (b) that the application of s 46(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act to the interpretation of the Competition Notice requires that notice to be read so that it is valid and to the extent that it refers to Lower Spend Customers and bundling issues these are to be construed as instances or examples of the kind of anti-competitive conduct summarised in the Consultation Notice; and alternatively
 (c) that the application of s 46(2) of the Interpretation Act to the interpretation of the Competition Notice requires certain words contained within it to be severed from it.

 Issues 
 
10 Four issues fall for determination:
 
 1. whether the Court should exercise its discretion to permit consideration of the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act to the Competition Notice;
 2. the application of s 46(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act to the Competition Notice;
 3. the application of s 46(2) of the Interpretation Act to the Competition Notice; and
 4. the orders to be made.

 DISCRETION 
 
11 The Commission's position on leave fluctuated.
Initially, the Commission seemed to accept that it required leave to argue the additional point.
However, the Commission subsequently abandoned any reliance on discretionary factors and adopted the position that the application of the statutory provision is mandatory.
The Commission submits that the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act is mandatory and that accordingly discretionary factors are not relevant.
In the alternative, the Commission submits that leave to re-open is not of itself required, rather it is leave to argue the additional point.
Regardless, in argument the Commission ultimately accepted that leave is required to put the matter before the Court.
12 The Commission submits that if leave to argue the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act is required, the relevant factors to consider are:
 
 (a) that there is utility in considering the application of s 46 , particularly given that third parties may seek to bring proceedings based on the Competition Notice in its severed form; 
 (b) the Commission's role as the government agency responsible for administering Pt XIB of the Act; and
 (c) the timing of raising the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act including: 
 
 
 i. whether the point could have been raised earlier;
 ii.
the interests of justice; and
 iii.
the finality of litigation.

 

13 The grant of leave depends on the exercise of discretion.
Telstra submits that leave to re-open is required and should be refused.
Telstra says that the Commission failed to raise this issue at the appropriate time.
Further, Telstra submits that any implicit attempt to re-open the issues decided in Telstra No 2 should be rejected.
Does the question of discretion arise?

 
14 The question that arose in Telstra No 2 was whether the Commission was entitled to issue the Competition Notice.
That raised questions as to the construction of the Consultation Notice and of the Competition Notice.
In the face of a challenge to the issue of the Competition Notice, the Commission chose to advance its case on the basis of the validity of its decision to issue the Competition Notice as it stood, in its entirety, on an all or nothing basis.
In those circumstances, the Court was not obliged of its own motion to consider whether the Competition Notice could be saved in part.
15 The Commission says that, as the application of s 46 is something which would have had to have been considered if it had been raised earlier, it should be considered now.
I do not accept that.
The Court does, however, retain a discretion to permit the Commission to change the basis of its case and to rely upon the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act , if applicable, to alter the construction and effect of the Competition Notice.
16 Factors relevant to the exercise of discretion include the interests of the party seeking to have the matter argued, any prejudice to the respondent party, the policy inherent in s 22 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and the public interest in the finality of justice ( Hyster Australia Pty Ltd v Anti-dumping Authority (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 259 at 263).
17 One consideration is whether s 46 applies to "save" the Competition Notice.
General discretionary factors 
 Utility 
 
18 The question of utility arises as the Competition Notice is no longer in force.
The Competition Notice was revoked on 2 March 2007 with effect from 28 February 2007.
Optus has consented to orders dismissing with costs the proceedings it commenced against Telstra in reliance on the Competition Notice.
19 The Commission submits that, notwithstanding that the Competition Notice has been revoked, there is utility and a "useful purpose" in the Court proceeding to construe the Competition Notice according to the requirements in s 46 of the Interpretation Act .
The Commission refers to the key policy objective of a Part A competition notice being to stop anti-competitive conduct quickly and to open the gate for penalties to apply.
The Commission accepts for present purposes the effect of the Competition Notice as set out in [243] to [249] of Telstra No 2 but still submits that the notice continues to have "a limited role".
Although not determinative of whether there has been a breach of the competition rule, the consequences of a Part A competition notice are serious and are intended to cause the recipient to stop the conduct considered by the Commission to be in breach of the competition rule ( Telstra No 2 at [249]).
20 The Commission argues that Part A competition notices open the gate to third party damages actions and this requires that the valid parts of a Part A competition notice be read within power so that third parties are provided with the opportunity to seek damages based on those parts.
Sections 151CC(2) and (3) of the Act provide that an action for loss or damage may be commenced at any time within three years after the date on which the cause of action accrued, provided that the alleged conduct was of a kind dealt within a Part A competition notice that was in force at the time when the alleged conduct occurred.
The Commission argues that although the Optus proceedings have been dismissed, there may be other relevant parties who could commence proceedings based on a reconstrued Competition Notice.
However, the Commission has been unable to point to any such third party.
21 Although I accept that the Act provides the opportunity for a third party to commence proceedings relating to conduct the subject of a Part A competition notice, no such party has been identified.
The proceedings commenced by Optus against Telstra have been dismissed.
No utility in this regard has been demonstrated.
22 The Commission also submits that, from a corporate governance perspective, there is "some" utility in Telstra considering its conduct in accordance with the matters raised in the Competition Notice in its severed form to ensure compliance with the Act.
In these circumstances, the Commission argues, although the Competition Notice was revoked in February 2007, the objective of providing incentives for Telstra to change its conduct requires that the valid parts of the Competition Notice be read to be within power.
This would enable Telstra to consider its conduct in accordance with the matters raised within the Competition Notice and to determine whether to change its conduct.
The application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act to preserve the valid parts of the Competition Notice is therefore said to be consistent with the purpose and objects of the Act as outlined.
23 There is no evidence that Telstra would benefit from this course of action.
Indeed, Telstra was entitled to rely on the revocation of the Competition Notice.
I consider that there is little utility in Telstra further considering its own conduct in relation to a Part A competition notice that has been revoked, even if that notice were now amended or reconstrued.
Telstra does not assert that it wishes to do so for corporate governance reasons or otherwise.
Telstra is certainly aware of the Commission's position and the Act.
24 Any utility in the Court considering the Competition Notice in light of s 46 of the Interpretation Act is limited where the matter was not argued during the hearing but only raised immediately prior to the making of orders.
There is no evidence that Telstra would benefit from an amended Part A competition notice.
Accordingly, I am unable to find any relevant utility in considering the application of s 46 to the Competition Notice.
The Commission as the government agency responsible for administering Pt XIB of the Act 
 
25 As the government agency charged with administering Pt XIB of the Act and taking appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the Act, the Commission submits that there is public interest in the Act being administered correctly.
The Commission submits that on becoming aware of the potential application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act , it was incumbent upon the Commission to put the matter before the Court to enable the Court to arrive at "the proper and just result" in full knowledge of the law.
26 Further, the Commission submits that, as a government agency, the discretionary factors to be applied regarding its position may be approached differently to those of a commercial litigant.
The Commission points to the decision of Jacobson J in Pacific National (ACT) Ltd v Queensland Rail (2005) 215 ALR 544 at 560 where his Honour cited P  C Cantarella v Egg Marketing Board (NSW) [1973] 2 NSWLR 366 at 383 per Mahoney JA:
 
 The duty of the executive branch is to ascertain the law and obey it.
If there is any difficulty in ascertaining what the law is, as applicable to a particular case, it is open to the executive to approach the court, or afford the citizen the opportunity for approaching the court, to clarify the matter.
Where the matter is before the court, it is the duty of the executive to assist the court to arrive at the proper and just result.

 

27 I do not find this principle apposite in the circumstances of an opposed application to re-open the Commission's case in response to Telstra's challenges as outlined in Telstra No 2 .
28 I am not persuaded by these matters.
If the Commission failed to raise a matter on which it could have relied in Telstra No 2 , it is not incumbent on the Court to remedy that course of action.
The role of the Commission in complying with Pt XIB of the Act was the subject of Telstra No 2 .
I do not see that this application will result in further clarification.
I do not accept that questions of discretion relevant to the course of litigation should be applied differently to the Commission or disregarded because the Commission is a government agency.
It may be the duty of the executive to assist the court to arrive at the proper or just result but if it fails to do so in a timely and efficient manner where it is a party to litigation, other discretionary considerations may also apply.
29 This is the first time that a court has considered a Part A competition notice and the provisions of Pt XIB of the Act.
While that may suggest that the Court should grant some indulgence to those arguing about the validity of the notice, it is also the case that the Commission should have been careful of the need to consider all aspects that it wished to bring to the Court's attention.
The timing of raising the application on s 46 of the Interpretation Act 
 
 30 The Commission freely acknowledges the tardiness of its attempt to raise and rely on s 46 of the Interpretation Act .
There is no suggestion that it made a calculated decision not to do so earlier.
It was just not thought of.
There was, however, no reason why the question of the potential application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act could not have been raised during the hearing of Telstra No 2 , even if all of the possible outcomes of the challenges to the Competition Notice and the Consultation Notice could not have been considered until after the reasons were delivered.
It was not raised.
31 The Commission acknowledges that there were no submissions from the Commission, Optus or Telstra on whether, if the Commission was not entitled to issue the Competition Notice, it was only entitled to issue a Part A competition notice that did not go beyond the kind of conduct described in the Consultation Notice.
The Commission acknowledges that there were no submissions on the application of ss 46(1)(c) or 46 (2) of the Interpretation Act .
It submits that ' Telstra should not now be allowed to rely on its own failure (together with that of Optus and the Commission) to fully address the Court on the relevant law relating to these issues... ' and submits that the orders made in the absence of such consideration would potentially be an error of law.
32 It could be said that this represents an example of "the best form of defence is attack".
Telstra's case was that the notice was invalid in its entirety and it succeeded in that attack.
It was for the Commission to raise any question of partial validity and it failed to do so.
The interests of justice 
 
33 The Commission submits that the interests of justice support an exercise of the Court's discretion to allow the Commission to argue the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act , in circumstances where the Court would otherwise proceed according to a misapprehension of the relevant law.
34 Where the Commission has provided an undertaking to pay Telstra's costs occasioned by the agitation of the new issue on a party and party basis, the Commission submits that Telstra's interests have been adequately protected.
It says that the interests of justice require that the Court proceed to consider the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act to the Competition Notice.
35 Telstra disputes that its interests are adequately protected by the costs undertaking.
Telstra points to the fact that Part A competition notices are prospective and that the effect of a revised Competition Notice would be to issue a notice to Telstra with retrospective effect.
36 It is not in the interests of justice to re-open the case in circumstances where Telstra has not had the opportunity to modify its conduct in relation to the revised Competition Notice and where it could not address this issue during the hearing.
The finality of litigation 
 
37 The Commission submits that the parties and the Court clearly intended that the proceeding was not finalised before orders were made.
The Commission argues that the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act is still a matter which is ' directly relevant to identifying the appropriate orders in the circumstances ' and that in the circumstances it is ' appropriate and fair ' to allow it to argue the application of s 46 of the Interpretation Act .
The Commission argues that the principles of finality of litigation are not relevant.
Rather, the Commission says, this is a new point not argued at the hearing.
38 The Commission's submission ignores the fact that a decision on the Competition Notice has issued, the Competition Notice has been revoked, it would have expired in any event and third party proceedings based on the Competition Notice have, by consent, been dismissed.
So far as Telstra is concerned, the matter was finalised.
Conclusion on discretion 
 
39 I do not consider that the Commission has raised any sufficient general factors for the exercise of the discretion to permit the new issue to be raised.
40 While I accept that the Commission has an interest in maintaining the validity of the Competition Notice, there is uncertainty and prejudice to Telstra as a consequence.
In circumstances where the Competition Notice has been revoked, reasons concerning its invalidity published, and third party proceedings based on its existence dismissed, it is hard to see any general interest in its revival.
There is, on the other hand, a benefit in finality of litigation.
The Commission raised this matter before final orders were made only when I recalled the parties to clarify a concession that had been made by the Commission on an unrelated matter.
The only explanation for the timing was that the Commission and its legal advisers had not thought of the point earlier.
41 In those circumstances as a matter of general discretion I would decline to permit further argument as to the validity of the Competition Notice.
42 However, the terms of s 46 of the Interpretation Act and the likelihood of its application to the Competition Notice are also relevant to the discretion.
There is an overarching obligation to ensure that the Court does not otherwise proceed according to a misapprehension of the relevant law.
I will therefore consider the application of this section.
SECTION 46 OF THE INTERPRETATION ACT 
 
43 Section 46 of the Interpretation Act relevantly provides:
 
 
 (1) If a provision confers on an authority the power to make an instrument that is neither a legislative instrument within the meaning of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 nor a rule of court, then, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) this Act applies to any instrument so made as if it were an Act and as if each provision of the instrument were a section of an Act; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) expressions used in any instrument so made have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) any instrument so made is to be read and construed subject to the enabling legislation, and so as not to exceed the power of the authority.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) If any instrument so made would, but for subsection (1), be construed as being in excess of the authority's power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

 
 
 

44 For s 46 of the Interpretation Act to apply, the following requirements must be met:
 
 (a) A provision confers a power.
(b) The power is conferred on an authority.
(c) The power is to make an instrument.
(d) That instrument is not a legislative instrument nor a rule of Court.


45 It is not disputed that the Competition Notice is an instrument to which s 46 applies because:
 
 (a) Section 151AKA(2) of the Act specifies the power to issue a Part A competition notice.
(b) The power is expressly conferred on the Commission, which is a body established by s 6A(1) of the Act and which is a statutory agency under the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth) ( Foxtel Management Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2000) 173 ALR 362 at [135] per Wilcox J).
The Commission is therefore an "authority" for the purposes of s 46 of the Interpretation Act .
(c) The relevant power is the power of the Commission to issue a document, namely the Part A competition notice, which is an "instrument" (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Azevedo v Secretary, Department of Primary Industries and Energy (1992) 35 FCR 284 at 299-300 per French J; Collector of Customs (NSW) v Lawlor (1979) 24 ALR 307 at 313 and 323-324 referred to in Evans v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 945 at [22] per Merkel J).
(d) A Part A competition notice is not a legislative instrument under the Legislative Instruments Act as it is not legislative in character, nor is it a rule of Court.


46 The Commission contends that ss 46(1)(c) and 46 (2) of the Interpretation Act apply to the Competition Notice as issued.
47 The substantive order that the Commission seeks in reliance on s 46(1)(c) is an order that the application of s 46(1) of the Interpretation Act to the interpretation of the Competition Notice requires the Competition Notice to be read so that it is:
 
 ...valid and to the extent that it refers to Lower Spend Customers and bundling issues these are to be construed as instances or examples of the kind of anti-competitive conduct summarised in the [Consultation Notice] (and not a different kind of anti-competitive conduct).

 

48 In the alternative, the Commission proffers an edited Competition Notice by the application of s 46(2) , whereby certain of the content, including reference to Lower Spend Customers, is severed.
The proposed edited Competition Notice is Annexure A to these reasons.
49 The relevant rule of construction applying to primary legislation is that contained with s 15A of the Interpretation Act which provides:
 
 Every Act shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

 

50 If an Act, legislative instrument or an instrument issued by an authority acting within the power of a provision is construed as being in excess of authority, it is to be "read down" or severed to be valid to the extent that it is not within power.
It is read down to bring it within power, providing that the instrument itself contains some test that would permit severance ( Evans v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 276 ; (2003) 135 FCR 306 at [63] per Kenny J).
However, as Kenny J pointed out at [65], it may not be possible if various aspects or requirements that are within and beyond power are interdependent.
