 Background 
 
1 In 2006 a number of retail stores throughout Australia carried on business under business names that included the words 'Betta Electrical', 'Betta', 'Chandlers' or 'Truscotts'.
The majority of those retail stores were franchisees of the relevant business name.
2 The relevant franchisor would appear to have been one or other of the companies in the 'Betta Group,' which comprised Betta Stores Limited ACN 009 710 605 ('Betta Stores'), Betta Stores (Southern) Pty Limited ACN 059 881 220 ('BSS'), Betta Stores (Northern) Pty Limited ACN 112 330 944 ('BSN'), A.K.
Truscott Investments Pty Limited ACN 007 818 493, Truscott Electronics Pty Limited ACN 007 549 206 ('TE'), Truscott Finance Pty Limited ACN 007 598 389, PGA  Associates Pty Limited ACN 007 755 615 and BSL Finance Pty Limited ACN 058 061 822 ('BSLF').
3 The principal banker to the Betta Group would appear to have been Commonwealth Bank of Australia ('the CBA').
4 The several companies in the Betta Group would appear to have given fixed and floating charges to the CBA to secure the payment of monies outstanding from time to time to the CBA.
None of the relevant security documents are presently in evidence.
5 It is common ground that on 5 October 2006 the respondents, Philip Patrick Carter and David Laurence McEvoy, who are partners in the firm of chartered accountants known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, were appointed by the CBA as receivers and managers of Betta Stores, BSS, A. K. Truscott Investments Pty Limited and BSLF.
The respondents were also appointed as receivers and managers of TE, Truscott Finance Pty Limited and PGA  Associates Pty Limited on the same day.
6 On the following day, namely 6 October 2006, the respondents were appointed as receivers and managers of BSN also.
7 The nine applicants, Acer Computer Australia Pty Limited, Audio Products Group Pty Limited, Hagemeyer Brands Australia Pty Limited, Ingram Micro Pty Limited, Panasonic Australia Pty Limited, Pebble Electronics Pty Limited, Think Appliances Pty Limited, Grundig Australia Pty Limited and Fujitsu General (Aust.
) Pty Limited, were all suppliers of goods which were offered for sale in the various retail stores trading under the 'Betta Electrical', 'Betta', 'Chandlers' or 'Truscotts' names.
At the time of the appointment of the respondents as receivers and managers of the various companies in the Betta Group, the holding company was Betta Stores.
8 In 2006 there were about 140 franchisees of one or other of the 'Betta Electrical', 'Betta', 'Chandlers' and 'Truscotts' names.
They conducted their respective businesses through approximately 240 separate retail outlets.
In addition to franchisees, a small number of companies within the Betta Group itself operated retail stores.
These included TE, which operated eight stores in the Adelaide area, BSN, which operated four stores in Queensland, and BSS, which operated eight stores in Victoria and the Northern Territory.
9 By 5 October 2006 BSN had closed down three of its four stores, leaving it with one retail outlet, and BSS had closed down six of its stores, leaving it with two retail outlets.
10 At this stage in the proceedings there is no agreement between the parties as to the terms and conditions on which goods were supplied by the several applicants nor is there agreement as to the identity of the company or companies or individuals which were supplied with the various goods that were offered for sale through the various stores which traded under one or other of the 'Betta Electrical', 'Betta', 'Chandlers' and 'Truscotts' names.
11 Each of the applicants contends that the relevant purchaser was bound by its terms and conditions.
Insofar as the purchaser/s may have been one or other of the companies within the Betta Group there may have been 'terms and conditions of purchase' propounded by Betta Stores and/or BSLF, some or all of which may have formed part of the various agreements for sale of the goods that were supplied.
12 At the heart of the applicants' cases lies the question of whether or not the relevant supplier of goods remained the owner of those goods until such time as payment for them had been effected and whether or not the proceeds of sale of them to third parties were in some way or another impressed with a trust such that the proceeds of sale, or at least part thereof, were held in trust for the supplier and thus not available to the CBA as the holder of equitable charges under which the respondents were appointed.
13 Where goods were supplied directly by one or other of the applicants to one or other of the 'Betta Electrical', 'Betta', 'Chandlers' or 'Truscotts' franchisees, no bailment, trust or other issues are likely to arise in these proceedings except, perhaps, in relation to entitlements which one or other of the members of the Betta Group may have had to receive a rebate from the relevant supplier in respect of the sales to those franchisees.
