 (second court hearing) 
 
1 On 2 November 2007 I published reasons for judgment for orders that I had made on 17 October 2007 as varied on 26 October 2007 in these proceedings: see Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, in the matter of Publishing and Broadcasting Limited [2007] FCA 1610.
In proceeding NSD 1447 of 2007, I had ordered that the plaintiff, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL), convene a meeting of all holders of shares in PBL for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to a scheme of arrangement (the PBL Scheme).
In proceeding NSD 1448 of 2007, I had ordered that the plaintiff, Crown Limited (Crown), convene a meeting of all holders of shares in Crown for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to a scheme of arrangement (Demerger Scheme).
2 The PBL Scheme Meeting was held on 23 November 2007 and the Demerger Scheme Meeting was held later on the same day.
3 The PBL Shareholders present and voting (either in person or by proxy) passed a resolution approving the PBL Scheme by the majorities referred to in s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act).
The Crown shareholders present and voting (either in person or by proxy) passed a resolution approving the Demerger Scheme also by the majorities required by s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Act.
4 At the second court hearing held on 28 November 2007, I made orders confirming the two Schemes.
These are my reasons for doing so.
5 The nature of the two Schemes and other matters were set out in some detail in my earlier reasons for directing the convening of the meetings, and I incorporate those earlier reasons as part of my reasons for confirming the two Schemes.
7 No person appeared at the second court hearing to oppose, or to make submissions in relation to, confirmation of the two Schemes, and no shareholder had given any indication of intending to oppose either Scheme.
8 It was my opinion that both Schemes should be confirmed and I made orders accordingly.
I certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren.
