 

 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The first plaintiff, Carl Frauenstein ( Carl ), and the first three defendants, Tobias Farinha ( Toby ), Miguel Farinha ( Miguel ) and Marco Zagato ( Marco ) have been jointly involved in three businesses.
The businesses consist of a restaurant business known as " Moda " carried on at the Westfield Shopping Mall at Bondi Junction, a caf business known as " Momo " also carried on at Westfield at Bondi Junction and a bar and gaming lounge business known as " Equilibrium " carried on in the World Square Shopping Centre in George Street, Sydney.
Toby is Miguel's father and Marco's father-in-law.
It is convenient to refer to Toby, Miguel and Marco jointly as the Farinhas .
I shall generally refer to corporate entities connected with the Farinhas as the San Marco Group .
2 While the relationship between Carl and the Farinhas began as one of trust and cooperation, the relationship has soured and they have lost trust in each other.
As a consequence, they have engaged in expensive litigation to resolve issues that should sensibly have been resolved by mediation or other extra curial means.
3 The three businesses have been carried on by the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants, San Marco Bondi Junction Pty Limited ( Bondi Junction ), San Marco Piccolo Pty Limited ( Piccolo ) and San Marco World Square Pty Limited ( World Square ) respectively.
That is to say, Bondi Junction carries on the Moda business, Piccolo carries on the Momo business and World Square operates the Equilibrium business.
However, as will become apparent, the Moda and Momo businesses have tended to merge into one business carried on by Bondi Junction.
4 A significant issue in the proceeding is whether Bondi Junction, Piccolo and World Square carry on the businesses beneficially or in some nominee or trustee capacity.
The Farinhas say that Bondi Junction, Piccolo and World Square carry on their respective businesses as nominee for various partnerships.
They say that a partnership, consisting of Toby Bondi Junction Pty Limited ( Toby Bondi Junction ), Marco Bondi Junction Pty Limited ( Marco Bondi Junction ) and Miguel Bondi Junction Pty Limited ( Miguel Bondi Junction ), which are controlled by Toby, Marco and Miguel respectively and Carl Bondi Junction Pty Limited ( Carl Bondi Junction ), which is controlled by Carl, carries on the Moda and Momo businesses.
They also say that Cine San Marco Pty Limited ( Cine ) which is controlled by the Farinhas, and Carl World Square Pty Limited ( Carl World Square ), which is controlled by Carl, carry on the Equilibrium business in partnership.
5 All of the relevant corporate entities have been joined as parties to the proceeding, either as plaintiffs or defendants.
Cine and Toby Bondi Junction, Marco Bondi Junction and Miguel Bondi Junction seek orders, by way of cross-claim, that the alleged partnerships be wound up and that an account of profits and losses be taken.
6 It is common ground that Carl and the Farinhas were to be involved in corporate entities that were to engage in one way or another in the conduct of the three businesses.
Further, it is not disputed that Carl made payments exceeding $1,800,000 in connection with the three businesses.
However, there is a dispute between the parties as to how those payments should be characterised.
Carl claims that all of the payments should be characterised as advances on loan account.
The Farinhas say, on the other hand, that the payments should be treated as contributions to the equity of the alleged partnerships.
7 There is another dispute as to the identity of the entity or entities to which Carl's payments were made.
Carl adduced evidence from Ms Fiona Marie Bateman, a chartered accountant who specialises in forensic accountancy.
Ms Batemen reported that, following a detailed examination of the books and records of various entities involved with the businesses, she was unable to determine how some of the payments should be allocated among the three businesses.
8 There are also particular disputes between the parties concerning the share capital of World Square.
The first dispute concerns a written agreement involving Carl, Toby and Marco dated 20 July 2005 ( the Letter Agreement ), whereby it was agreed that, if a binding written agreement relating to their interest in the World Square project was not entered into by 7 September 2005, then, at the option of any of the parties, Toby and Marco were to arrange for the repayment of all monies invested by Carl in the World Square project and Carl's interest in the project would be transferred to the other parties.
Carl claims that the option was not properly exercised or, if it was, that there is no longer any agreement on foot.
9 The second dispute concerns the purported allotment of a substantial number of shares in the capital of World Square to the eighth defendant, Equal 54 Pty Limited ( Equal 54 ).
The Farinhas now say that, by reason of failure to comply with the Constitution of World Square, the purported allotment was ineffective.
Carl, on the other hand, says that, whether or not the allotment was effective, it was an instance of unfair and oppressive conduct in relation to the affairs of World Square.
Equal 54 was joined as a defendant but, having regard to the contention by the Farinhas that the allotment was ineffective, it has not played a substantive part in the proceeding.
10 Carl owns 40% of the issued capital of Bondi Junction and 40% of the issued capital of Piccolo.
Until the purported allotment to Equal 54, Carl held 30% of the issued capital of World Square.
Carl claims that the affairs of World Square, Bondi Junction and Piccolo have been conducted in a manner that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory against Carl in his capacity as a shareholder and in a manner that was or would be contrary to the interests of the members of those companies as a whole.
He therefore claims orders, under s 461 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ( the Corporations Act ), that the Farinhas or entities associated with them be required to buy his shares in those three companies for a value determined on the basis that the alleged unfair or oppressive conduct had not occurred.
11 The allegations of oppressive conduct involve an examination of allegations made by Carl of under reporting of revenue of the three businesses and overcharging of management, administration and other fees payable by the three businesses to the San Marco Group.
The parties accept that the question of the value to be attributed to Carl's shares in the three companies, if the relief claimed by him were to be ordered, should be the subject of a further hearing at which further evidence could be adduced and further submissions would be made.
12 Carl and the second plaintiff, Carpe Diem Initiatives Pty Limited ( Carpe Diem ), also seek declarations that Carpe Diem lent $550,000 to Toby and Marco or alternatively to the seventh defendant, Cockle Bay San Marco Pty Ltd ( Cockle Bay ), in order to fund a payment to Sherbet Creative Enterprises Pty Ltd. Cockle Bay is controlled by the Farinhas.
In the further alternative, Carl and Carpe Diem sought a declaration that the loan was guaranteed by Toby and Marco, without saying who was the borrower.
They claim that the loan fell due to be repaid to Carpe Diem on 30 November 2005.
13 As I apprehend the contentions of the parties, it is now common ground that, in March 2005, loans totalling $550,000 were made to Cockle Bay.
However, the Farinhas say that the loan was made by Carl personally and not by Carpe Diem.
Carl and Carpe Diem seek judgment in favour of Carpe Diem against Cockle Bay and do not press for declarations that the repayment of the loans to Cockle Bay was guaranteed by Toby or Marco.
14 The stance adopted by the Farinhas in relation to the loans totalling $550,000 is an essentially tactical one.
The tactical consideration appears to be that, if a partnership that involved Carl personally came into existence, the taking of accounts may require a further payment by Carl.
If the loans of $550,000 are owing to Carl, there may be a right of set off.
In the light of the conclusions that I have reached that no partnership was entered into involving Carl personally, the issue may not matter.
AMENDMENT 
 
15 Following the end of the oral evidence, Carl applied for leave to amend the statement of claim further and to file a further amended originating process.
It is fair to say that certain of the amendments were prompted by questions raised in the course of argument.
The amendments relate to the recovery of the payments made by Carl.
The amendments were proposed under two rubrics, namely, " Monies Lent " and " Monies Had and Received ".
Prior to the amendment application, the originating process had claimed declarations that the payments made by Carl had been advances to World Square, Bondi Junction and Piccolo on loan account.
The originating process also claimed orders that those companies repay the amounts.
Thus, it was clear that Carl had claimed repayment of the monies that he had paid and the proceeding was conducted on the basis that he was seeking repayment.
Insofar as the amendments sought recovery of monies advanced on loan account, the proposed amendments did not change or extend the nature of the claims made in the proceeding.
Accordingly, there was no real opposition from the Farinhas in relation to that aspect of the proposed amendments.
16 However, the claims under the rubric " Monies Had and Received " gave rise to difficulties.
The Farinhas said that, in so far as the proposed amendments sought to raise claims on common money counts, the pleading was defective because it failed to plead properly a case of unjust enrichment.
The Farinhas contended that it would be necessary for Carl to establish that each of the three companies was in fact enriched unjustly to the extent that it had received the monies in question, either on the basis of a total failure of consideration, or on the basis of some mistake as to the legal relationship which existed between the parties.
17 The Farinhas contended that they would be prejudiced by an amendment to plead such a case at that stage because they had conducted their defence up to that time on the basis of the existing pleadings, which did not call for the adducing of evidence, so they say, as to the precise manner in which the payments by Carl should be allocated between the three businesses.
They contended that any cause of action must depend upon some notion of unjust enrichment, which they said they had not had the opportunity to address.
More importantly, however, the Farinhas indicated that, in answer to such claims, they would wish to raise the defence of change of position.
While they accepted that the existence of a partnership had been an issue addressed by them in the conduct of the proceeding, the question of whether or not Bondi Junction, Piccolo and World Square had in fact received payments from Carl to the use of those companies had not been addressed.
The Farinhas said that such matters would need to be addressed by further evidence.
They claimed that they would require at least several weeks before such evidence could be adduced.
18 It was not suggested that the Farinhas might have adopted a different course in the conduct of the proceeding if the proposed amendments had been pleaded originally.
Accordingly, any unfairness to the Farinhas and the entities associated with them resulting from the proposed amendments, was able to be accommodated by affording them the opportunity to adduce additional evidence.
In the circumstances, I granted leave to Carl to make the amendments under both the rubric of " Money Lent " and the rubric of " Monies Had and Received ", on the basis that the first to seventh defendants would be entitled to file a defence to any further amended statement of claim and would be afforded the opportunity of adducing evidence and making further submissions in relation to the issues raised by that defence.
However, after several weeks, the Farinhas indicated to the Court that they do not wish to adduce further evidence on the new questions.
THE WITNESSES 
 
19 Carl and the Farinhas are all South African born but they now live in Australia.
Carl is qualified as a mechanical and aeronautical engineer.
In 1990 he became a management consultant and worked in that capacity from 1992 until 2000 when he retired.
Toby has been involved in running restaurant, hotel and liquor store businesses for over 40 years.
20 Carl was introduced to the Farinhas through a solicitor, Mr Colin Steingold.
Another connection between Carl and the Farinhas, prior to the events that are the subject of the proceeding, was Mr Alan Saidman, an accountant who acts for both Carl and the Farinhas.
While each of Messrs Saidman and Steingold may have been able to throw light on factual matters that are in dispute between Carl on the one hand and the Farninhas on the other, neither of them was called to give evidence by either side.
While mechanisms would have been available for either to be called as a witness by the Court, if necessary, neither side availed itself of such mechanisms.
21 Carl met Mr Saidman in 1997 when Mr Saidman became his accountant.
In 2001, Mr Saidman introduced Carl to Mr Steingold who then became Carl's solicitor.
In 2003, Mr Steingold introduced Carl to the Farinhas.
22 Carl gave evidence in chief both by affidavit and orally and was cross examined.
Carl's oral evidence in chief was clear and unequivocal.
Some of his evidence as to relevant conversations given by affidavit were not disputed by the Farinhas.
Despite the fact that Carl's evidence may have been rehearsed, I consider that he should be accepted as a truthful witness.
Accordingly, in so far as the conversations that occurred between Carl on the one hand and the Farinhas on the other are relevant to the issues, I accept the evidence given by Carl as a reliable version of those conversations.
In several instances, Carl did not give evidence in chief in relation to important conversations.
In those instances, I consider that the version given by Toby is a reliable version of the communications that occurred orally.
23 Carl, Toby, Marco and Miguel all gave oral evidence in the proceeding and each was cross-examined.
Each swore affidavits, some of which were quite extensive.
The affidavits dealt with numerous conversations between them concerning the projects at Bondi Junction and at the World Square development.
The evidence in chief in relation to significant disputed conversations was given orally.
On the other hand, several affidavits sworn by the Farinhas accepted that the conversations deposed to by Carl took place as he said and those parts of the Farinhas' affidavits were tendered as admissions.
In all of the circumstances, I have some confidence in making findings concerning the substance of relevant conversations.
THE ISSUES 
 
24 In his written submissions to the Court, Carl formulated eight factual issues.
The Farinhas did not quarrel with that formulation.
Some of the issues are interrelated and overlap.
The issues as I propose to address them may be summarised as follows.

 
 (1) Whether the Moda, Momo and Equilibrium businesses were owned by Bondi Junction, Piccolo and World Square beneficially, or whether those three companies were nominees of partnerships, consisting of entities associated with the Farinhas and Carl, which acted as trustees of trusts associated with the Farinhas and Carl.
(2) Whether payments made by Carl in connection with the businesses should be characterised as contributions to equity (whether of partnerships or otherwise) or as advances on loan account and, if the latter, to whom.
(3) Whether the option conferred by the Letter Agreement was effectively exercised and, if so, whether any agreement is still on foot.
(4) Whether the purported allotment of shares in the capital of World Square to Equal 54 was effective.
(5) Whether the accounts of the Moda and Momo businesses underestimate the revenues earned in relation to those businesses and whether management fees, consultancy fees, administration expenses and training costs that have been charged to the three businesses by the Farinhas, or entities associated with them, were properly charged to those businesses.
(6) Whether the affairs of World Square, Bondi Junction and Piccolo have been conducted in a manner that would attract the exercise of jurisdiction under s 461 of the Corporations Act .
(7) Whether the loans totalling $550,000 that were made to Cockle Bay in March 2005 were made by Carl or by Carpe Diem.

 

25 I shall state my conclusions in relation to each of those issues.
That will involve factual findings and some legal conclusions from those findings.
In that regard, it is necessary to describe in some detail the dealings between Carl and the Farinhas that led to the establishment of the businesses and their falling out.
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BUSINESSES AND THE DEMISE OF TRUST 
 
26 Bondi Junction was incorporated on 24 February 2004.
On 31 March 2004, Toby and Mr Steingold were appointed as directors of Bondi Junction.
At that stage, Carl had no involvement with any of the proposed ventures.
27 In late April or early May 2004, Carl and Mr Steingold had discussions concerning the possibility of the two of them participating with the Farinhas in the three proposed ventures.
Shortly thereafter, a discussion involving Carl, Mr Steingold and the Farinhas took place.
Carl gave no evidence in chief about such a discussion.
However, in cross-examination he did not deny that such a discussion took place and I accept that it did.
28 In the course of the discussion, Toby said that the Farinhas were happy to do the Bondi Junction deal with Carl and Mr Steingold on a 50/50 basis, with Carl and Mr Steingold being the financiers and the Farinhas managing the businesses.
Mr Steingold said that he and Carl were happy with that.
Toby said that, for the World Square business, the Farinhas would want a controlling interest so they would do that on a 60/40 basis, again with Carl and Mr Steingold as the financiers.
Carl and Mr Steingold both said that was fine with them.
Toby then asked Mr Steingold to draw up a partnership agreement for the ventures after he had spoken to Mr Saidman.
Mr Steingold said that he would.
29 Another meeting took place at Mr Saidman's offices at some time in the first part of 2004.
Toby says that the meeting was attended by Marco, Miguel, Carl, Mr Steingold and himself.
Miguel also gave evidence about such a meeting but I do not regard Miguel's evidence of the meeting as reliable: he made no mention of it in a statement that was provided in connection with the proceeding and was unable to give a satisfactory explanation, when giving oral evidence, as to how he subsequently came to recall the meeting.
Marco also gave evidence of a series of meetings that he attended at Mr Saidman's offices during April and May 2004, some of which were attended by Carl.
He said that the way in which the businesses would be structured was discussed.
Carl gave no evidence in chief about such a meeting.
However, while he said in cross-examination that he did not recall such a meeting, he did not deny that a discussion such as deposed to by Toby may have occurred.
In the circumstances, it is difficult to form any firm view as to the precise discussion that occurred at any such meeting.
However, on the balance of probabilities, I consider that such a meeting occurred and proceeded substantially as deposed to by Toby.
30 At the meeting, Toby told Mr Saidman that Carl, Mr Steingold and the Farinhas had agreed that Carl and Mr Steingold would take 50% and the Farinhas would take the other 50% of the Bondi Junction businesses as a partnership, and that the Farinhas would take 60% and Carl and Mr Steingold would take 40% of the World Square business as a partnership.
Toby asked Mr Saidman whether he had any suggestions as to how they should structure the arrangements so as to be most tax effective for everybody.
Mr Saidman asked whether they planned to sell the businesses in the future.
Toby said that they may want to sell the Bondi Junction operation when it was up and running and profitable.
31 Mr Saidman said that it would probably be best if they established ' hybrid trusts ' for each of their usual family trusts and made them the partners in the partnerships.
He said that he would form new nominee companies to carry on the businesses on behalf of the partnerships.
He said that the new companies would only be nominees of the partnerships, so that all income would flow through to the hybrid trusts and the companies would file nil returns for tax purposes.
He said that each of the participants would hold shares in the nominee companies in proportion to their interests in the businesses.
Mr Steingold said that he would draw up agreements on that basis.
No one gave any evidence as to the meaning of the term " hybrid trust ".
It could possibly refer to a trust that had characteristics of different kinds of trust, such as a discretionary trust and a unit trust.
Nothing appears to turn on the meaning of the term.
32 World Square was incorporated on 4 June 2004 with an issued capital of 10 shares.
Of those shares, 6 were issued to Cockle Bay and 2 were issued to each of Carl and Steingold.
Toby, Miguel, Marco and Mr Steingold were appointed as directors of World Square.
On 8 June 2004, Marco, Miguel and Carl were also appointed directors of Bondi Junction.
33 On 24 June 2004, Carl received a draft partnership deed from Mr Steingold.
At about the same time, Toby and Marco also received a copy of the draft.
The draft was expressed to relate to the conduct of a restaurant business at the Westfield Shopping Mall at Bondi Junction.
It provided that Bondi Junction would act as nominee of the partnership in accordance with the directions of the partners.
The partners were to be companies controlled by each of Toby, Miguel, Marco, Carl and Mr Steingold, which were referred to in the draft respectively as Toby Co, Miguel Co, Marco Co, Carl Co and Colin Co. Companies by that name have never existed.
According to the draft partnership deed, the respective proportions of the partners in the partnership were to be:
 
 
 
 Toby Co: 25.84%
 Miguel Co: 7.50%
 Marco Co: 16.66%
 Carl Co: 25.00%
 Colin Co: 25.00% 
 
 

The draft partnership deed provided expressly that Bondi Junction was not to be a member of the partnership.
It also provided that the partnership was to be managed and controlled by a committee to consist of nominees appointed by each partner.
34 After he received the draft Carl considered it in some detail and made a number of handwritten notations on the draft.
Where he did not make a note against a provision of the draft, he placed a tick.
He said that the tick simply indicated that he had read, but had no comment on, the provision.
He denied that it signified any approval of the provision.
35 Carl also showed the draft to Mr Jonathan Hendy, a lawyer friend of his from South Africa, who happened to be visiting Sydney at the time.
Mr Hendy made some handwritten notes on the draft and handed it back to Carl shortly before he, Mr Hendy, returned to South Africa.
Carl did not discuss the draft with Mr Hendy and he did not consider Mr Hendy's notes particularly carefully.
Mr Hendy's notes recorded that, under the structure proposed by the draft, a partnership would own the restaurant business and that Bondi Junction would conduct the business.
His notes indicated that the partners would participate in profits and losses.
The notes also indicated that the partnership was " not limited " and said " liability not restricted ".
36 The Farinhas did not consider that the draft partnership deed was acceptable.
They thought that it favoured Carl and Mr Steingold unfairly.
In any event, nothing further was done in relation to the draft.
37 On 5 August 2004, Mr Steingold sent to Mr Saidman a draft Unit Trust Deed establishing " the Carl Bondi Junction Trust ".
Mr Saidman responded on 6 August 2004, saying that he had reviewed portions of the draft trust deed and expressed a preference that " Carl's trust " should also be a party to the trust deed and that certain units should be issued directly to that trust rather than to Carl.
38 On 13 August 2004, Mr Saidman sent to Carl a copy of a communication received from the Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) that assigned a tax file number and an Australian Business Number for the Carl Bondi Junction Trust and its trustee.
At around the same time, Carl Bondi Junction and Carl World Square were incorporated.
It is tolerably clear that those companies were intended to be trustees of trusts ultimately controlled by Carl and that they were intended to be members of the partnerships that were to be formed to carry on the three businesses.
39 On 10 September 2004, Mr Saidman sent two letters to Carl, one relating to the Carl World Square Trust and one relating to the Carl Bondi Junction Trust.
The letters enclosed trust deeds establishing the Carl World Square Trust and the Carl Bondi Junction Trust respectively, together with draft minutes of meetings of the directors of Carl World Square and Carl Bondi Junction.
The letters also attached invoices for fees due to Mr Steingold's firm in connection with the preparation of the trust deeds and ancillary documents.
Carl paid those invoices.
40 The trust deeds for Carl World Square Trust and Carl Bondi Junction Trust were apparently executed in early October 2004 since, on 12 October 2004, Mr Saidman's personal assistant thanked Carl for dropping off the signed documents in the previous week.
However, there is no evidence as to whether resolutions were passed or contemplated by the draft minutes that Mr Steingold sent to Carl.
41 On 8 February 2005, Mr Saidman sent to Mr Steingold a copy of the first two pages of the trust deed establishing the Carl World Square Trust.
The copy of the first two pages shows that the deed bore the date 10 September 2005 and that it had been duly stamped.
The balance of the deed was not in evidence.
There was no evidence as to what the trust property was or who the beneficiaries are.
Whether the trust deed established a hybrid trust is totally unclear.
42 Piccolo was incorporated on 30 June 2004, when Toby, Miguel, Marco, Mr Steingold and Carl were appointed directors.
As at 30 June 2004, the issued capital of each of Piccolo and Bondi Junction was 100 shares.
50 shares in Piccolo were held by San Marco Group Pty Limited and 50 shares in Bondi Junction were held by Cockle Bay.
25 shares in each of Piccolo and Bondi Junction were held by each of Carl and Mr Steingold.
43 During August 2004 Carl told Mr Steingold that he was no longer prepared to lend him funds for the ventures on the terms that Mr Steingold wanted.
As a consequence, there was a falling out between Carl and Mr Steingold.
Carl told Toby and Mr Saidman, at a meeting in mid-August 2004, that he would be happy to walk away from the ventures if they did not want him to participate, having regard to his falling out with Mr Steingold.
Toby said that they wanted Carl with them.
In late August and in early to mid September, Carl had discussions with Toby concerning the basis upon which Carl would take over either part or all of Mr Steingold's interest in the ventures.
44 In early October 2004, the Momo business opened for trading.
Work was continuing on the Moda premises at that stage.
It appears that the landlord was required to carry out further works to strengthen a floor to support a mezzanine level.
45 On 11 October 2004 Mr Saidman wrote to Toby, saying that he was enclosing a " draft memorandum " that he had prepared to give effect to what he understood the arrangements to be with Mr Steingold.
He said that he had not passed it on to either Carl or Mr Steingold at that stage, since he thought he would first get Toby's confirmation.
Carl subsequently received a copy of the letter with the enclosed memorandum.
There are at least three versions of the memorandum and the circumstances surrounding the preparation of the successive versions are somewhat obscure.
46 The terms of the memorandum are not particularly significant in themselves, in that they deal with the proposed arrangements with Mr Steingold.
However, all of the various versions of the memorandum refer to a proposed partnership in relation to the World Square development.
Thus, the memorandum again corroborates the evidence of the Farinhas to the effect that the parties contemplated that a partnership would be established.
On the other hand, the terms of the memorandum also indicate that, at that stage, no finality had been reached as to the terms of any partnership.
47 On 23 December 2004, Mr Steingold ceased to be a director of World Square, Piccolo and Bondi Junction.
On 7 February 2005, 15 shares in the capital of Bondi Junction were transferred from Mr Steingold to Carl and 10 shares were transferred from Mr Steingold to Cockle Bay.
The consequence was that the shareholdings in Bondi Junction were then Farinhas 60% and Carl 40%.
On 21 and 22 March 2005, 64 shares in the capital of World Square were issued to Cockle Bay, 23 shares were issued to Carl and three shares were issued to Shadean (World Square) Pty Ltd ( Shadean ), a company controlled by Mr Steingold.
At the same time, the two shares in World Square held by Mr Steingold were transferred to Shadean.
The consequence was that the shareholdings in World Square were then the Farinhas 70%, Carl 25% and Mr Steingold 5%.
48 By March 2005, the design for the World Square project had been finalised and timelines for construction had been prepared.
A building contract was entered into for a sum of $6,500,000 with construction to start in March or April 2005.
49 On 30 March 2005, Carl wrote to Marco concerning a proposed guarantee for additional funding from the Bank of New Zealand.
The letter began as follows:
 
 "To date, I have fully funded my personal obligations to the project.
I have furthermore fully funded the obligation of Colin Steingold in the project.
I have also partially funded a small portion of the San Marco Group obligations in the project.
I have now been approached to provide further support in the form of a bank guarantee to the value of $AUS750,000.
" 
 

The letter went on to set out the conditions upon which Carl would be prepared to give a bank guarantee.
Marco responded on 31 March 2005, indicating that certain of Carl's conditions would not be agreed to, since they involved a dilution of the Farinhas' shares in the ventures.
50 In early April 2005 Moda opened for trading.
51 On 13 April 2005 Carl wrote to Toby concerning the World Square project.
He began by referring to the proposed San Marco World Square Partnership and the status of participation.
He said that the proposed participation in the partnership was 60/20/20 and the " managing company " was registered accordingly.
Carl said, however, that that was always subject to finalising the individual contribution of each participant.
To that end, he said, Mr Steingold approached him for a loan that would enable him to participate to the level of a 20% partnership.
52 Carl then went on, in his letter, to describe the breakdown of his relationship with Mr Steingold such that Carl could not provide funding to Mr Steingold.
Carl referred to a proposal whereby Mr Steingold would participate to 5%.
Carl said that he had not heard back from Mr Steingold since writing to him on 31 March 2005 and that he was therefore withdrawing from negotiating as to any more proposals for Mr Steingold to have 5% of the World Square project.
53 Carl also said that he was not going to consider or accept any " proposed partnership participation " until such time as an amicable funding structure was agreed.
He said that he had been funding in excess of 45% of the project needs and therefore requested that no partnership structure or participation be deemed to be agreed until such time as a fair agreement could be concluded based on participation, contribution and risk exposure.
He suggested that the four directors of World Square call a meeting as soon as practicable to resolve the matter.
54 The references to a partnership in Carl's letter support the Farinhas' contention that a partnership structure was contemplated.
However, it is clear from the terms of the letter that no consensus as to the terms of any partnership had been reached at that stage.
55 On 21 April 2005, Mr Saidman sent to ANZ Private Banking, Carl's bankers, a letter of 21 April 2005 from Marco and Miguel.
Mr Saidman's letter said that the interests held by Carl in the various ventures were held by entities owned and controlled by him rather than by him personally.
The letter also said that the ventures were " operated as partnerships " and that Carl's entities had partnership shares equal to the percentages set out in the enclosed letter.
The enclosed letter, signed by Marco and Miguel, said as follows:
 
 "We would like to confirm that Carl Frauenstein has 40% of the two ventures in Westfield Bondi Junction being San Marco Bondi Junction Pty Ltd trading as Moda Bar  Restaurant and San Marco Piccolo Pty Ltd trading as Momo's Bar and Caf.
Carl currently has 25% of San Marco World Square Pty Ltd and is negotiating a further 5%.
We also confirm that Carl Frauenstein has invested $1,658,930 in the three ventures mentioned above.
" 
 

56 There was no evidence that the letter was sent to Carl, who says that he does not recall seeing the letter, notwithstanding that it was being sent to his own bankers.
The Farinhas place some store on the contents of the letter.
However, while it confirms the parties' intention of establishing partnerships, it does not itself constitute evidence of the establishment of any partnership at that stage.
57 On 17 May 2005, Carl met with Toby and Miguel at Moda.
Carl said that he was particularly concerned about the lack of transparency and management of the finances for the ventures.
He said that he had no accurate idea of how the businesses were trading and how the capital expenditure was going.
Carl suggested that they should have formal operational budgets agreed for all ventures and in particular for Momo and Moda.
He said that the budgets for Momo and Moda would need to be agreed before mid-June and the budget for World Square before mid-August, when the Equilibrium business was to open.
Toby said that he agreed.
Carl said that he could not be expected to put more money into the ventures without having agreed to budgets and the degree of expenditure.
Toby said that he would see to it that those matters were " actioned ".
58 On 18 May 2005, Carl sent an email to Marco and Mr Saidman, in which he referred to the meeting with Toby and Miguel on 17 May 2005.
