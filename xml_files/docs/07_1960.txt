 (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT) 
 
1 Mrs Clark, the applicant, has applied to discontinue these proceedings which are currently now only brought against Adept Super  Life Pty Limited, the second respondent.
Her application is made under O 22 r 2(1)(d) which provides that a party making a claim for relief may discontinue a proceeding:
 
 '... at any time --- with the leave of the Court.
' 


 
2 The position of Adept is that leave should only be granted on condition that Mrs Clark pay its costs of the proceedings.
Adept estimates the amount of its costs recoverable on a taxation to be about $25,000.
BACKGROUND 
 
3 The proceedings arose because Mrs Clark and her husband came to review their insurance arrangements in late 2004.
Mrs Clark is the mother of three young children.
At that time, the youngest was about three years of age.
She described her occupation in the proposal for insurance, completed with Adept's assistance, as 'home duties'.
Her husband was a coal miner.
4 In January 2003 Mrs Clark had taken out life and trauma insurance cover with Suncorp Metway Life  Superannuation Limited providing for a maximum benefit of about $260,000 should she be diagnosed with a 'critical condition', one of which was breast cancer.
She renewed that policy in late December 2003 for a further year.
During the course of 2004 Mrs Clark became aware of a lump in her right breast.
She claimed to have consulted medical practitioners who advised her that the lump was a cyst and not malignant.
5 In early November 2004, Mr Budin, an employee of Adept, attended at the home of Mr and Mrs Clark.
He assisted her in completing an application form for life and trauma insurance cover with ING Life Limited, the first respondent.
ING issued a policy to Mrs Clark on about 30 November 2004 which provided for a cover of $250,000 in respect of a diagnosis of breast cancer.
However, during the course of November 2004, Mrs Clark's breast condition needed further medical attention.
She prepared an affidavit for the purpose of this costs application.
There is a substantial issue discussed in it as to precisely what diagnosis she should have been aware of and what, if anything, may have been required to be disclosed by her to ING under her duty of disclosure pursuant to the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth).
6 Mrs Clark's statement of claim was filed on 26 July 2007.
It joined only ING and Adept.
It alleged that on or about 6 December 2004 Mrs Clark contracted, and was diagnosed with, breast cancer.
In January 2005 she made a claim on the ING policy.
That claim was declined by ING in April 2005.
Also, at some stage during 2005, she lodged a claim on the Suncorp policy.
It too was declined on two bases.
First, Suncorp asserted that, at the time of the claim, Mrs Clark was not the subject of a policy issued by it which was then in force.
Secondly, Suncorp declined on the basis that the diagnosis of a breast cancer tumour failed to meet what it asserted was the policy's requirement that it be of such severity as to require a full mastectomy.
7 In her original statement of claim, Mrs Clark alleged breaches of the Insurance Contracts Act against ING and breaches s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), against, relevantly, Adept.
