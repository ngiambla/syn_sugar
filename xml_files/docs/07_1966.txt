 
1 CPA Australia Ltd ("CPA Australia") is an incorporated body of accountants.
It has brought proceedings against Stephen Dunn who is a practising accountant, but not a member of the applicant body.
It seeks to restrain Mr Dunn from representing, in connection with the provision, promotion or supply of his professional services, that he is a "Certified Practising Accountant", a "Certified Public Accountant" or a "CPA".
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
2 There are three recognised bodies of accountants in Australia.
The applicant is one.
The others are the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, and the National Institute of Accountants.
The applicant is by far the largest of these three bodies.
It has over 112,000 members, and its officers and staff are based in 18 offices located across Australia, Asia and Europe.
3 The applicant can trace its origins back to the late 19 th Century.
After a series of name changes, it finally acquired its present designation in 2000.
One class of the applicant's membership is that of "Certified Practising Accountant".
That expression, and its commonly used abbreviation "CPA", have been widely adopted since at least 1983 to describe those of the applicant's members who have been recognised as such according to the applicant's bylaws.
In order to qualify for this designation, members are required to have tertiary qualifications in accountancy and to complete a program created for this purpose which includes examinations and continuing professional development.
The evidence overwhelmingly points to the fact that the public use by the applicant and its members of the term "Certified Practising Accountant" and its abbreviation "CPA" is extensive and widespread.
4 The applicant has been accorded statutory recognition throughout Australia.
For example, it is expressly mentioned, along with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the National Institute of Accountants, in various provisions of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (Vic), the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 (NSW) and the Property Agents and Land Transactions Act 2005 (Tas).
Some statutes refer to the applicant and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia only.
See for example the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 1282 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) s 203(1).
5 In addition, the applicant is specifically recognised in reference works such as the Penguin Macquarie Dictionary of Economics  Finance .
The term "Certified Practising Accountant" or "CPA" is defined as:
 
 "A member of the AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY OF ACCOUNTANTS who has completed a minimum number of hours additional study above the Society's entry requirements and intends to continue to keep abreast of new accounting practices and developments.
This new, higher class of accountants was introduced in 1983.
" 
 

6 The applicant actively promotes its various designations.
It also spends considerable amounts each year on the further education of its members, and on the recruitment of new members.
7 Mr Dunn is a qualified accountant.
As previously indicated, he is not a member of the applicant.
Nor is he a member of either of the other umbrella organisations of accountants.
He describes himself as "proudly independent".
He has no interest in joining any such organisation, and he exhibits barely disguised contempt for them.
He has long been engaged in challenging their right to hold themselves out as having some special expertise which he lacks.
See, for example, Dunn v Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants (1996) ATPR |P41-461; Dunn v Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants [1996] FCA 1193 ; Dunn v Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants [1998] FCA 1199 ; and Dunn v Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants [1999] FCA 651.
8 Mr Dunn has gone out of his way to induce the applicant to bring these proceedings by writing to it and its solicitors, threatening to use various designations, including the terms "Certified Practising Accountant" and "Certified Public Accountant", in his professional letterhead.
For example, on 14 July 2006, he sent a letter to the applicant on letterhead describing himself as a Certified Practising Accountant and stating that he would use that designation "on my letterheads and promotional materials in the future".
