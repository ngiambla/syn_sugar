(a) "That the decision of the Tribunal dated 2 October 2006 be set aside;
 
(b) Orders declaring that pursuant to the terms of insurance dated 18 October 2001 establish by the Trustee for the Applicant:-
 
i. the Applicant's medical condition namely Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Anxiety Disorder is not related to his schizophrenia; and
