The respondents (together 'Dayals') distribute in Australia water bottled in Fiji under the brand name "Island Chill".
Mr Jay Dayal ('Mr Dayal') is a director of the first respondent ('Artesian Waters') and is actively engaged in its day to day management and control.
Mr Dayal's father and mother are also directors of Artesian Waters.
The family operates a hardwood export business and it was Mr Dayal's idea in 2001 that they enter the bottled water market.
He was responsible for the marketing "get-up" of the Island Chill product, including bottle shape and label design.
Mr Pranesh Dayal is Mr Dayal's younger brother and trading partner in Australia.
He reports to Mr Dayal daily in relation to Dayals' business activities in Australia.
2 Natural Waters alleges, in broad terms, contraventions of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act'), ss 42 and 44 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and passing off by Dayals because of the packaging of Island Chill.
These causes of action are each founded on the assertion that Island Chill's packaging shares a sufficient number of the features of Fiji Water's packaging so as to give rise to a representation that there is at least an association between the products and between Natural Waters and Dayals, where there is none.
Natural Waters and Artesian Waters both own registered trade marks in Australia but no allegation of trade mark infringement is pleaded.
