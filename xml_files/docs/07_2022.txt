1 On Sunday, 24 August 2003, the plaintiffs, Mr Mark Ruaro and Mrs Secilia Ruaro, were the owners of a twin screw, inboard powered, raised bridge, wood, motor yacht approximately 56 feet in length built in 1938 by Holmes Brothers in Sydney, known as "Seaquest".
Seaquest was bought by Mr and Mrs Ruaro in 1993 and, thereafter, they carried out major restoration works on Seaquest.
Seaquest was their pride and joy.
2 On 24 August 2003, Seaquest was attached to a swing mooring in Rose Bay, which is part of Sydney Harbour, pursuant to a licence granted by the defendant, Holcomm Marine Pty Limited ( Holmeport ).
In severe weather conditions in the afternoon of that day, another vessel, Pavana, which was attached to a swing mooring located more than 100 m distant from Seaquest, dragged its mooring until it came into contact with Seaquest.
Over a period of approximately one hour, the contact between the two vessels led to the severance of the rope securing Seaquest to its swing mooring.
Seaquest was then driven by the wind across Rose Bay to the Eastern sea wall where it was battered to such an extent that it broke up and was a total loss.
3 Mr and Mrs Ruaro have commenced a proceeding against Holmeport claiming damages in respect of the loss of Seaquest.
