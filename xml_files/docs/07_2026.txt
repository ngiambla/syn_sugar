 
1 This proceeding is concerned with the validity of notices issued under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) ( the Act ) requiring the production to the Australian Crime Commission ( the Commission ) of documents in respect of which there may be a claim for legal professional privilege.
The applicants claim to have legal professional privilege in relation to documents produced by third parties in response to such notices.
They claim the return of documents in respect of which legal professional privilege is asserted to exist.
2 The Court has conducted a final hearing on the basis of admissions made on the pleadings.
However, if the applicants succeed in their primary contentions, it will be necessary for there to be a further inquiry in order to identify relevant documents and to determine what consequences should flow if it be the fact that privileged documents have been produced to the Commission without the consent of the applicants.
3 In order to put the issues raised in the proceeding in context, it is necessary to say something about the scheme of the Act.
I shall then say something about the relevant facts arising from the pleadings.
