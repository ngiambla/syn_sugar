Mr James Sutton was the manager and owner of Finlay Engineering.
Mr Adam Sutton was a director and the secretary of the company.
The company had nine employees whose employment was regulated by the Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award 1998 and by successive certified agreements.
2 On 5 April 2006 Mr James Sutton presented these employees with Australian Workplace Agreements ("AWAs").
He told them that, if they signed the agreements, there would be no change to their terms and conditions of employment.
Each employee signed an AWA on that day.
None would have done so had he known that the AWA contained a term which reduced the quantum of redundancy payments to which the employees were entitled under the certified agreements.
Had the employees been aware of this and the misstatement made to them by Mr James Sutton, they would not have entered into the AWAs.
3 The employees were not provided with the AWAs for the seven day period prescribed by s 337(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ").
Nor were they provided with an information statement as required by s 337(2) of the Act .
Both respondents were responsible for these contraventions of s 337(8) and (9) of the Act .
These contraventions deprived the employees of the opportunity to ascertain the true position relating to their respective redundancy payment entitlements under the AWAs.
4 None of the AWAs was witnessed as required by the Act : see ss 340(1)(b) and 341 .
Mr Adam Sutton later signed the AWAs on behalf of the company.
Mr James Sutton was aware that he had done this.
These contraventions did not contribute to the decision of any employee to enter into an AWA.
5 Not long after the AWAs were signed the company appointed administrators.
On 27 June 2006 it went into liquidation.
This resulted in all the employees being made redundant.
Most of them were long serving employees who would have been entitled to much higher severance payments under the certified agreement which had regulated their employment prior to them signing the AWAs.
This was because the certified agreement provided for an entitlement to three weeks pay for each year of service.
The AWAs provided for a less generous entitlement for each year of service and the amount payable was capped at 12 weeks.
6 The applicant is a Workplace Inspector appointed under s 167(2) of the Act .
An investigation was conducted into the conduct of the respondents.
They were initially disposed to deny liability but, at a point before serious expense was incurred by the applicant in preparing for trial, they admitted their liability.
Agreement was reached between the applicant and the respondents as to the penalties which they considered it would be appropriate for the Court to impose in respect of the various contraventions.
7 The Court is not bound to accept and impose these proposed penalties but will do so if persuaded that, in all the circumstances, they fall within the permissible range: cf NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290-1.
In Ponzio v B  P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 543 at 565 Jessup J expressed the view, with which I respectfully agree, that the phrase "permissible range" in this context "refers to a range which would be permitted by the court, that is, a range within which the penalty is neither manifestly inadequate nor manifestly excessive.
