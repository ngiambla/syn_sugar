MITSUI: 90% HOLDER IN SAH 
 
5 On 31 July 2006, Mitsui and Mitsui Australia acquired all of their aggregate 94.2% interest in the ordinary shares of SAH and 73.9% interest in the A class shares of SAH pursuant to a Share Sale Agreement dated 31 May 2006 ("Share Sale Agreement") between Mitsui, Akzo and Akzo NV.
These acquisitions by Mitsui constituted it a "90% Holder" in relation to securities in SAH by reason of s 664A of the Act.
COMPULSORY ACQUISITION PROCESS 
 
6 On 1 August 2006, Mitsui informed Sempurna and Hanwha that it would exercise its right under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares of SAH held by Sempurna and Hanwha.
7 On 19 January 2007, PKF Corporate Advisory Services (NSW) Pty Ltd provided Mitsui with its independent expert report.
PFK concluded, among other things, that the terms proposed by Mitsui for the acquisition of Hanwha's and Sempurna's shares equalled or exceeded PKF's assessment of fair value for their shares in SAH.
8 Mitsui offered, under the compulsory acquisition notice dated 25 January 2007 concerning the shares of SAH ("Notice"), to pay Hanwha the same amount per share that Mitsui (and Mitsui Australia) paid Akzo under the Share Sale Agreement for its ordinary shares in SAH.
Sempurna was offered the same price for its ordinary shares.
9 By the Notice, Mitsui offered to pay a cash amount that was effectively subject to four specified adjustments contained in a summary of the Share Sale Agreement (SSA) between Mitsui and Akzo and attached, as Annexure 'A' to the Notice.
The nature of the adjustments was the subject of specific definition, in the Notice, relevantly, as follows: 
 
 
 '4.
The 90% Holder hereby gives notice that it proposes to compulsorily acquire ordinary shares that you hold for the cash amount of $16.1657119780 per share, as calculated in accordance with item (e)(iii)(B) of Annexure A and subject to the further adjustments in items (c), (d) and (e)(ii) of Annexure A.
"Annexure A" 
 
 .
.
.

 
 
 
 
 (c) An adjustment is to be made to the Initial Purchase Price pursuant to an agreed formula if Onslow receives any insurance payment ("Cyclone Insurance Payment") in relation to claims made by Onslow under its property damage and business interruption insurance ("Insurance Claim") in connection with Tropical Cyclones Glenda and Hubert in March and April 2006 ("Cyclones").
At the date of this notice, there has been no adjustment pursuant to this provision.
This adjustment to Hanwha will be calculated as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 (Cyclone Insurance Payment net of all costs incurred by Onslow in connection with the enforcement of the Insurance Claim (if any), and any tax payable by Onslow in respect thereof) X 0.0347.

 
 
 
 
 (d) An adjustment is to be made to the Initial Purchase Price in accordance with an agreed formula to restore assets of the Group to their original working order prior to the Cyclones.
At the date of this notice, there has been no adjustment pursuant to this provision.
This adjustment to Hanwha will be calculated by multiplying 0.0347 with any balance amount between the actual liabilities Onslow will incur for the repairs and the amount of the write-down of the fixed assets in the Completion Accounts (as defined in paragraph (e) below), according to the agreed scope of repair work under the SSA.
(e) An adjustment is to be made to the Initial Purchase Price in the event that Akzo's interest in the net assets ("Net Assets Amount") of the Company and Onslow (together, the "Group") as at the close of business on 31 July 2006 ("Completion Date") as set out in audited financial statements for the Group ("Completion Accounts") is more or less than the aggregate of Akzo's interest in the net assets as at 31 December 2005 ("Accounts Net Asset Amount") and the estimated amount by which the Accounts Net Asset Amount changed between 31 December 2005 and Completion Date.
.
.
.

 
 
 
 (ii) However, each of the parties has disputed the Completion Accounts pursuant to the SSA and the disputed matters are currently the subject of a dispute resolution procedure which requires the dispute to be determined by a firm of chartered accountants ("Independent Accountant").
The Independent Accountant's determination will be final and binding on the parties and the Initial Purchase Price will be adjusted in accordance with that determination.
The adjustment may be in accordance with the Completion Accounts as set out in paragraph (i) above, the 90% Holder's dispute notice or Akzo's dispute notice as set out in paragraphs (iii) or (iv) below, or such other amount determined by the Independent Accountant.
It is expected that the Independent Accountant's determination will be finalised in February 2007.

10 Hanwha lodged an objection under s 664E of the Act to the compulsory acquisition of its 206,897 ordinary shares and 3,793,103 A class shares in SAH.
Sempurna has lodged an objection under s 664E of the Act to the compulsory acquisition of the 2,062,500 A class shares it holds in SAH.
11 Mitsui has applied, given the objections, for approval, under s 664F of the Act , of its compulsory acquisition of the ordinary and A class shares in SAH held by Hanwha and Sempurna.
12 By Orders dated 11 April 2007, Nicholson J, under para 2, ordered, relevantly, that Hanwha be entitled to file a statement listing the grounds of and reasons for its objection to the compulsory acquisition of its shares in SAH by Mitsui.
13 Hanwha filed such a statement on 4 May 2007 entitled "Hanwha's statement pursuant to paragraph 2 of the orders made by Nicholson J on 11 April 2007" (Hanwha's Statement).
Ground 1(a) in Hanwha's Statement is in the following terms: 
 
 The Compulsory Acquisition Notice given by the plaintiff to Hanwha does not set out the "cash sum" for which the plaintiff proposes to acquire the ordinary shares of SAH held by Hanwha.
(The Cash Sum Objection)
 

14 By Notice of Motion dated 8 October 2007, Mitsui sought an order that the Cash Sum Objection be determined by the Court as a preliminary issue.
15 It also sought an order that the period set out in section 664AA of the Act be extended, pursuant to s 1322(4)(d) of the Act , so that the period ends three months after the date of such an order being made ("Extension of Time Order").
The effect of s 664AA is that the 90% holder may compulsorily acquire the relevant securities only if it lodged the compulsory acquisition notice for the acquisition with ASIC within the period of 6 months after it became a 90% holder.
16 In order to avoid an interlocutory dispute in the present proceeding as to whether the Court has power to make the Extension of Time Order, Mitsui instituted a further proceeding, Action No WAD 203 of 2007, to seek the Extension of Time Order.
By consent on 25 October 2007, orders were made, to the effect that ground 1(a) in Hanwha's Statement be decided as a preliminary issue to be heard at the same time as the applicant's Originating Process in Action No WAD 203 of 2007.
PRELIMINARY ISSUE 
 
17 Accordingly, the preliminary issue for determination by the Court is whether on the proper construction and application of s 664C(1)(a), the Notice sets out a 'cash sum' for which Mitsui, as 90% Holder, proposes to acquire Hanwha's ordinary shares in SAH.
18 If the preliminary issue is decided in favour of Mitsui, it will proceed under s 664F of the Act to seek approval from the Court of its acquisition of the ordinary (and A class) shares of SAH held by Hanwha and Sempurna.
19 If the preliminary issue is decided against Mitsui, it cannot, without further order of the Court, seek to compulsorily acquire the ordinary shares, as the 6 month period for issuing a notice of compulsory acquisition has ended.
In this event, it will be necessary to determine Mitsui's application, in Action No WAD 203 of 2007 for the Extension of Time Order.
