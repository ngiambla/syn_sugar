 
1 On 23 February 2005 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer made an order directing the applicant, Marie Madeline Wight, to dispose of her interest in the land at 481 Esplanade, Grange, in the State of South Australia ('the property') by midnight (Canberra time) on 31 May 2005 to any person or persons approved in writing by the Treasurer.
The order, which I will call 'the divestiture order', was made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer under s 21A(4) of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Act').
2 Ms Wight has not complied with the divestiture order.
She claims that it is invalid and in her application to this Court she seeks a declaration and orders in the nature of certiorari and mandamus.
She also claims that a section in the Act is invalid because it is beyond the power of the Federal Parliament.
She seeks to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Court under s 39B(1)(1A)(b) and (c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and ss 21 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
The Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine the applicant's claim is not in issue.
3 The respondent to the proceedings is the Honourable Chris Pearce MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.
It is common ground that insofar as the Act refers to the Treasurer that includes a reference to the respondent because the respondent was acting for or on behalf of the Treasurer ( Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) s 19).
In these reasons I will need to refer from time to time to correspondence written to and by officers in the Department of the Treasury.
For convenience, I will refer to it as correspondence to and from the Treasurer.
4 The respondent has filed a defence and cross-claim.
In the cross-claim the respondent seeks an order that the applicant dispose of her interest in the property to a person or persons who are Australian citizens and who are not associates of the applicant, as that term is defined in the Act.
Neither party submitted that this Court did not have jurisdiction to make such an order.
The applicant submitted that, assuming it was otherwise appropriate to make an order under s 35 , the particular order sought by the respondent is not appropriate having regard to the provisions of the Act.
For reasons I will give, the order made by the respondent on 23 February 2005 is invalid.
In those circumstances, the cross-claim must be dismissed.
5 The applicant is not an Australian citizen.
She is a citizen of the Swiss Confederation.
The applicant is a gynaecologist and obstetrician.
In 1987 she married Dr Niels-Peter Buchholz and in 1994 she came to Australia and, in particular, South Australia, with Dr Buchholz.
There are five children of the marriage between the applicant and Dr Buchholz, three of whom reside in Australia.
In early 1995 the applicant and Dr Buchholz purchased the property as joint tenants.
There is a substantial family home on the property and the applicant claims to have lived on the property for all or most of the period from 1995 to the present.
6 The marriage between the applicant and Dr Buchholz failed and in April 1997 Dr Buchholz left Australia.
There were protracted proceedings in the Family Court of Australia between Dr Buchholz and the applicant.
It is not necessary to set out all the details.
On 27 April 2001 the Honourable Justice Murray made orders as to the distribution of property between the parties, including an order that Dr Buchholz transfer his interest in the property to the applicant.
Dr Buchholz appealed against those orders and although he achieved a measure of success on the appeal, the order that he transfer his interest in the property to the applicant was not altered.
On 30 July 2004 the applicant became the sole registered proprietor of the property.
The applicant has since remarried.
Her current husband is Mr Ronald Moster Wight and he is an Australian citizen.
7 The divestiture order made by the respondent was made on 23 February 2005.
On that day the respondent signed a notice in the following form:
 ' COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
 Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 
 ORDER UNDER SUBSECTION 21A(4) 
 WHEREAS --- 
 
 
 (A) Marie Madeline Wight is a foreign person for the purposes of section 21A of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 ("the Act"); 
 (B) Marie Madeline Wight has acquired an interest in the Australian urban land described in the Schedule ("the Land"); 
 
 
 NOW THEREFORE I, Chris Pearce, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, for and on behalf of the Treasurer, pursuant to subsection 21A(4) of the Act , being satisfied that the acquisition by Marie Madeline Wight of the interest in the Land is contrary to the national interest, direct Marie Madeline Wight to dispose of the interest in the Land by midnight (Canberra time) 31 May 2005 to any person or persons approved in writing by the Treasurer.

 This order comes into operation on the day that is 30 days after it is published in the Gazette.

 Dated this 23 rd day of February 2005 
 (signature) 
 Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer 
 
 SCHEDULE 
 Land known as 481 Esplanade, Grange, in the State of South Australia, being the land comprised in File Plan 42, Allotment 6, Hundred: Yatala; Subdivision: Grange.
' 
 

That notice was served on the applicant on 24 February 2005.
8 Prior to making the divestiture order the respondent was given a minute dated 18 February 2005 from a Mr Chris Legg, who at that time was the general manager of the Foreign Investment Policy Division.
The minute is a three-page document and it incorporated a further sheet entitled 'Additional Information'.
I will refer to the four pages as 'the minute'.
The minute is what the respondent had before him, and all he had before him, when making the divestiture order.
