 (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT) 
 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court ( Goo v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 1157).
It involves the vexed and difficult area of law introduced in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) by s 359A and its cognate provision s 424A as to what information was given by an applicant for review to the tribunal charged with the review of the administrative decision made by the Minister or his or her delegate.
2 In this case the decision-maker was the Migration Review Tribunal and the provisions of Pt 5 of Div 5 of the Act govern the manner in which it arrived at its decision.
3 Mr Goo applied for a subclass 457 visa by seeking to come within the category in cl 457.223(8) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth).
That created a class of visa, styled 'service seller', which had the following criteria:
 
 'Service sellers 
 
 (8) The applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 (a) the applicant: 
 
 
 (i) is a representative of a supplier of services who is located outside Australia; and 
 
 (ii) proposes to represent the supplier in Australia; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the representation involves negotiating, or entering into agreements, for the sale of services but does not involve the actual supply, or direct sale, of the services; and 
 
 (c) the Minister is satisfied that the proposal has not been made only for the purposes of securing the entry of the applicant to Australia.

4 Mr Goo is a national of Korea and had a business relationship with a Korean manufacturing company called Dongsung Precision Industrial Co Limited.
He came to Australia in December 2000 with his wife and son, each of whom was, in effect, included as his dependants on the visa application.
Mr Goo registered a business name, DSP Australia, of which he was the sole proprietor.
Dongsung was involved in the production of equipment.
Mr Goo sought to bring himself within the service seller visa requirements by establishing that he was a representative of Dongsung in Australia.
He proposed to represent it here.
He claimed that his activities here would involve negotiating or entering into agreements for the sale of Dongsung's services but would not themselves involve the actual supply or direct sale of those services.
5 After a delegate of the Minister refused his application he sought review of that decision in the Tribunal.
The Tribunal had the Department's file before it and in the course of its reasons set out at some length what material Mr Goo had put before the delegate in support of his initial application, even though Mr Goo had not, himself, put that very material to the Tribunal.
6 One of the items which the tribunal recorded as having been put to the delegate in support of the original application was a print out (created on 4 September 2002) of the website of DSP and which identified Mr Goo as the production manager.
It gave an address of DSP in Granville, New South Wales.
Another item that was before the delegate and referred to by the Tribunal as such was a pithy sole agency agreement dated 10 April 2002 between Dongsung and DSP.
Neither of those two documents was given by Mr Goo to the Tribunal for the purpose of his application within the meaning of s 359A(4)(b) as interpreted by the authorities culminating in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214.
So much is common ground.
7 Mr Goo's then migration agent wrote to the tribunal on 2 May 2005 enclosing, among other things, a service seller agreement dated 26 August 2003 between Dongsung and Mr Goo.
Among other things, that contained an entire agreement clause specifically providing for contents of the service seller agreement to supersede any and all prior agreements or understandings between those parties.
Also included in the material supplied with the letter of 2 May 2005 to the tribunal was another copy of the printout of the DSP website created on 2 May 2005 which again showed Mr Goo as the production manager.
That printout gave an address for DSP's business at Riverstone in New South Wales.
8 It is clear that the printout of the website before the delegate was of a different document and it contained different information from that which was provided to the Tribunal by Mr Goo in the letter of 2 May 2005.
This distinction, if it had a difference, is said to be critical to the outcome of the appeal.
9 The Tribunal's findings and reasons section of its decision set out, among other things, what had been put by Mr Goo to the delegate in support of his visa application and which was not provided to the Tribunal by Mr Goo for the purposes of the review.
It also set out the material put to the tribunal by Mr Goo including, as I have said, the letter of 2 May 2005 which was described by the Tribunal as follows:
 
 
 '20.
A submission dated 2 May 2005 indicated that [DSP] assisted in performing negotiations for the sale of services, entered into agreements, after sales services and routine maintenance on behalf of [Dongsung].
' 
 
 

10 The critical part of the Tribunal's reasons is contained in the following paragraphs:
 
 
 '22.
At the hearing the visa applicant stated amongst other things that he managed the business DSP Australia.
Products were shipped from Korea to the business which did further work on, and checked, the products and then the business sold the products.
The visa applicant stated that he received his income from the Korean company: that company had shipped equipment to Australia and DSP Australia sold the products and he received his income from the sales.

 
 23.
Available evidence shows that the visa applicant has set up a business called DSP Australia in Sydney.
The visa applicant has been described as a Production Manager for that business.
The business takes orders in Australia, products from Korea are shipped to DSP Australia which does further work or tests on them in a factory, and then sells them to Australian businesses.
The visa applicant takes his income from DSP Australia.
The Tribunal finds that the visa applicant is involved in the actual supply, or direct sale, of the services.

 
 24.
After considering the legislation, policy considerations and available evidence, the Tribunal finds that the visa applicant does not satisfy clause 457.223(8)(b): 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the representation involves negotiating, or entering into agreements, for the sale of services but does not involve the actual supply, or direct sale, of the services; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 25.
Given the findings made above, the Tribunal has no alternative but to affirm the decisions under review.
