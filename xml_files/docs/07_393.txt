 (REVISED FROM TRANSCRIPT) 
 
1 The Australian Financial Markets Association (AFMA) seeks leave to intervene in these proceedings under O 6, r 17 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).
That rule requires the Court to have regard to the matters in O 6, r 17(2).
These are:
 
 
 (a) whether the intervener's contribution will be "useful and different" from the parties; 
 (b) whether the intervention might unreasonably interfere with the ability of the parties to conduct the proceedings as they wish; and
 (c) any other matter the Court considers relevant.

 

2 If those criteria are made out, the Court has discretion to give leave to intervene on appropriate terms: see Wilson v Manna Hill Mining Co Pty Ltd (2004) 51 ASCR 404 at [104].
The basis upon which AFMA wishes to intervene is quite limited.
