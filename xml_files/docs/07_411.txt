 BAYER CROPSCIENCE GMBH 
 Second Applicant/Second Cross-Respondent AND: DELTAPINE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD 
 Respondent/Cross-Claimant 

 JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 15 MARCH 2007 PLACE: MELBOURNE 

 REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
 
1 The applicant/cross-respondent Bayer Bioscience NV (Bayer) is the patentee of Australian Patent No 623530 (the Patent).
It has brought infringement proceedings against the respondent/cross-claimant Deltapine Australia Pty Ltd (Deltapine).
By notice of motion filed on 9 March 2007 Deltapine seeks leave to amend its defence and cross-claim by raising an allegation of invalidity based on the contention that the true inventor was Dr Christina Hofmann.
2 The invention the subject of the Patent relates to plant cells and plants, the genomes of which are transformed to contain at least two genes, each coding for a different non-competitively binding bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal crystal protein (ICP) for a specific target insect species.
3 In the particulars to par 9 of the draft further amended particulars of invalidity exhibited to an affidavit in support of the motion it is said that Dr Hofmann undertook research in this area between 1983-1989, and then in 1987 she spent some time working at the laboratories of a predecessor in title to Bayer.
While at that firm, Dr Hofmann worked "with a number of researchers, including some of the alleged inventors", and that "as a result of the research and/or while working at that firm either alone or with the alleged inventors, Dr Hofmann developed and disclosed all or part of the alleged invention claimed in the patent".
Deltapine seeks to reserve the right to rely on further particulars.
4 The onus is on Deltapine to make out a case that the Court should exercise its discretion in its favour.
