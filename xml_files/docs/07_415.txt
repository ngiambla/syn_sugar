 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 The applicants appeal to the Court on questions of law from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal").
2 The applicants headed their notice of appeal as if they were joint "applicants", but in fact there were two proceedings before the Tribunal: one being proceeding NT 289 of 2002 in which G Cassegrain  Co Pty Ltd (administrator appointed) ("GCC") was the applicant, and the other being proceeding NT 290 of 2002 in which its wholly owned subsidiary, Clos Farming Estates Pty Limited ("CFE"), was the applicant.
Each applied for review of an objection decision of the respondent ("the Commissioner").
The Tribunal affirmed both objection decisions.
GCC and CFE should have commenced separate proceedings in this Court as they had done in the Tribunal.
A fortiori , the applicants' error should not have been compounded by a failure to distinguish between them as independent applicants in the title of the notice of appeal.
I have remedied the latter error above.
3 On 27 September 1993, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ("CSIRO") paid $9.5 million ("the Settlement Sum") as part of a settlement described below.
GCC disclosed $5.25 million of this amount as assessable income in its return for the year ended 30 June 1994.
By an amended assessment for that year, the Commissioner included the balance of $4.25 million in the assessable income of GCC.
The difference between GCC's taxable income for 1994 as assessed in the amended assessment and as returned was $3,186,712.
4 The central question before the Tribunal was whether GCC showed that its amended assessment for 1994 was excessive by this amount of $4.25 million or by some other amount.
5 The Commissioner's inclusion of the sum of $4.25 million resulted in a taxable income of GCC of $3,186,712 for the 1994 year.
Due to consequential adjustments to GCC's accumulated losses, an amended assessment was also made for the income year ended 30 June 1996, increasing GCC's taxable income for that year by $404,494.
6 On the basis of its income as returned, GCC transferred to CFE tax losses to the extent of $194,987.
However, a consequence of the inclusion of the sum of $4.25 million in the assessable income of GCC for 1994 was that its pre-1994 tax losses were fully absorbed, and there were no losses available for transfer.
In consequence, CFE's amended taxable income for 1994 became $194,987 instead of nil as returned.
7 For the 1995 income year, GCC returned a net current year loss of $569,012.
In reliance on that loss and on pre-1994 tax losses which it claimed to have carried forward, it claimed to transfer tax losses of $933,950 to CFE.
However, in accordance with the amended assessments, GCC was entitled to transfer, and CFE to receive a transfer of, only GCC's current year's loss of $569,012 --- a reduction in the amount of loss available to be transferred of $364,938.
The difference between CFE's 1995 taxable income for 1995 as returned and as assessed was $364,938.
8 For the 1996 income year, GCC returned a net current year income of $404,494.
It claimed to set off an equal amount of prior year tax losses, and returned a taxable income of nil.
However, as assessed by the Commissioner, GCC had no available prior year tax losses, and its taxable income for the 1996 tax year was $404,494.
9 The Commissioner treated letters from Claude Cassegrain dated 7 December 2000 and 22 August 2001 as an objection to the amended assessments issued to GCC (for 1994 and 1996) and to CFE (for 1994 and 1995).
10 The Commissioner notified his disallowance of the objections by notice dated 7 November 2002.
11 On 20 December 2002, GCC and CFE each applied to the Tribunal for review of the Commissioner's objection decision relating to it.
12 The issue is whether the sum of $4.25 million was part of the assessable income of GCC for the year ended 30 June 1994 by reason of the capital gains provisions of Pt IIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ("the Act ").
It was common ground that the sum of $9.5 million was not income in character.

 BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
 13 The following outline of the background facts is based on the Tribunal's statement of its reasons for decision.
14 In about May 1987, representatives of GCC and CSIRO began discussions on the possible application of a soil improvement technology that CSIRO was developing, known as "slotting", to land on which GCC proposed to develop vineyards.
On or about 10 July 1987, CSIRO and GCC entered into a written agreement for the conduct of research and development concerning slotting and associated activities.
15 Soon afterwards, a joint venture company called Cassiro Pty Limited ("Cassiro") was formed.
16 Later, there was a falling out between GCC and CSIRO.
On 8 April 1992, GCC commenced proceeding NG 3062 of 1992 in this Court against CSIRO, its wholly owned subsidiary, Sirotech Limited ("Sirotech"), and Cassiro.
In that proceeding, GCC made a range of claims against CSIRO and ancillary claims against Sirotech.
17 On 7 May 1992, CSIRO commenced proceeding NG 3095 of 2002 in this Court seeking to have GCC wound up on the just and equitable ground.
18 GCC alleged in its amended statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal that, by April 1993, the legal advisers of GCC and Claude Cassegrain were considering amending the pleadings in proceeding NG 3062 of 1992 to include "claims for tort and exemplary damages for the damage caused by the CSIRO parties to the reputation of Mr Cassegrain", but in his statement of facts issues and contentions before the Tribunal, the Commissioner disputed that consideration was being given to including a claim for damage to the reputation of Mr Cassegrain.
19 The two proceedings were heard together before Olney J commencing in early 1993.
20 On 26 April 1993 at the chambers of Mr RV Gyles QC (as his Honour then was), senior counsel for GCC, there was a meeting attended by Mr Gyles, Claude Cassegrain, Professor Adrienne Clarke, the then chairperson of CSIRO, Mr Shears, also of CSIRO, and Mr TF Bathurst QC, senior counsel for CSIRO and Sirotech.
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss settlement of the proceedings.
21 Prior to a mediation referred to below, Claude Cassegrain did not join in or apply to join in as a party to GCC's proceeding, and he did not institute any separate proceeding against either of them for damages for defamation.
However, in a letter dated 5 May 1993 that he wrote as company secretary of GCC to Professor Clarke ("the Cassegrain Letter"), he set out details of GCC's claim "from a practical rather than legal viewpoint", and included an item reading as follows:
 "5.
Damage to the name, reputation and standing of GC  Co, Cassegrain Family name, Cassegrain Group of companies, and Claude Cassegrain and his family as a result of being publicly associated with a failed venture involving bitter litigation and disruption to the family and their associated companies' business activities --- $5,000,000".
(my emphasis)
 

The total amount claimed in the Cassegrain letter was $56,033,000.
The concluding sentence in the letter was: "It is always understood that any settlement would involve some adequate means to restore the reputation of the family, the company and myself personally".
No such "adequate means" was referred to in the letter or subsequently.
Contrary to the applicants' written submissions, the Cassegrain Letter did not threaten that Claude Cassegrain, his family and their companies would sue CSIRO for defamation and injurious falsehood, unless such a threat is to be read into the passage from the letter set out above.

 22 On 18 May 1993, CSIRO made a written settlement offer.
It proposed mediation.
23 On 2 June 1993, CSIRO's solicitors, Blake Dawson Waldron ("Blakes"), informed GCC's solicitors, Garrett  Walmsley, that the mediation should be conducted on the basis that CSIRO had a liability to GCC.
CSIRO insisted that Claude Cassegrain be a party to any settlement.
24 On 16 June 1993, Blakes wrote to John Garrett of Garrett  Walmsley offering to settle on the basis of a payment to GCC of $7.25 million, subject to CSIRO's obtaining Ministerial approval.
That amount was said to represent $4.32 million in respect of damages claimed by GCC in proceeding NG 3062 of 1992, $2 million for costs, and $930,000 for transfers to CSIRO of GCC's interests in certain technologies.
For its part, CSIRO was to transfer its shares in Cassiro to GCC, and GCC was to use its best endeavours to procure that Cassiro would covenant that neither GCC nor Cassiro would conduct any future business activities in such a way as to represent that there was any connection between the business of Cassiro or GCC, and CSIRO.
GCC was to transfer any intellectual property and other rights connected with the soil slotting technology to CSIRO or its nominee.
Blakes's letter stated that GCC and its relevant associates (including Claude Cassegrain) and Cassiro were to grant comprehensive releases and indemnities to CSIRO and Sirotech, and that CSIRO and Sirotech were to grant similar releases and indemnities to GCC.
25 On 29 June 1993 Garrett  Walmsley wrote to Blakes advising that they were instructed to seek leave to amend in proceeding NG 3062 of 1992 to include:
 "counts in defamation and injurious falsehood in relation to communications between servants and agents of CSIRO and Sirotech on the one hand and the State Bank of NSW on the other".

 

The State Bank of New South Wales ("the Bank") had financed GCC and held a mortgage debenture registered as a charge over its assets.

 26 In fact, in June 1993 a second further amended statement of claim was settled by counsel.
It was never filed and no copy of it was given to CSIRO because the legal advisers of GCC took the view that it would be disruptive of negotiations and of the then forthcoming mediation, for a copy to be handed over at that time.
The draft second further amended statement of claim pleaded causes of action in conspiracy to cheat and to defraud, abuse of process, and defamation and injurious falsehood.
The defamation and injurious falsehood claims were based on letters that Dr Stocker of CSIRO had written to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce concerning the conduct of GCC, and, in particular, its driving force, Claude Cassegrain.
However, there was no suggestion of an application to amend to introduce Claude Cassegrain as an additional applicant, and the only allegation was that GCC had suffered loss and damage from the tortious conduct of CSIRO and/or Sirotech.
27 It will be noted that Garrett  Walmsley's letter of 29 June 1993 to Blakes did not suggest any proposal to introduce Mr Cassegrain as a second applicant or otherwise suggest that the threatened claims of defamation and injurious falsehood were his, as distinct from GCC's.
28 A mediation before Sir Lawrence Street was held over three days from 28 June to 2 July 1993.
The parties agreed on a settlement in principle with CSIRO paying $9.5 million, and both proceedings were adjourned.
29 On Friday 2 July 1993, Sir Lawrence Street recorded in a memorandum that he had chaired lengthy mediation discussions that had resulted in an offer of $9.5 million by CSIRO to GCC.
He expressed the opinion that the proposal settlement agreement was a "soundly based commercial compromise of the dispute".
30 On Saturday 3 July 1993, there was a discussion between Claude Cassegrain, his parents, Gerard Cassegrain and Franoise Cassegrain, and GCC's solicitor, Andrew Walmsley.
Claude and Gerard Cassegrain agreed on an apportionment of the sum of $9.5 million, as to $5.2 million to GCC and as to $4.25 million to Claude Cassegrain ("the Apportionment Agreement").
Franoise Cassegrain was a passive bystander, although Claude Cassegrain observed in cross-examination that she could have objected if she had wanted to do so.
31 On 6 July 1993, a letter was written on the letterhead of GCC to John Garrett of Garrett  Walmsley.
The letter was apparently signed by Gerard Cassegrain and his son Patrick Cassegrain.
Neither of them was a director of GCC, although each was a shareholder (see below at [33]).
