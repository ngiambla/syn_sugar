 
1 This is an appeal from the decision of Smith FM dated 21 September 2006, dismissing an application under s 476 Migration Act 1958 (Cth) seeking judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal").
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent dated 18 May 2004 wherein the delegate refused the grant of a protection visa to the appellant.
2 At the hearing of this appeal I indicated that I would order that the first respondent's name be amended to "Minister for Immigration and Citizenship", and that the Refugee Review Tribunal be added as a second respondent to these proceedings.
Background 
 
3 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.
He arrived in Australia on 15 February 2004 and applied for a protection visa on 18 March 2004.
The appellant claimed to have well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his membership of the Bangladesh Awami League.
The appellant claimed that he came to the attention of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) as a student activist in 2001.
His claims indicated he suffered assaults and economic penalties by BNP thugs and that a number of false charges had been filed against him since he had left Bangladesh.
4 On 8 June 2004, the appellant made an application to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
The Tribunal at that time ("first Tribunal") affirmed the delegate's decision of 18 May 2004.
On 14 November 2005 in the Federal Magistrates Court, that decision was remitted by consent to the Tribunal, differently constituted, for reconsideration.
It is the second Tribunal decision that is now on appeal before me.
The Tribunal's decision 
 
5 The Tribunal considered the appellant's evidence given to the first Tribunal on 1 November 2004.
It had regard to the audio tape of the first hearing and summarised the key points of his oral evidence.
The Tribunal then considered the oral evidence provided at the hearing before it and the documentary evidence provided by the appellant.
6 The Tribunal in its decision noted that the appellant referred to being mentally disturbed at both hearings, but that the appellant did not provide any medical advice to indicate that he had any form of psychological impairment, nor did it appear that he had sought medical attention.
The Tribunal was satisfied from its observations that the appellant was competent to give evidence.
The appellant had said on several occasions that he did not want to talk about the past and claimed that he could not recall the chronology and details of his claims.
The Tribunal did not draw adverse conclusions from minor discrepancies regarding dates but it was not satisfied that the appellant's reticence was attributable to any medical condition.
Rather, the Tribunal found it was an attempt to deflect the Tribunal's scrutiny of his claims.
7 The Tribunal found the appellant was a witness of low credibility on a range of matters; it noted the appellant made assertions which on closer examination proved to be misleading, incomplete or internally inconsistent.
8 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant was an Awami League participant, but viewed with scepticism the appellant's claims that he held a number of portfolios and responsibilities in the party.
