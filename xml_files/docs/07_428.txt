 
1 This is an appeal from the decision of Emmett FM of 13 September 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") dated 23 May 2005.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.
2 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who arrived in Australia on 30 July 2004 after having travelled through the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.
On 2 August 2004 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
On 10 November 2004 a delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa.
On 7 December 2004 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.
On 28 January 2005 the appellant was advised through his authorised recipient that the Tribunal was unable to make a decision in the appellants favour on the information before it.
The appellant attended a hearing before the Tribunal and submitted various documents including a charge sheet in support of his claims.
He later also submitted letters from political figures in Bangladesh to the Tribunal.
3 The appellant appeared before the Tribunal to give oral evidence, assisted by an interpreter and a migration agent.
He claimed to have been a worker of the Awami League, and that because of his financial and social position he was a "high profile political figure".
He said that he had also been involved in "huge social welfare activities", and as a result his rivals had planned to harm both him and his political career.
In particular, he said he feared that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ("BNP") and its youth wing might kill him; that false charges had been laid against him, that he feared government agencies were involved, and that he feared the government and the agencies were ignoring "court rules".
The appellant produced a number of documents to the Tribunal, including letters, memoranda and reports.
He claimed that he had played a significant part in elections at Joypara College, and that he had become a Vice-President of the Jubo League, the youth wing of the Awami League, in Dohar Upavila in 2000.
The appellant claimed that he had managed to obtain his passport with this assistance of a broker despite being on the run in Bangladesh.
He also said that he had not applied for asylum in the Philippines because he had heard from friends that Australia was a good place for refugee status and he had been bound for Australia.
4 The Tribunal noted that the appellant had produced a number of documents in support of his application, and put to the appellant that many police documents submitted by applicants for asylum were forgeries.
The appellant said that his documents were genuine.
The Tribunal allowed the appellant additional time to produce further evidence and make written submissions, during which time the appellant produced a number of letters purporting to be from Awami League figures.
