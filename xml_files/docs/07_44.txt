 
1 The applicants (collectively 'Bodum') sought the Court's consent to the surrender of two designs (Australian Design Nos.
123181 and 129239) ('the designs') registered in the name of the third applicant.
That consent was required by s 50(4) of the Designs Act 2003 (Cth) ('the Act').
The Court gave its consent on 2 May 2006 without opposition from the respondent ('Housewares').
At issue are the costs incurred in these proceedings in relation to the designs.
Housewares submits that its costs of Bodum's motion for the Court's consent and its cross-claim for rectification of the Register of Designs should be paid by Bodum on an indemnity basis.
Bodum submits that each party should pay its own costs.
2 Three issues arise:
 
 
 (1) Is Bodum liable to pay Housewares' costs?
(2) Are costs payable on an indemnity basis?
(3) Are costs payable from the filing of the cross-claim until Bodum's approach to the Court?

 

3 It is necessary to set out the procedural history of this matter with respect to the designs in some detail.
The initial threat of design infringement and the pleadings 
 
4 The first design (Australian Design No.
123181) claims a monopoly in the shape and configuration of ' a set of articles comprising a coffee maker and drinking vessel '.
That design was registered on 13 April 1995 and claims priority as at 16 March 1994.
The second design (Australian Design No.
129239) was registered on 21 February 1997 and claims priority as at 5 January 1995.
It claims a monopoly in the shape and configuration of a bowl.
5 Bodum and Housewares each sell coffee plungers and related household products in Australia.
One such product, manufactured and distributed by Bodum, is a coffee plunger called the "Bodum Chambord Coffee Plunger" ('the Chambord plunger').
On 20 August 2004, Bodum's solicitors wrote to Housewares and demanded that Housewares cease importing and selling three products alleged to be ' direct copies ' of the Chambord plunger in Australia.
The importation and sale of those products was said to constitute an infringement of the first design and give rise to causes of action for trade mark infringement, contravention of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and passing off.
No reference was made to the second design.
6 Housewares responded by its solicitors on 1 October 2004.
Relevantly, Housewares' response alleged that coffee plungers of the same shape and configuration as the first design had been available for sale in Australia well before the priority date of that design.
The letter stated that Housewares would apply to the Court for an order ' revoking the registration ' if Bodum proceeded with an action for design infringement.
7 Bodum's solicitors proceeded to draft pleadings and in so doing received further instructions.
Relevantly, those instructions were that the first design did not, in fact, relate to the shape and configuration of the Chambord plunger.
It related to a different plunger instead.
That fact was relayed by Bodum's solicitors to Housewares' solicitors in a "without prejudice" letter on 4 April 2005.
The letter stated '[t] herefore, if litigation becomes necessary, the case will proceed based on infringement of Australian Registered Trade Mark No.
659903, breaches of sections 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act and passing off only ' (my emphasis).
Bodum now seeks to rely on the relevant passages of that letter and waives any privilege attaching to those passages.
8 Housewares' responded by reserving its right to apply for an order revoking the first design on 12 April 2005.
Its solicitors stated in their response '[w] e assume that your client is not proceeding with the previously threatened design infringement claim because your client understands that your client, in 1995, had no basis upon which to seek to register the design '.
A reply "without prejudice" letter was sent by Bodum's solicitors to Housewares' solicitors on 20 April 2005.
The reply stated that ' it is not the case that our client is no longer proceeding with a design infringement claim against [Housewares] because there was no basis for the design's initial registration '.
It also elaborated upon the explanation earlier given by Bodum's solicitors that the first design in fact related to a different coffee plunger.
That plunger was said to incorporate a plastic (rather than metal) frame and had been discontinued.
Bodum also seeks to rely on the relevant passages of the letter of 20 April 2005 and waives privilege attaching to those passages.
9 These proceedings were issued by Bodum on the following day.
By its application and statement of claim, Bodum alleged trade mark infringement, passing off and contraventions of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act in respect of coffee plungers and related products distributed and sold by Housewares.
Those products allegedly incorporate features of Bodum products, including the Chambord plunger.
An amended statement of claim was filed by Bodum on 31 May 2005.
Allegations of passing off and contraventions of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act in respect of other products distributed by Housewares were included.
No claim for infringement was made in respect of the first or second designs.
10 Pursuant to s 39(1) of the Designs Act 1906 (Cth) ('the old Act'), a ' person aggrieved ' by an entry wrongly made or remaining in the Register of Designs may apply to the Court for an order to rectify the Register.
Housewares' filed a cross-claim on 28 June 2005 pursuant to that section relevantly seeking an order to expunge the first and second designs.
Orders for rectification were sought under the old Act as the designs were registered before the commencement of the Act (s 151(3) of the Act).
The basis for expungement was an allegation that the first and second designs were not new or original in Australia at their priority date.
Bodum filed its defence to the cross-claim on 15 July 2005.
Bodum denied that Housewares was a "person aggrieved" and entitled to bring the cross-claim.
The offers of compromise 
 
11 Three offers of compromise were made by the parties pursuant to O 23 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') after the filing of Bodum's defence to the cross-claim.
Each offer was made without prejudice save as to costs.
12 First, under cover of separate letters dated 12 September 2005 in respect of the first and second designs, Housewares offered to discontinue its cross-claim for rectification of the Register on the condition that Bodum release Housewares and others (including purchasers of Housewares' products) from any claim for infringement of the designs.
According to the terms of offer, Housewares' costs of the cross-claim would be payable by Bodum.
The covering letters acknowledged that no infringement of the second design had ever been claimed by Bodum.
Nevertheless, Housewares asserted it was a "person aggrieved" by the second design because sugar bowls the subject of allegations made in the amended statement of claim possessed the same shape and configuration as was covered by the monopoly of the second design.
Housewares also asserted, in relation to the first design: 
 
 'the case law clearly establishes that a person does not need to be the subject of any infringement allegation to be a person aggrieved... [Housewares] does not need to rely on these [cases] , however, as Bodum have not released [Housewares] from the claim of design infringement made in your letter dated 20 August 2004.
Moreover, our client cannot leave its customers exposed to similar threats.
' 
 

 13 Secondly, under cover of separate letters dated 29 September 2005 in respect of each design, Bodum proposed its own offers of compromise.
According to the terms of that offer, Bodum would voluntarily surrender the designs in return for Housewares discontinuing the cross-claim.
Each party was to pay its own costs.
No release was included in the offer.
Bodum's solicitors explained in the letters '[o] ur clients are of the opinion that [Housewares ' ] offer does not involve any real element of compromise on your client's behalf.
Acceptance of the offer would mean that [the first or second design] could never be enforced against [Housewares] , and Bodum would be required to pay your client's costs in circumstances where it did not claim infringement' of the first design and ' neither threatened nor claimed infringement ' of the second design.
14 A third offer of compromise was proposed by Housewares on 11 October 2005.
That offer was in substantially identical terms to Bodum's offer, save for the fact that Housewares' costs of the cross-claim were to be payable by Bodum and each party was to give written consent to the surrender of the designs.
That offer was rejected by Bodum by its solicitors on 25 October 2005.
Bodum's solicitors maintained the position that Housewares' was not a "person aggrieved" and denied that the terms proposed by Housewares represented a genuine offer of compromise in circumstances where there was no waiver by Housewares of its entitlement to costs.
The media release and motion for surrender 
 
15 On 10 October 2005, after the second offer of compromise but prior to the third, Bodum issued a press release titled ' AUSTRALIA USED AS A DUMPING GROUND FOR CAF COPIES ' ('the media release').
The media release identified Housewares as one of two companies targeted by Bodum in legal proceedings in this Court as part of ' an extension of [Bodum's] worldwide crackdown on pirate copies of its designs '.
The media release further stated '[t] he companies who are behind the copying and manufacturing of pirated designs...target Australia and New Zealand '.
Specific reference was made to ' design infringement ' and the fact that the second applicant ' would not tolerate importers or manufacturers pinching the innovative Bodum designs nor trading off the Bodum reputation '.
16 Not surprisingly, the media release resulted in a flurry of correspondence between the parties' solicitors.
Of particular relevance for present purposes is an open letter sent by Bodum's solicitors to Housewares' solicitors on 28 November 2005 seeking to ' clarify ' the media release so far as it referred to a claim or possible claim for design infringement.
According to that letter, no allegation of infringement by Housewares of any registered design owned by Bodum was ever intended to have been made by the media release.
The letter reiterated that Bodum had at no stage made any allegation of design infringement by its pleadings.
The letter also stated:
 
 'For the avoidance of any doubt, Bodum unequivocally withdraws any earlier allegation of infringement of [the first design] , in particular contained in [Bodum's letter of demand dated 20 August 2004] '.

 

17 Notwithstanding the unequivocal withdrawal of any allegation of infringement in respect of the first design, Housewares' solicitors served a notice to admit facts pursuant to O 18 r 2 of the Rules in respect of the visual features of shape and configuration applicable to the first and second designs and certain products the subject of these proceedings on 23 February 2006.
Bodum's solicitors replied on the following day by open letters stating that they had received instructions to surrender each design voluntarily in accordance with the procedure set out in s 50 of the Act.
By s 50(4) of the Act, Housewares' consent or the Court's consent to the surrender of the designs was required.
The letters proposed that, if consent from Housewares' were not forthcoming, a notice of motion seeking the Court's consent to the surrender of the designs would be filed.
18 Housewares' solicitors replied on 1 March 2006 and advised that Housewares was prepared to consent to the surrender of the designs on the condition that Bodum agree to pay its costs of the cross-claim for rectification on a party and party basis.
The letter complained that Bodum's further offer to surrender the designs was made, notwithstanding Housewares' previous offers of comprise, at a time when Housewares' evidence on the cross-claim was substantially complete.
Bodum rejected that offer on the same day in an open letter.
Its letter of rejection ' formally put [Housewares] on notice that it need not take any further steps in these proceedings relating to the [designs]' (my emphasis).
19 A notice disputing some, but not all, facts in respect of the shape and configuration applicable to the first and second designs and products the subject of these proceedings was served by Bodum under cover of a letter dated 9 March 2006.
That letter stated that a notice of motion seeking the Court's consent to the surrender of the designs was being prepared and that: 
 
 ' [w] e also note that by our letter dated 1 March 2006, [Bodum] put [Housewares] on notice that it need not take any further steps in this proceeding relating to [the designs] '.

 

20 Bodum filed its notice of motion seeking the Court's consent to the surrender of the designs on 22 March 2006.
The parties' submissions 
 Bodum 
 
21 Bodum submits that the parties should pay their own costs of the cross-claim for rectification and of Bodum's motion for the Court's consent.
In the event that Bodum is liable to pay any of Housewares' costs, it submits that those costs should be limited to costs incurred up to 29 September 2005.
That was the date when Bodum's offer of compromise was formally put to Housewares ([13] above).
