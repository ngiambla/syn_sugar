 1 By Notice of Motion filed 31 January 2007, BGC seeks to vary an access regime for certain discovered documents, asserted by ICAP to contain confidential and commercially sensitive information.
The access regime was established by consent orders made 4 July 2006 which provided for access to be granted to BGC's legal representatives and its expert witness, Mr Gower.
2 The documents have previously been supplied to those persons pursuant to confidentiality undertakings in accordance with the consent orders.
3 The Motion seeks access for Mr Webster, Mr Kent, Mr Mikolaitis and Mr Herbert, who are all respondents in the proceedings.
4 The Motion also seeks access for BGC's General Counsel, Mr Bartlett.
ICAP has now consented to access being granted to Mr Bartlett on the appropriate confidentiality undertakings
 
5 All of the documents to which access is sought for the nominated persons are said to be relevant to ICAP's damages claim.
The circumstances in which the claim arises were set out in my interlocutory judgment dated 18 February 2005; [2005] FCA 130.
6 In brief terms, on 17 January 2005, fourteen employees of ICAP resigned en masse from their employment.
They comprised the entire futures desk at ICAP's Sydney office.
I was satisfied, at an interlocutory level, that the evidence pointed strongly in favour of an inference that what took place was part of a coordinated plan to take business away from ICAP.
7 All of those employees entered into employment contracts with BGC and were indemnified by BGC against liability arising out of legal proceedings brought by ICAP.
8 Later in January 2005, four employees of ICAP's "swaps" desk, and one employee from its "bonds" desk, also walked out and joined BGC.
9 I was also satisfied that there is an arguable case that Mr Webster, who was at the time a director of ICAP, induced many of the employees to breach their contracts with ICAP.
It also appeared to me that Mr Kent, a senior ICAP employee, was involved in the recruitment of ICAP's employees.
10 The effect of what took place on 17 January 2005 and 28 January 2005 was that ICAP lost its entire futures desk as well as four members of its swaps desk.
They included Mr Mikolaitis who was head of the swaps desk, and Mr Herbert.
11 As I have already mentioned, the persons for whom access is now sought are Messrs Webster, Kent, Mikolaitis and Herbert.
BGC contends that without access being granted to these nominated persons, BGC cannot instruct its lawyers as to how the asserted facts upon which the damages claim rests can be challenged and answered.
12 The circumstances set out above make it plain that ICAP and BGC are bitter trade rivals.
ICAP asserts that the information to which BGC seeks access for the nominated persons is highly sensitive and confidential.
It relies on a well-established line of authorities that recognises that in these circumstances the Court has a discretion to mould an access regime which gives appropriate protection to the party whose confidential documents are at issue whilst enabling the other party such access as is necessary to properly conduct the litigation.
The legal principles 
 
13 The principles have been applied and explained in a large number of authorities.
They include Mobil Oil of Australia Ltd v Guina Developments Pty Ltd [1996] 2 VR 34, Macquarie Generation v Coal  Allied Industries Ltd [2001] FCA 1349 , C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1189 and Reebok v SOCOG [2000] NSWSC 295.
14 In Mobil Oil at 38, Hayne JA pointed out that ordinarily, the fact that documents are confidential is not a bar to inspection by the other party.
He said, however, that where the parties are trade rivals, different considerations arise.
15 What underlies Hayne JA's analysis is his statement that the principles of a trade rival cannot forget the secret information once it is revealed.
Thus, the value of the commercially sensitive information will be lost unless it is protected by an appropriate access regime.
The implied obligation not to use the documents other than for the purpose of the proceedings is thought to be insufficient, as between trade rivals, to permit unrestricted access.
16 The balancing exercise to which Hayne JA referred in Mobil Oil at 39-40 involves weighing the needs of a party to litigation against the "legitimate concern" of a trade rival.
17 The principal factors which inform the exercise of the discretion have been stated in the authorities.
A party to litigation is entitled to know the case it has to meet and to properly instruct solicitors and counsel.
The nature and content of the documents, the degree of confidentiality of the information and the risk that the rival will use it to the detriment of the other party are important factors to be weighed in the balance; Mobil Oil at 39-40; Reebok at [43]; Hadid v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 70 FCR 403 at 410-411.
The Competing Contentions 
 
18 BGC's position rests firmly on the proposition that it cannot adequately defend a claim for damages of at least $4 million unless the nominated persons are given access to the documents.
It submits that without such access it cannot instruct its lawyers as to how to challenge essential facts on which the claim is based.
Nor can it conduct the litigation or receive advice about it on a fully informed basis.
19 BGC puts forward the nominated persons as representatives with the requisite degree of knowledge and experience to look at the documents.
It relies on evidence, on information and belief that there are no other BGC employees with the appropriate experience, apart from persons to whom similar objection would be taken by ICAP.
20 ICAP points to the bitter rivalry between the parties, as is evidenced by the subject matter of the litigation.
It also relies upon the small number of participants in the relevant industry, namely inter-dealing broking in Sydney.
The evidence establishes that ICAP and BGC are two of only five competitors in that industry.
21 Mr Webster is the President of BGC in the Asia-Pacific region.
He appears to be responsible for recruiting staff and expanding BGC's business in Sydney.
He had similar responsibilities when he was employed by ICAP.
22 Mr Kent is BGC's Director of Business Development for Asia-Pacific and reports to Mr Webster.
He held a senior role at ICAP up to January 2005.
23 Mr Mikolaitis and Mr Herbert are both senior interest rate swaps brokers.
ICAP suggests, though in a very general way, that they would be involved in the recruitment of swaps brokers for BGC.
24 ICAP relies on evidence which establishes that the success and financial performance of both ICAP and BGC is dependent upon the performance of individual brokers.
Thus, each seeks to locate and identify people of talent within the available market.
25 There is evidence of continuing recruitment efforts by BGC.
In April 2006, BGC recruited three swaps brokers from one of the market participants.
Also, in December 2006, BGC appears to have made an unsuccessful approach to brokers employed by another competitor.
