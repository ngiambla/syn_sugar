 
1 This is an appeal from orders made by a Federal Magistrate.
The appellant applied for constitutional writs directed to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister") and the Migration Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") in relation to a decision of the Tribunal made on 9 May 2005.
The Magistrate made an order on 27 July 2006 dismissing the application.
2 The appellant submits that the Magistrate erred in concluding that the Tribunal had complied with s 359A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").
She submits that the Tribunal did not comply with that section and that the failure constituted a jurisdictional error.
The appellant also submits that the Magistrate erred in concluding that even if the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 359A , the relief sought by the appellant should nevertheless be refused in the exercise of his discretion.
The first respondent filed a notice of contention.
The Minister submits that the order of the Magistrate should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by the Magistrate.
The Minister submits that the Tribunal did not act in breach of s 359A of the Act because the section did not apply to the information in question because it was information the appellant gave for the purpose of the application within the terms of s 359A(4)(b).
The facts 
 
3 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China.
She is a student and is 24 years of age.
On 20 January 2000 she was granted a Student (Temporary) (class TU) visa, subclass 560.
She arrived in Australia on 5 March 2000.
Her first visa expired on 15 March 2003.
On 2 May 2003 the appellant was granted a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, subclass 573 which was due to expire on 15 March 2006 ('the student visa').
4 There were a number of conditions attached to the student visa including condition 8202.
That condition was in the following terms (see Migration Regulations 1994 Sch 8):
 
 
 (1) The holder (other than the holder of a Subclass 560 (Student) visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa) must meet the requirements of subclauses (2) and (3).

 
 
 (2) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 
 
 (a) the holder is enrolled in a registered course; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 or 571 (Schools Sector) visa who is a secondary exchange student -- the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.
(3) A holder meets the requirements of this subclause if:
 (a) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records -- the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: 
 
 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term and semester of the course; and 
 
 
 
 (b) in any case -- the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory: 
 
 
 
 (i) for a course that runs for less than a semester -- for the course; or 
 (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester -- for each term or semester (whichever is shorter) of the course.

 
 
 (4) In the case of the holder of a Subclass 560 visa who is an AusAID student or the holder of a Subclass 576 (AusAID or Defence Sector) visa -- the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study or training.

 

5 The appellant enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce course at Monash University ("the university") and she commenced that course on 3 March 2003.
She was due to complete the course on 31 December 2005.
6 The appellant did not make satisfactory academic progress during 2003.
She failed all four of her subjects in the first semester of 2003 and three of her four subjects in the second semester of 2003.
She was excluded by the Faculty of Business and Economics for unsatisfactory academic progress in the 2003 academic year.
The university gave a notice to the appellant pursuant to s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth) on 4 March 2004.
The notice stated, in part, as follows:
 
 This Notice is sent to you pursuant to section 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 as you have breached a condition of your student visa relating to satisfactory academic performance in the course in which you have been enrolled at this institution.
Particulars of breach: 
 Excluded by the Faculty of Business and Economics for unsatisfactory academic progress in the 2003 academic year --- breach of condition 8202.

 Pursuant to section 137J of the Migration Act 1958 , your student visa will cease on the 28 th day after the date of this notice and ends on the 28 th day thereafter.
(Original emphasis.
)
 

7 On 30 March 2004 the Minister's delegate gave the appellant a notice under s 116 of the Act of the Minister's intention to consider cancellation of the student visa.
Section 116 relevantly provides:
 
 
 (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that: 
 
 
 ...
 (b) its holder has not complied with a condition of the visa; or
 ... 
 
 
 (2) The Minister is not to cancel a visa if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa is not to be cancelled.
(3) If the Minister may cancel a visa under subsection (1), the Minister must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.

 

8 Circumstances have been prescribed in the Migration Regulations 1994 ("the Regulations ") for the purposes of s 116(3).
Regulation 2.43(2) as it was at the relevant time provided as follows:
 
 
 (2) For subsection 116(3) of the Act, the circumstances in which the Minister must cancel a visa are: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) each of the circumstances comprising the grounds set out in paragraphs (1) (a) and (b); and
 (b) in the case of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, that the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with: 
 
 
 
 (i) condition 8104 or 8105 (if the condition applies to the visa); or 
 
 
 
 (ii) condition 8202.

 
 
 
 

9 On 7 April 2004 a delegate of the Minister decided that there had been a breach of condition 8202 and concluded that the decision to cancel the student visa was mandatory.
The appellant's student visa was cancelled.
10 On 8 April 2004 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.
She was invited to attend a hearing of the Tribunal on 9 February 2005 and she attended with a representative.
After the hearing on 9 February 2005, the Tribunal sent the appellant a letter in purported compliance with s 359A of the Act.
The letter also sought information under s 359 of the Act, but that aspect is not relevant on this appeal.
The letter from the Tribunal contains the following passage:
 
 Section 359A of the Act states that the Tribunal must explain, and invite comment on, "particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review".
