The statutory power to issue a Part A competition notice lies in Pt XIB of the Act.
Part XIB is directed to '[t] he Telecommunications Industry: Anti-competitive conduct and record-keeping rules '.
Within that statutory framework, prior to the issue of the Competition Notice and pursuant to s 151AKA(10) of the Act, the Commission gave written notice to Telstra ('the Consultation Notice') of its proposal to issue a Part A competition notice.
Telstra also challenges the issue of the Consultation Notice.
Telstra asserts that the notices and the decisions to issue them lack validity and that it was denied procedural fairness.
2 The notices were issued in the context of certain action by Telstra in connection with charges for its wholesale and retail telephone line rental services and correspondence between Telstra and the Commission.
While the notices relate to asserted anti-competitive conduct, these proceedings are not to determine whether Telstra has engaged in anti-competitive conduct.
At issue is whether the Commission exercised its powers validly under the Act and accorded Telstra such procedural fairness and natural justice as the statutory context or (if applicable) the common law required.
BACKGROUND 
 
3 The underlying subject matter of these proceedings relates to the pricing of wholesale and retail line rental packages provided by Telstra .
Telstra sells access to its Public Switched Telecommunications Network ('PSTN') to its own retail customers and to wholesale customers who are themselves licensed carriers or carriage service providers.
Access to the PSTN is a "line rental" service which enables the customer to establish a link between it and the telephone exchange.
In practical terms, however, line rental by itself does not provide a functional telephone service.
It is necessary to acquire some further calling service in order to make use of the telephone.
The simplest form of residential package available from Telstra to retail customers is "HomeLine Part", which is a bundle of line rental with local call services only.
Customers who select the HomeLine Part plan may then pre-select the other telephony services (eg, national long distance, international and fixed-to-mobile calls) from any carrier, including carriers other than Telstra.
Telstra's wholesale customers, such as Optus, may provide such pre-selectable services as part of a package that they provide to their customers.
4 At the wholesale level, Telstra offers a stand-alone line rental service which is not bundled with other call services.
Telstra charges other carriers and carriage service providers per month for line rental services for on-sale to residential end users.
This wholesale service was and is known as "Home Access".
5 On 28 October 2005, Telstra informed the Commission of its intention to implement and from 5 December 2005 implemented a change to its wholesale Home Access plan, increasing the monthly price by $3.10 from $24.50 (excluding GST) to $27.60 (excluding GST) ('the Home Access increase').
The Home Access increase was announced to at least some wholesale customers on 2 November 2005.
Up to 30 November 2005 the Commission did not communicate to Telstra any relevant concerns held by it about the proposed increase.
6 On 1 December 2005, Telstra also increased the price of its HomeLine Part service, that is, the pre-selectable service it provides its retail customers, from $26.95 (including GST) to $31.95 (including GST) ('the HomeLine Part increase).
The Commission was informed of Telstra's intention to implement that price increase by letter dated 23 September 2005.
On 24 October 2005, the Commission "consented" to the HomeLine Part increase.
The Commission points out that that consent, given for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 (Cth) and a specific statutory instrument, involved no view as to whether the proposed conduct would contravene the "competition rule" as defined in s 151AK of the Act.
7 On 30 November 2005, the Commission wrote to Telstra requesting that it refrain from implementing the Home Access increase pending further investigation by the Commission and consultation with Telstra's wholesale customers.
The Commission expressed concern that the proposed increases would take advantage of market power and have the effect of substantially lessening competition.
