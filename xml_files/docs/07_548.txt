 
1 The application brought by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to wind up De Simone Consulting Pty Ltd has been withdrawn.
The issue that still separates the parties is who should bear the costs of the application.
The registrar before whom the application was initially returned decided that they should be borne by the company.
Dissatisfied with that decision, the company applies for its review which is now before me as a hearing de novo.
2 The jurisdiction to determine costs notwithstanding that a proceeding has been settled is undoubted.
While the jurisdiction is clear, the task is difficult unless the judge can form a view about the merits of the case.
If that cannot be done there is often little choice but to let the costs lie where they fall.
3 This case is said to be one of those where the merits are clear.
To understand the argument I need only mention a few of the background facts.
The Deputy Commissioner's application for the winding up of the company was grounded on the company's failure to comply with a statutory demand for unpaid tax in the sum of $408,500.96.
The company denied liability to pay that amount but did not apply to have the statutory demand set aside.
The Deputy Commissioner issued the application to wind up the company on 13 October 2006, supported by the usual affidavits.
When the application first came on before the registrar on 16 November 2006, Mr De Simone, a director of the company, produced a suitcase that contained several hundred thousand dollars in cash.
He said this was more than enough to meet the debt due to the Deputy Commissioner.
Mr De Simone also asserted that the production of the cash was evidence of the company's solvency.
He asked that the application be dismissed.
The stunt took everyone by surprise.
The application was stood over to enable the company to file proper evidence of its solvency.
4 The next event occurred on 8 December 2006.
On that day Mr De Simone served a lengthy affidavit deposing to the company's solvency.
In the following week, the company paid $175,000 to the Deputy Commissioner.
5 When the application again came before the registrar, the Deputy Commissioner asked for, and was granted, leave to withdraw the application.
There was then an argument about the costs.
The registrar decided they should be borne by the company.
That is the order which is the subject of the review.
6 For the purposes of deciding who should bear the costs I do not intend to enquire into the merits of the company's claim that it was not indebted to the Deputy Commissioner.
The argument is complicated and depends upon an agreement (the existence of which is not in dispute) between the company and the Deputy Commissioner to withdraw assessments of income tax that had been raised against the company and to reassess the company's liability.
One aspect of the argument is an assertion by the company that the statutory demand was based on the assessments that were to be withdrawn.
The Deputy Commissioner says this is not so.
7 It is accepted on both sides that the court only has jurisdiction to wind up a company in insolvency if the company is insolvent.
In the case of an application relying on a statutory demand, the court presumes the company is insolvent if it fails to comply with the statutory demand: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 459C(2)(a).
On the other hand, the presumption only operates except so far as the contrary is proved, the onus being on the company to establish its solvency: s 459C(3).
8 I now turn to the basis upon which the Deputy Commissioner says he is entitled to his costs.
The argument is that Mr De Simone's affidavit did not prove the solvency of the company and a winding up order would have been made had the Deputy Commissioner decided not to withdraw his application.
In this connection I was told of a practice that has developed by which a company wishing to prove its solvency must produce audited accounts that evidence solvency.
The practice is said to flow from the cases referred to by Weinberg J in Ace Contractors  Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 , a decision that has been cited with approval in Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb's Excavations Pty Ltd (2003) 45 ACSR 711, a decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales.
9 To put what I am about to say into its proper context I will set out the first three propositions that appear in the relevant part of Weinberg J's reasons.
