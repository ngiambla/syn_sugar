 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Before me are two applications which were heard together as the evidence and principles of law to be applied were relevantly the same.
It is convenient to deal with both proceedings in these reasons, although I will pronounce orders in each proceeding separately.
2 The applicant appeals under s 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) against the respondent's objection decision made on 13 December 2005 in respect of objections made by the applicant dated 5 January 2004, 27 July 2004 and 20 October 2004.
The applicant objected to assessments in respect of the interest derived by the Highland Unit Trust ('the Highland trust estate'), of which it was the trustee and of which GE Capital International Holdings ('GECIH'), a resident of the United States of America ('USA'), was the sole beneficiary, made by:
 
 (a) notices of amended assessment dated 13 June 2002 and 21 June 2005 in respect of the interest derived in the year ended 31 December 2000 in lieu of 30 June 2001 and 31 December 2001 in lieu of 30 June 2002;
 (b) notice of amended assessment 12 May 2003 in respect of the interest derived in the year ended 31 December 2002 in lieu of 30 June 2003;
 (c) notice of amended assessment dated 23 June 2004 in respect of the interest derived in the year 31 December 1999 in lieu of 30 June 2000;
 (d) notice of amended assessment dated 21 July 2005 in respect of the interest derived in the year 31 December 2003 in lieu of 30 June 2004; and 
 (e) notice of amended assessment dated 1 September 2005 in respect of the interest derived in the year ended 31 December 2004 in lieu of 30 June 2005.


3 The respondent treated the interest income as assessable income of the Highland trust estate and taxable in the hands of the applicant as trustee pursuant to s 98(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the Assessment Act').
In the years in question, s 98(3), so far as is relevant, provided as follows:
 
 Where a beneficiary of a trust estate who is presently entitled to a share of the income of the trust estate - 
 
 
 (a) is a company [and]
 (b) is a non-resident at the end of the year of income; 
 
 
 ... 
 the trustee of the trust estate shall be assessed and is liable to pay tax in respect of - 
 ... 
 
 
 (e) so much of that share of the net income of the trust estate as is attributable to a period when the beneficiary was not a resident and is also attributable to sources in Australia, 
 at the rate declared by the Parliament for the purposes of this subsection.
