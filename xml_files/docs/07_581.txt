A statement of claim was filed on the same day.
Both the application and the statement of claim were subsequently amended.
On 6 November 2006 I ordered that the applicant's further amended statement of claim be struck out but granted leave to replead on or before 30 November 2006: see [2006] FCA 1441.
I expressed some scepticism as to whether a case under the former s 298K of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ") could be pleaded conformably with the reasons which I gave for striking out the pleading: see [2006] FCA 1441 at [34] .
Not deterred the applicant filed a further amended application and a second further amended statement of claim on 30 November 2006.
By notice of motion dated 18 December 2006, which was filed on 17 January 2007, the respondent seeks an order striking out the proceeding, or alternatively, the second further amended statement of claim.
2 The amended application sought the imposition of penalties on the respondent and orders for compensation, injunctions and declarations with respect to alleged contraventions of s 298K of the Act .
3 The further amended statement of claim was struck out because it did not plead facts sufficient to establish any contravention of s 298K before that provision was repealed on 27 March 2006.
Specifically, it was held that the facts pleaded did not establish that when, in December 2005 and February 2006, the respondent announced a decision to transfer four Airbuses to Jetstar late in 2006 and early in 2007 and that those aircraft would not be crewed by its employees, it had thereby injured or prejudicially changed the position of particular employees or threatened to do either or both of these things.
4 The further amended application retains the claim for relief arising from the alleged contraventions of s 298K.
In the alternative, equivalent relief is sought for alleged contraventions of s 792 of the amended Act .
5 The second further amended statement of claim ("the amended pleading") retains the same basic allegations which were contained in its predecessor.
In particular, the relevant decision continues to be identified, in para 19A, as a decision that Jetstar would commence international operations by early 2007 and that the respondent would provide Jetstar with the four Airbuses but would not permit those aircraft to be crewed by its employees.
That decision is said to have been made in December 2005 and announced at various times in December 2005 and February 2006.
