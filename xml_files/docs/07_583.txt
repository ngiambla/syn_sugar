 
1 These two cases concern the attempts of investors in a failed start-up company, Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd, to recoup their losses from those who are said to have induced their investments or who were otherwise liable to them for their losses.
2 In the first proceeding, that initiated by Rawley Pty Ltd as trustee for the Tiltform Unit Trust and by Connoisseur Holdings Pty Ltd as a beneficiary of that trust, claims are made (i) against the first respondent, Geoffrey Bell, for negligent misrepresentation; (ii) against Bell and the second respondent, Robert Sladojevic, for declaratory relief and damages in respect of their being concerned in, or aiding and abetting of, contraventions of ss 52 and 59 (2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TP Act ") and the equivalent provisions of the Fair Trading Acts of South Australia and Western Australia; (iii) as a result of a late amendment, against Bell and Sladojevic for declaratory relief and damages/compensation under s 1325 of the Corporations Law in respect of contraventions of s 995 of the Law; and (iv) against Bell and Sladojevic, for compensation for breach of fiduciary duty as alleged promoters of Tiltform Australia.
No claim for relief is made against the company, Tiltform Licensing Pty Ltd, whom it is alleged contravened the above statutory provisions.
The misleading or deceptive conduct claims made against Bell and Sladojevic relate nonetheless to conduct attributable to Tiltform Licensing.
3 In the second proceeding Amin Chehade makes like claims against Bell and Sladojevic although the conduct relied upon to found these claims differs significantly from that in issue in the Rawley matter.
Nonetheless as the two proceedings share much in their factual substratum, it has been considered appropriate that they be dealt with together and it was ordered that the evidence in one, insofar as it was relevant and admissible, would be evidence in the other.
4 In both the Rawley and Chehade matters there are, additionally, cross-claims by Bell against CGU Insurance Ltd challenging CGU's cancellation of his professional indemnity insurance policy.
He seeks indemnification etc in respect of any liability to Rawley or Chehade in the present matters.
The cross-claims will be considered in the last part of these reasons.
5 In both matters the conduct of which complaint is made occurred over roughly a three month period in 2000.
Only one set of the representations impugned --- those of Sladojevic of 7 August 2000 --- is evidenced in a document.
The rest were allegedly oral.
Their having been made is disputed.
Issues of credibility, of alleged reconstruction and of accuracy of recall beset this matter.
As will be seen, I have rejected oral evidence of all of the principal witnesses in some degree.
6 In the event I have concluded that both applications and Bell's cross-claims should be dismissed.
7 There is a bewildering array of corporate and other actors who have participated in the events leading to these proceedings.
To assist understanding I have appended two schedules to these reasons.
The first lists the various corporations mentioned in these reasons.
Many have the word "Tiltform" in their name.
The purpose of the list is to help in differentiating them.
The second list is of the various natural persons to whom I will refer in these reasons.
It indicates the respective positions of each person and his or her relationship to the companies mentioned in Schedule 1.
8 For ease in exposition I will deal with the general background and setting to the claims made in both matters in my consideration of the Rawley claims.
The matters distinct to the Chehade claims will be deferred to my separate consideration of those claims.
9 I would add that the ready resolution of these matters was complicated by the unexpected duration of the hearing --- the taking of evidence occupied 21 days --- by Bell representing himself throughout, by Sladojevic changing his legal representatives when the trial had been adjourned after 11 days of hearing, and by the colourable character or uncertain provenance of some parts of the documentary evidence.
THE RAWLEY CLAIMS 
 The Principal Actors and Background Information 
 (i) Sladojevic 
 
10 In 1997 Sladojevic, with Alex Vinet, developed a new concrete formwork system which was designed primarily for use in on-site casting of concrete wall panels and other concrete structures ("the Tiltform technology").
AR Tiltform Pty Ltd ("Tiltform") was formed in 1998 to hold the intellectual property rights to the technology for which a patent application had been lodged.
Between 1997 and 1999 Sladojevic and Vinet conducted the businesses of manufacturing formwork and concrete panels and of hiring out the formwork through a company, A R Tiltwall Services Pty Ltd.
They were each directors and 50 per cent shareholders in both of the above companies.
In March 1999 the manufacturing business was sold to Dino Pietrobon who had formed a company called Tiltwall Services Pty Ltd.
In August 1999 Tiltform Licensing Pty Ltd ("Tiltform Licensing") was incorporated for the purpose of conducting the hire business as trustee for a unit trust the beneficiaries of which were investment companies of Sladojevic and Vinet.
Vinet and Sladojevic were directors and, indirectly, each 50 per cent shareholders in A R Tiltwall Services, Tiltform and Tiltform Licensing.
Save for retaining a 25 per cent interest in Tiltform, Vinet resigned his positions and interests in these companies in September 1999 in circumstances to which passing reference will later be made.
Sladojevic then held a 100 per cent interest in Tiltform Licensing.
Prior to Vinet's resignation it was decided to expand Tiltform Licensing's hiring business and to market it throughout Australia.
On the advice of Bell, who had previously been retained by Sladojevic and AR Tiltwall Services, it was decided to implement the expansion by licensing others to hire out the formwork system.
So the process began of attracting licensees which resulted in these proceedings.
(ii) Bell 
 
11 In 1997 Bell was the sole member of an accounting practice trading under the name Bell Partners.
He had previously been a partner in an established firm.
As at mid-1999, Bell Partners provided both accounting and business consulting services.
Sladojevic retained Bell as his accountant and business adviser in early 1998.
He was later engaged to provide services for Tiltwall Services and Tiltform and he incorporated Tiltform Licensing.
In time Bell Partners became the accountants and advisers for the Tiltform group of companies which became the business' major client.
Bell engaged Amin Chehade as an accountant in 1997, Chehade providing the accountancy services and Bell the business advisory services of Bell Partners.
In April/May 2000, Bell Partners moved to premises at Greenhill Road, Wayville.
On the same relatively open-planned floor of the building were the offices of the Tiltform group and, later, Tiltform Australia's office.
Bell regarded this arrangement with Sladojevic under which they worked closely together and shared Bell Partners facilities as being mutually beneficial because that was "what was required of my involvement with the Tiltform Group".
In late July 2000 he offered to sell his practice to Chehade for, according to Bell, $200,000 and, later, for $50,000 with vendor finance.
Chehade declined both offers.
By August 2000 Bell had joined Tiltform Licensing as a director.
He had earlier (September 1999) taken, indirectly, a 5 per cent share interest in the company.
Chehade being unprepared to buy Bell's practice, Bell sold Bell Partners in late 2000.
He fell out with Sladojevic in early 2001 and resigned all his positions in the Tiltform group around this time.
(iii) Benson 
 
12 Benson was the managing director of Tiltform Australia from its formation in May 2000 until it was wound up in April 2001.
Though involved in some number of the meetings, etc in dispute in this proceedings, he is one of the few apparently disinterested principal actors in that he is not a party to these proceedings.
The following skeletal outline of the circumstances giving rise to the formation of Tiltform Australia is not intended to represent findings.
My purpose here is simply to provide background to the matters that are in issue.
Benson controlled a company, Burnstop Pty Ltd, that supplied specialised building products to the building industry.
His wife, Rita, had had previous business contact with Sladojevic and became aware that he was considering selling the hiring business.
At the end of 1999 or early 2000 they met with Sladojevic at which meeting the Tiltform system was explained to them as was his proposal to licence it in each State.
Benson apparently evinced an interest in the South Australian licence but was informed that there was an in-principle agreement with a Jim Brennan to take that licence and one other.
He was also told that the WA licence was not available.
Nonetheless he was supplied with "roll-out" booklets for each State except Western Australia containing details of the costs of the respective licence and forecasts of potential income.
Benson then sought advice from an Andrew Lloyd, a financial adviser, who, having been shown the booklets, suggested that Benson proceed not only with the South Australia licence but should seek to obtain the licence for the whole country.
Benson believed he did not have the capital to go into the purchase of the South Australian licence and needed somebody to assist him in raising funds to do so.
13 In the course of discussions involving Bell, Sladojevic, Benson and Lloyd in January (though all were not present at each discussion), the proposal for a licence for all of Australia (excluding Western Australia) was considered.
After obtaining legal advice Jim Brennan was offered, and acquiesced in taking, the licence for New Zealand.
By early February 2000 Bell was supplying Benson with draft documents for the national licence excluding Western Australia.
On 10 February Bell indicated to Benson the details of the basis of any licensing arrangement with Benson.
These included a payment of $890,000 for the Territories on offer (these included $90,000 for SA/NT and $300,000 for Victoria/Tasmania), $500,000 to be paid upfront and $390,000 on terms to be agreed, $50,000 would be required as a deposit.
Benson subsequently indicated that he and Lloyd would proceed first with the SA/NT licence before the eastern States licences and offered $50,000 deposit for that licence.
Bell continued to hold out for the upfront payment of $500,000.
14 The expected $50,000 deposit had not been paid by 24 February leading to Bell's complaints about delay.
By 2 March Benson and Lloyd had made advances to Bell of $50,000 of which Benson provided a total of $10,000.
He had no recollection of making any other payments on his own behalf.
Apparently on 13 March 2000 Benson took over Tiltform Licensing's hire business.
At that time he had not paid the SA/NT licence fee, nor had he paid a further $60,000 for the purchase of the SA formwork.
Throughout April and May Bell and Sladojevic remained concerned that the moneys promised by Benson and Lloyd were not forthcoming.
Bell complained of this on 26 April 2000.
The response was a cheque drawn on the Lloyd Family Trust for $250,000 which was dishonoured on 7 June 2000.
It was made plain to Benson that he needed a new investor if he was going to secure the licences.
He ceased dealing with Lloyd and introduced Dr Ben Abraham as an investor.
Ben Abrahams paid Bell $250,000 in early June.
To backtrack, Tiltform Australia was incorporated on 1 May 2000.
Benson was then its sole shareholder and director.
Its licence agreement for South Australia and the Northern Territory was executed on 6 June 2000.
By this time the first of the meetings giving rise to the Rawley proceedings --- that of 2 June 2000 --- had occurred.
By at least early-mid July, Tiltform Australia's offices were on the same floor of the Greenhill Road premises occupied by Bell Chehade and Tiltform Licensing.
(iv) The Ilic WA investors/the Icon Group 
 
15 Peter Ilic was an acquaintance of Sladojevic in Perth; his brother was Sladojevic's friend.
He and Sladojevic met up at a presentation of the Tiltform technology that Sladojevic gave in Perth in June 1999.
Ilic then indicated that he would see if he could get together a group to acquire an exclusive licence for Western Australia: Sladojevic later told him that the upfront fee "for a period spanning the life of the patent": Affidavit, par 34; was expected to be around $100,000.
Ongoing royalties would also be payable.
A company, subsequently called Tiltform Concrete Systems (WA) Pty Ltd ("Tiltform WA") which was operated by Ilic, a Darren Jennings and Joe Barone executed an exclusive licence 20 March 2000.
Barone, who seems to have been Ilic's father-in-law, financed the investment through a $225,000 funding arrangement with Ilic apparently designed to get the business up and running.
I note in passing that in December 1999/January 2000 Ilic, who had previously worked in Sydney with Sladojevic, worked in the Adelaide offices of Tiltform Licensing to learn the conduct of the hiring operations.
16 The licensing agreement reached with Sladojevic deferred payment of the $100,000 licence fee until 1 July 2000.
Bell's evidence was that the reason for the deferral was because the company needed to purchase formwork and Barone's money was put into that.
This was seen as "their most functional way of going".
A product launch which Sladojevic attended was held in Perth.
After that demonstration a director of Icon Group Management Pty Ltd ("the Icon Group"), Guiseppe ("Joe") Murabito, met Sladojevic.
While impressed with the technology, he said he expressed no interest in it at that stage.
He did tell another of the Icon directors who also was there --- Renato Palmiero --- that he thought Icon Group should approach Tiltform WA and seek some form of "preferred contractor" status.
Murabito recommended the system as well to Gavin Lee, the company's third director and to its accountant, Greg Parker.
Shortly after Icon Group commenced hiring from Tiltform WA, discussions were initiated between Ilic and Icon Group regarding investing in Ilic's company.
There is some debate over whether Ilic approached Murabito and Icon Group at Sladojevic's suggestion, or whether Icon Group approached Ilic.
Be this as it may, it is clear that Icon Group decided it would be more economical for it to acquire the WA licence than to hire formwork from Tiltform WA.
It was also known that Barone wished to withdraw his $225,000 from the business and that Tiltform WA needed working capital.
Murabito raised the prospect of investing in Tiltform WA at a directors meeting on 26 May 2000 at which an investment proposal which probably emanated from Ilic was discussed.
There had been some exchange of correspondence prior to that meeting.
The proposal, according to Parker, was for Icon Group to take a 72 per cent equity interest in Tiltform WA for $505,000 plus a further $70,000 to pay out a director's loan.
Parker was asked by the Icon directors if he wished to review this investment opportunity personally, not as their accountant, as they were interested in looking at it as investors --- Parker agreed to this.
A week later he and Murabito were at their first meeting with Sladojevic and Bell in Adelaide.
(v) Parker 
 
17 Though a central figure in the Rawley proceedings, all that need be noted of Parker at this point is that he was Icon Group's independent accountant; he was the person to who Murabito, Lee and Palmiero looked to for financial advice relating to the proposed investment in Tiltform WA; he, with Lee, became the original trustees of the Tiltform Unit Trust in August 2000, that trust being the vehicle through which the investment in Tiltform Australia was made by Murabito, Palmiero, Lee, Parker (via his company Rawley), Airport Consulting Pty Ltd and Connoisseur Holdings Pty Ltd (collectively the "WA investors"); and he became a director of Tiltform in Australia in early September of 2000.
(vi) Lee 
 
18 Reference has been made to Lee above.
I would note additionally that he was involved in most of the events giving rise to the Rawley proceedings.
He was an architect and builder and at or around the relevant times he was studying for, and obtained, an MBA.
For a period shortly after the investment was made in Tiltform Australia on 11 August, he worked in Adelaide as General Manager of Tiltform Australia.
He was appointed a director of Tiltform Australia on 4 September 2000 although that appointment was never formally registered.
THE TILTFORM TECHNOLOGY, TILTFORM LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS 
 
19 What follows is an account of (a) the status of aspects of the Tiltform technology insofar as it is relevant in these proceedings and of disputes, real and contrived, involving the/a Tiltform patent; and (b) documents prepared for Tiltform Licensing relating to the marketing and licensing of the technology.
It is convenient to deal with these matters here as they provide background and context, for an understanding of the principal events described later in these reasons.
The technology/patent issues 
 
20 I have earlier given a description of the essence of the Tiltform technology.
It was, to an extent at least, the subject of one or more patent applications as is evidenced in the Schedule to the SA/NT Licence Agreement.
It seems that at least one patent was later granted in respect of it.
It is also clear that the technology itself became the subject of litigation(s) between a company or companies associated with Gino Pietrobon (who purchased the manufacturing business of A R Tiltwall Services) and Tiltform Licensing.
An aspect of these litigations was an alleged patent breach by a Pietrobon company of Tiltform's "patent" --- a breach which was witnessed by Sladojevic on 6 August 2000.
There has been some controversy as to when Sladojevic became aware of the breach, although I am satisfied that it probably was on or about the date I have given.
Both Bell and Benson were made aware of this matter when in New Zealand on 7 August although Benson may well have had prior knowledge of it.
By 10 August 2000 Sladojevic and Bell were meeting with patent attorneys to discuss the breaches of patent.
It is unnecessary for me to determine when the relevant patent was granted (it seems not to have been before the above date) although it does seem that, by later in the year, patent litigation was on foot and was continuing up to the time Tiltform Australia went into voluntary administration.
There appears to have been communications between Sladojevic and at least Benson as to the sharing of the costs of the action against the Pietrobon company.
21 A difficulty I have with the evidence is that, despite insisting during oral evidence his solicitor had "drilled into him" to distinguish between a "patent" and a "patent application", Sladojevic not only in his affidavit (see e.g.
par 34) but also in documents he authored, used the term "patent" to describe both.
I am not prepared to accept he was any more precise in oral communication.
I will return to this.
I should also add that there are documents, the provenance of the information in which can be traced back to Sladojevic, which create an entirely false impression of the patent litigation and its prospects.
As I will later indicate these documents were contrivances designed to secure an advantage to Sladojevic in his subsequent dealings with Vinet in late 2000.
22 Benson's evidence is that he learned of the alleged Pietrobon breach of the patent before the Rawley Unit Trust investors made their investment in Tiltform Australia.
He could not recall if he told them about it.
Parker's evidence is that he did not become aware of this litigation before March 2001 and that mention of it did not find its way into board minutes of Tiltform Australia.
It is clear from correspondence between Lee and Tiltform Australia's lawyers of 14 and 19 September 2000 that Lee both was aware of the breach of patent proceedings and of Tiltform Licensing's pursuit of a cost-sharing arrangement with Tiltform Australia for the litigation.
Marketing and licensing documents 
 
23 There are four classes of document used by Tiltform in the conduct of its licensing business to which I need refer.
These are (i) the marketing proposal booklets; (ii) confidentiality agreements; (iii) disclosure documents created in accordance with the Franchising Code of Conduct: see Trade Practices (Industry Codes Franchising) Regulations 1998 (Cth); and (iv) licensing agreements.
24 The marketing proposal booklets for the various State and Territory licences on offer had their genesis in a document prepared by Sladojevic (with assistance) at some time in late 1999.
They were based on an assessment of the size of the Adelaide market and on actual trading results in Australia.
These were extrapolated to determine the likely size and profitability of the markets in the other States and Territories.
Copies of the booklets are in evidence.
Apart from describing the virtues of the Tiltform system, each outlined the costs, the savings effected and the rental and sales rates and profitability in the Adelaide market and then went on under the heading "proposed roll out costs and returns for the [respective State] market" to provide an 8 year profit/loss projection for that State.
25 As I earlier indicated, Sladojevic provided Benson with copies of these booklets in late 1999/early 2000.
In his affidavit Sladojevic stated he provided the copy relating to Western Australia to Ilic prior to Tiltform WA entering into the WA licence agreement.
There is no evidence suggesting that either Ilic or Benson provided any of the Icon Group directors or Parker with such a booklet prior to their proposed investment in Tiltform WA or their actual investment in Tiltform Australia.
26 The confidentiality agreements were of a form routinely used in business negotiations.
They were required to be signed by Murabito and Parker prior to their first meeting with Sladojevic and Bell in Adelaide on 2 June of 2000.
27 The disclosure document (prescribed by the TP Act s 51AE) is in evidence and was given to Benson and Lloyd for the proposed Australian licences (other than Western Australia).
Of present relevance, the document outlines estimates of projected establishment costs and/or costs items to start up the hiring business in each State and Territory; the initial licence fee for each licence; and the ongoing licence fee of 7 per cent.
In relation to "Earnings Information" it stated:
 
 "The licensor does not give earnings information about any proposed licence.
Any previously presented financial figures or projections of the licensor must (other than for actual trading figures) not be relied upon by the licensee (See Special Condition 14.1(a)) and have been put forward as a guideline only for the licensee's own assessment with its accounting and other professional advisors.
Earnings may vary between licences.
The only actual earnings are that of the business in South Australia conducted by the licensor since February 1999, for which enquiries can be made direct with the licensor or its accountant and Item 20 hereof will provide some financial details of the same.
"
 

28 It is Parker's evidence (which I accept) that he received the above version some time prior to a meeting on 17 July to which reference is made below.
29 Several of the licence agreements (some signed, some not) are in evidence.
They are in standard form.
I will refer only to the SA/NT licence for present purposes.
It contains clauses favourable to the licensor and intrusive powers to control the licensee which commonly are found in exclusive licences involving the use and exploitation of intellectual property.
For present purposes I merely note the following.
The licensee was obliged (i) to use a specified "Tiltform" business name and to have its corporate name regulated: cl 8.1; Sched cl 15.19; (ii) to have its advertising pre-approved: cl 8.4; (iii) to have its manager approved in writing: cl 8.7; (iv) to keep approved hiring and sales reports and to deliver these to the licensor as directed: cl 8.13; and (v) to keep approved books of accounts and records and to operate such accounting systems as the licensor prescribed and to permit the licensor and its agents to inspect etc the same when so requested: cl 8.14.
Importantly, cl 11.2.4 provided:
 
 
 
 "11.2.4 If the Licensee is a corporation (whether in its own right or as trustee of any trust) there shall be:-
 
 (i) no change in the directors of the Licensee;
 (ii) no allotment of shares by the Licensee; or
 (iii) no registration or any transfer of shares;
 
 without first obtaining the prior written approval of the Licensor.
"
 
 
 

The licence was unassignable without the prior written approval of the licensor: cl 12.1.
A separate clause conferred a veto power on any allotment or sale by the Licensee of shares or of units in a unit trust which had the effect of transferring the effective control of the corporation or unit trust to a third party.
THE MATTERS IN ISSUE 
 
30 There are four separate events or actions taken between 2 June 2000 and 7 August 2000 at, or in, which Sladojevic and/or Bell are alleged to have made actionable misrepresentations on behalf of Tiltform Licensing.
These were:
 
(1) on 2 June at a meeting in Adelaide --- 
 
 
 (i) Sladojevic represented to Parker that investment in the Tiltform group was a secure investment; and 
 (ii) Bell and Sladojevic assured Parker as to the commercial viability of claims made by and on behalf of the Tiltform Group with respect to the "Icon Group's" proposed agreement to take a 72 per cent interest in Tiltform WA.

 
 
 (2) on 26 June at a meeting in Perth --- 
 
 
 (iii) Bell represented to the Icon Group directors and Parker that over $2 million in investment for Tiltform Australia had already been raised; 
 (iv) Sladojevic represented that there would be sufficient working capital in Tiltform Australia;
 (3) on 17 July at a meeting in Adelaide with Benson, Parker and Lee ---
 (v) Bell again represented that the capital sum of 2 million dollars had already been raised for Tiltform Australia; and 
 
 
 (4) on 7 August Sladojevic sent a letter to Benson, intending it to be forwarded to Parker and the WA investors, which stated that: 
 
 
 (vi) unless they were to commit to Tiltform Australia within 48 hours the investment opportunity would be lost; 
 (vii) Tiltform Licensing had previously been offered the sum of $250,000 for the WA licence;
 (viii) the funds were required within the 48 hours at which time negotiations with other investors who wished to invest in Tiltform Australia would be resumed; and
 (ix) Sladojevic had spoken that day to Tiltform Australia Chairman, John Dawkins, and was certain that Dawkins could find replacement investors.

 

31 Additionally, because of the non-disclosure of information in relation to some number of matters, it is pleaded that Bell and/or Sladojevic engaged in other material instances of misleading or deceptive conduct.
These, for the most part, have been abandoned.
I will deal separately with the few remaining non-disclosure claims relied upon: see below "Other Misleading Conduct".
32 The pleading translates the conduct of Bell and Sladojevic into claims under the TP Act in a rather circuitous and, to a degree, an unrevealing way.
That conduct is said to have contravened s 52 and s 59 of the TP Act .
The primary contravenor is said in the application to be Tiltform Licensing although no relief is sought in the proceeding against that company.
Declarations and damages are sought against Bell and Sladojevic under s 82 of the TP Act on the basis that, for the purposes of s 75B of the TP Act , they were knowingly involved in Tiltform Licensing's contraventions.
Parallel claims are made against them under the equivalent provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (SA) and the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA).

 
33 Following amendments to the application and pleadings which I raised with the parties after the hearing of the matter, the same conduct of Bell and Sladojevic as was said to have contravened s 52 of the TP Act was alleged in the alternative to have contravened s 995 of the Corporations Law.
Relief was sought under s 1325 of the Law.
This amendment was a technical, but necessary, one.
The reason I raised it with the parties is that the matter was founded on the premise that the alleged wrongs gave right to causes of action under Part V of the TP Act .
Those wrongs were committed at various dates in 2000 and were related to dealings in the "securities" (i.e.
shares) of Tiltform Australia.
At that time s 51AF of the then TP Act stipulated that Part V did not apply to the supply of services that are financial services.
Such "services" includes "securities": see Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 1989 (Cth), s 12BA(1) ("financial services").
Section 995 of Ch 7 Pt 7.11 of the Corporations Law as it stood in 2000 prohibited a person in connection with any dealings in securities from engaging in conduct that was misleading or deceptive or was likely to mislead or deceive (i.e.
the same formula in part as in s 52 of the TP Act ).
"Securities" were defined in the Law to include "shares": s 92(2).
Relief could be granted under s 1325 of the Corporations Law in respect of conduct constituting a contravention of Pt 7.11.
Finally, s 995A of the Corporations Law provided that the provisions of State Fair Trading Acts (defined in s 9 to include those relied upon in these proceedings) did not apply to dealings in securities.
If the principal claims made in the Rawley --- and for that matter the Chehade --- matter were not to be dismissed on formal jurisdictional grounds, the amendment I raised was necessary.
34 A separate negligence claim is made against Bell who it is said owed a duty of care to the applicants in making representations to them in relation to their proposed investments in, first, Tiltform WA and the Tiltform Australia; reasonable reliance on those representations is pleaded, the representations being essentially the same as the misrepresentations and other misconduct pleaded against him in the Misleading or deceptive conduct claim.
Breach of the alleged duty of care arose essentially because of the same factors that rendered the representations misleading or deceptive in the Misleading or deceptive conduct claim.
35 A further claim is made against Bell and Sladojevic as promoters of Tiltform Australia.
The basis of this claim appears to be that they were promoting the taking up of shares in Tiltform Australia although, as put, much is made of the allegedly fiduciary character of the licensor (Tiltform Licensing) and licensee (Tiltform Australia) relationship.
I would note here that, at the beginning of the hearing I indicated my difficulty with this claim.
The supplementary submissions advanced after the end of the hearing have not dispelled my difficulty.
The breach of fiduciary duty asserted arises from alleged non-disclosure of matters that relate in the main to dealings between Tiltform Licensing and Benson prior to the emergence of the WA investors in June 2000 although the non-disclosures also relate to conduct in issue in, or else relevant to, the misleading or deceptive conduct claims.
36 I will as a matter of convenience deal with the misleading or deceptive conduct claims first.
They provide an appropriate vehicle through which to expose most of what is in issue in each of the claims.
THE MISLEADING OR DECEPTIVE CONDUCT CLAIMS 
 
37 The applicants in this matter have not abandoned their TP Act and State Fair Trading Act claims notwithstanding that they have, in my view, been excluded by the then s 51AF of the TP Act and s 995 of the Corporations Law.
Nonetheless, I will refer to both claims primarily because the substantial jurisprudence on what is misleading or deceptive, etc for TP Act purposes is generally applicable to s 995 (and its successor in s 1041H of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)): see generally Ford's Principles of Corporations Law , 22.450 (13 th ed 2007).
38 By way of statutory background I should note, first, that a corporation contravenes s 52 of the TP Act if it engages in conduct in trade or commerce that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.
It is not in dispute in this matter that the misleading or deceptive conduct alleged, if it occurred, was in trade or commerce.
For present purposes, I need only note as well that conduct is misleading or deceptive if it induces or is capable of inducing error.
Whether it has this character is a question of fact to be determined on the evidence as to the context in which it occurred and the relevant surrounding facts.
So much is well established.
39 Though it has not loomed large at all in the applicants' submissions I should also note s 59(2) of the TP Act the contravention of which has been pleaded in relation to alleged misrepresentations with respect to the profitability of, and the level of working capital available to, Tiltform Australia.
It provides insofar as presently relevant:
 
 
 "(2) Where a corporation, in trade or commerce, invites, whether by advertisement or otherwise, persons to engage or participate, or to offer or apply to engage or participate, in a business activity requiring ... the investment of moneys by the persons concerned and the performance by them of work associated with the investment, the corporation shall not make, with respect to the profitability or risk or any other material aspect of the business activity, a representation that is false or misleading in a material particular.

40 Section 75B for present purposes deems a person to be involved in a contravention of (inter alia) Part V (which includes s 52 and s 59 by a corporation if that person "has been in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contravention": see s 75B(1)(c).
This, as I earlier noted, is the vehicle relied upon by the applicants to impose liability on Bell and Sladojevic under s 82 of the TP Act in respect of the contraventions alleged against Tiltform Licensing by virtue of their conduct: see Wheeler Grace  Pierucci Pty Ltd v Wright (1989) 11 ATPR 40-940.
Section 75B does not require that the participant knew he or she was participating in a contravention of the Act.
What, though, is required is actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention and intentional participation in it: Yorke v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 666 ff.
41 Section 82(1) provides:
 
 "A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of a provision of Part V may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention.
"
 

42 Turning now to the much more direct course laid open by s 995, subs (2) of that section provides that a person shall not, in or in connection with any dealing in securities engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.
I would note that this provision applies directly to "a person" hence the lack of any need to pursue Bell or Sladojevic via accessorial liability provisions as is necessary under the TP Act .
43 Section 1325(1), insofar as presently relevant, empowers the Court to compensate a person who has suffered loss or damage because of another's conduct that was engaged in in contravention of s 995 for the loss or damage so suffered.
44 While I will deal in turn with the principal events in which misleading or deceptive conduct is alleged to have been engaged in, I preface this with observations on the principal witnesses in this matter.
The need for this will become plainly apparent given the issues of credibility and reliability I have already foreshadowed.
WITNESSES AND WITNESS ISSUES 
 
45 It is clear both from their evidence and from their conduct in this proceeding that a considerable level of personal hostility came to exist --- and still exists --- between Sladojevic and Parker.
Both are quite opinionated.
Their personal styles are markedly different and their personalities clashed.
I am not prepared to discount their animosity in my treatment of the evidence of either of them, but of Parker in particular.
I consider the view he has of Sladojevic, of his personality and of his behaviour has on occasion coloured his evidence and the subject matter of his recall.
In saying this I am not suggesting his evidence was deliberately dishonest or vengeful.
46 Bell's relationship with Sladojevic is equally a matter of which account ought be taken in evaluating his actions as revealed in the evidence.
He and Sladojevic clearly had a successful working relationship over a number of years to the point where Bell was prepared to forsake his professional practice and to join forces with Sladojevic in the Tiltform group.
However, that relationship unravelled over a relatively short time.
Bell's own evidence is that he could be persuaded and/or dominated by Sladojevic to the extent of engaging in actions which he might otherwise have refrained from doing.
That he would so act was demonstrated starkly in his participation in the successful strategy of September 2000 to get Vinet to agree to sell his shares in Tiltform which required the deliberate giving of false instructions to lawyers and to making of serious misrepresentations about the viability and poor financial position of the Tiltform group of companies.
Bell knew this was a sham; he was unhappy about it; but he went along with it: see below, "Sladojevic's deceptive strategies".
By November 2000 he was wanting to get out; he did not like the way things were going and the way business was being done; Sladojevic "stopped listening to my advice"; he was denied access to Tiltform Licensing's books; etc.
In January 2001 lawyers representing Sladojevic wrote to Bell on several occasions making serious imputations against him.
The allegations were denied but this heralded the end of Bell's relationship with Sladojevic.
They each executed a deed of release on 5 March 2001.
It emerged in Sladojevic's cross-examination that the allegations made in the January letters were again "strategy" representations.
Sladojevic conceded the instructions he gave were not true: such allegations "get made for leverage".
Bell, seemingly, was unaware of this when he gave evidence in the matter.
I have recounted the above, not because Bell has given evidence sharply critical of Sladojevic (which he has not) but because the nature of his relationship with Sladojevic probably provides some explanation of his actions.
47 I equally should comment on Sladojevic's relationship with Benson.
This relationship needs to be considered bearing two matters in mind --- first, Sladojevic's tendency to domineer; and, secondly, his power over Tiltform Australia by virtue of the licence agreements Tiltform Licensing had with it.
While Benson was, in the relevant period, within Sladojevic's power vis--vis investments to be made in Tiltform Australia, the evidence is that at that time their relationship was cordial.
I accept that Benson readily accepted and acted upon proposals and suggestions of Sladojevic relating to securing investment in Tiltform Australia.
But I do not accept, and it has not been suggested, that Sladojevic was in essence a "shadow director" of Tiltform Australia: cf Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Deverall [2001] Ch 340 at 354; Australian Securities Commission v A S Nominees Ltd (1995) 133 ALR 1 at 52-53.
The evidence is that Benson had and relied upon his own financial advisers in relation to the formation and their operation of Tiltform Australia and that he was experienced in the conduct of his own businesses.
I do not accept that he was simply Sladojevic's cipher despite Parker's occasional attempts to paint him as such.
48 As I have foreshadowed issues of reliability and credibility have loomed large in this matter.
The critical events occurred five years before the hearing in this matter and occurred within a very short period (i.e.
2 June --- 7 August 2000).
None of the misrepresentations about which complaint is made (save that of 7 August) is evidenced, or even alluded to, in any way in contemporary documents.
The three critical meetings (i.e.
of 2 June, 26 June and 17 July) at which misrepresentations are alleged to have been made, are the subject of totally divergent and inconsistent accounts.
49 Because of the views at which I have arrived as to the reliability of the various witnesses, it is appropriate that I provide some explanation at the outset of why I regard them individually as I do.
50 Parker has obviously invested considerable time and effort in attempting to recall the events leading up to and the reasons for, the WA investment.
There is nothing in his own contemporary notes to support his claims that the oral misrepresentations were made.
I consider that significant parts of his evidence, particularly when describing what he says were his own opinions, judgments, understandings and motivations at the time, are unreliable.
I am satisfied that those opinions etc, often represent after the event rationalisations and explanations for his own actions and they often ascribe significance to matters which those matters did not have to him at the time.
51 I do not consider Parker to have been untruthful.
Rather he has in certain critical respects convinced himself that things were said or done which I have not found to be made out on the evidence before me.
I accept in this that he was influenced by his motivation to do his best for the investors he had brought into the WA group and for whose loss he appears to feel a responsibility.
This is understandable given the manner in which that loss was incurred.
52 Lee .
This witness' affidavit contained a significant number of annexures with the contents of which he had well familiarised himself.
When taken away from these documents his evidence was far less convincing.
I am satisfied that there was a significant degree of reconstruction in his evidence.
What is clear is that he was unwilling to accept responsibility for financial decisions, the raising of financial concerns, etc.
These were, he said, Parker's responsibility.
I am by no means satisfied that he was so blindly trusting as he sought to convey.
53 Murabito .
Such was Murabito's lack of recall of events, that I consider his recall of a few strategically significant matters (e.g.
Bell's "$2 million" assurance on 26 June 2000) should be treated with circumspection.
In saying this, I am quite conscious of how fallible are memories and of the remoteness of the events about which Murabito was being questioned in close detail.
54 Benson .
Given he was not a party to these proceedings, but was an actor in some of the events that are in issue, it might be expected that Benson would provide helpful, independent evidence of those events and their context.
I have not found that to be the case.
I do not regard his evidence as either full or frank.
As his cross-examination progressed, he took refuge in his inability to recall matters.
I am satisfied that this often was a contrived response.
Even the applicants in submissions conceded that Benson sometimes gave the appearance of making no effort to recollect events.
While it is the case that Benson is a disinterested party in the present proceedings, he was by no means a disinterested actor in the life and death of Tiltform Australia.
I consider he was quite mindful of this and the implications of it in giving his evidence.
55 Bell .
Bell sought to project himself as an ethical, detached professional adviser.
Throughout this proceeding he represented himself.
His evidence-in-chief was given in narrative form.
From his business diaries and time sheets he could give what is probably a reliable account of objective facts such as where he was, who was there, etc.
The diaries, though, yielded little by way of information as to what was discussed at meetings etc. Bell's memory for the most part does not stretch far beyond his diaries and time sheets.
He conveyed the impression of wishing to consign from memory a period in which he made judgments and took actions which he has come to regret.
His oral evidence did not directly confront what had been put against him in the Rawley and the Chehade proceedings.
However, he denied volunteering the $2 million representation.
For a variety of reasons I do not regard Bell's evidence as reliable.
He was both dogmatic and counter-suggestive in cross-examination to the point on occasion of making assertions which either contradicted his own documents or else seemed contrived, adversarial responses.
I am satisfied he has limited recall of some of the critical events in this matter despite his confident assertions concerning them.
I equally am satisfied that he has reconstructed and rationalised his evidence in ways that best serve the interests of his case.
I consider this to be particularly so concerning the meeting of 2 June 2000.
I have disbelieved the evidence he gave concerning his actions during the day of, and at the meeting of, 26 June.
His answers on occasion were designedly obfuscatory, as for example when he denied that the 26 June meeting was a meeting which later led him to distinguish between "formal" and "informal" meetings.
He equally, but unconvincingly, created the impression of indifference to, or lack of interest in, matters with which he obviously had a real concern or interest.
This was particularly so in relation to the financial affairs of Tiltform Australia and to the payment of licence fees.
Though he claimed for himself roles and responsibilities in Tiltform Licensing he often enough disclaimed actual responsibility in matters which seemingly fell within his claimed sphere by asserting he was acting on Sladojevic's instructions or that the matter had been taken over by Sladojevic.
His claimed level of participation in the 2000 strategy to buy out Vinet typified this: see below.
56 Sladojevic .
It is difficult to accept major parts of Sladojevic's evidence.
His affidavit evidence, even after amendment, was conceded to be reconstructed from documents and was in important details inconsistent with his oral evidence.
The extent of this reconstruction is indeterminate.
As a witness he was argumentative, evasive and obviously self serving in the gratuitous commentary in which he indulged.
When one couples this with the deviousness and ruthless self interest he betrayed on at least four occasions in engaging in deceptive "strategies": see below; reason for reserve about his evidence is clear.
He has engaged in opportunistic behaviour and has resorted to falsehood.
I am satisfied his evidence on any subject not corroborated by independent documentary evidence or a reliable third party ought be regarded with caution.
Sladojevic's deceptive strategies 
 
57 Sladojevic has admitted on three occasions in his evidence that he engaged in deception and/or known falsehood to secure perceived advantages for himself.
One such occasion involved the making of false accusations against Bell via lawyers' letters of January 2001 during the breakdown of their business relationship.
Another, not conceded by Sladojevic related to the letter of 7 August 2000 he wrote nominally to Benson, but intending that it be sent to the WA investors.
Later in these reasons I find that letter was, and was intended to be, misleading.
The two other occasions in which he resorted to deception concerned separate dealings he had with Vinet in 1999 and in 2000.
Given my concern with Sladojevic's credibility it is appropriate that I refer to these two occasions.
58 First the 1999 dealing with Vinet.
I have earlier noted that in September 1999 Vinet disposed of his interests in Tiltform and Tiltform Services (save for a 25 per cent interest in Tiltform) and resigned his directorship of both companies.
The following is only a skeletal account of how Sladojevic sought to procure these actions.
59 Having concluded by May of 1999 that it was impossible for he and Vinet to continue working together, Sladojevic met with Bell and his solicitor, Richard Solomon, for advice on how to resolve the matter.
He then evolved a strategy to get Vinet "to come to the table".
Wholly misleading accounts of the true financial position of Tiltform Licensing had been prepared such that it appeared to have considerable debts when it appears in fact to have been trading profitably.
Those accounts, though were used by Sladojevic as part of a proposal put by him to get Vinet to sell his shareholding.
Sladojevic equally communicated (falsely) to Vinet that his father who was in fact moving from Sydney to Adelaide to live with him because of ill health, had sold his house to relieve the cash flow problems of the Tiltform companies.
60 The proposals put to Vinet went through several iterations as the financial position of the companies were said to be "gradually getting worse".
In the result an agreement was struck under which Vinet sold most of his shareholdings and resigned his directorships.
Sladojevic's evidence is that he acted entirely of his own accord in this matter and that Bell was not involved in it.
61 The second Vinet strategy (in 2000) focussed on Vinet' s 25 per cent shareholding in Tiltform.
That company was the owner of the Tiltform intellectual properties.
It was proposed to have another Tiltform company, Tiltform Technologies Ltd, listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and central to this proposal was that that company owned all of the shares in Tiltform.
Sladojevic, Bell and several other persons evolved a strategy to induce Vinet to sell.
This strategy involved (inter alia) the knowingly false misrepresentations that (a) the Tiltform companies were unviable and in a poor financial position; (b) Sladojevic's father was pressing for repayment of his loan; (c) Bell had threatened to wind up the companies because he was owed "a huge amount of money for fees and had to be issued shares in Tiltform Licensing in lieu; (d) Bell served a statutory demand on one of the companies in October 2000 (Bell in fact had such a document prepared) and that he refused to provide financial support to Tiltform; (e) the companies did not have the funds to protect the patent from Pietrobon's breach of them and that four cases were on foot; and (f) patent attorneys had advised that Pietrobon's copy of Tiltform's system did not violate the patent, and this significantly decreased the value of the intellectual property.
As a result of this strategy Vinet agreed to transfer his shares in Tiltform to Sladojevic's father for no consideration provided he was given various warranties.
In the event the listing in New Zealand did not proceed and the Vinet issue was "left hanging".
I should add that, while Sladojevic's evidence is that Bell was complicit in this strategy, Bell sought quite self- servingly to distance himself from significant involvement in the strategy.
The evidence suggests otherwise as witness his instructions to solicitors in October 2000 to prepare a letter of demand in respect of previously written off debts at Sladojevic's suggestion, so enabling Sladojevic to point to it in relation to the supposed financial difficulties of Tiltform.
I am satisfied that Bell was a knowing participant in this strategy.
62 One consequence of the strategies in relation to Vinet is that documents created for the purposes of them have added very significantly to misinformation relied upon in the conduct of this proceeding.
Amendments were made to the pleadings and cross-examination conducted on the premise that the information conveyed in such documents was correct.
This resulted both in time wastage and quite a deal of confusion and contradiction for which Sladojevic principally, but also Bell in some degree, bear responsibility.
Affidavits 
 
63 I have referred above to my concern about the extent to which the evidence in this matter has been affected by reconstruction and for self-serving rationalisation.
It is unfortunate that in the case management of this proceeding a direction was given that evidence-in-chief would be by way of affidavit.
The giving of evidence in this form in this matter has added to the difficulty in determining on balance what occurred at, and what were the consequences that flowed from, meetings at which misrepresentations were allegedly made.
Having heard the principal witnesses in cross-examination, I have considerable reserve about aspects of the affidavits of all of them on the scores of reconstruction and of self-serving rationalisation.
1.
THE 2 JUNE MEETING 
 
64 The background to the 2 June meeting has been mentioned above.
After Parker had agreed to review the investment opportunity in Tiltform WA which had been discussed with the Icon Group directors on 26 May 2000, Parker (with Lee's assistance), prepared forecasts of the Cash Flow, Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet of Tiltform WA for the 2001-2003 financial years.
In doing this he relied upon a one page document prepared by Ilic which described the outlays, income and investment in the business in the period of its operation.
65 It is Parker's evidence, which I accept, that at this time he did not have, or have access to, the WA licence agreement, the disclosure document or the WA market proposal booklet.
While he had spoken to Ilic before 2 June, he did not look to him for significant assistance because, as he said of Ilic, "as far as business acumen is concerned ... he lacks the certain qualities that one is required to have when talking about these particular numbers".
He also said that Sladojevic expressed a like view of Ilic at the 2 June meeting.
66 Parker saw his function at the time as being that of conducting a "due diligence", and that in consequence the primary purpose of his visit to Adelaide to meet with Bell and Sladojevic on 2 June was to have the reasonableness of his financial projections confirmed.
Sladojevic in his affidavit said that Parker stated at the beginning of the 2 June meeting that he was attending "to evaluate the proposed purchase of shareholding in Tiltform WA".
I note in passing that it was Lee's evidence that the reason Murabito and Parker went to Adelaide on 2 June was because Sladojevic had to agree to any transfer of shares.
Parker's evidence on this was to the contrary.
He was unaware of such an approval requirement at the time and had not by then been supplied with a copy of the licence agreement imposing it.
67 On 31 May 2000 Murabito rang Sladojevic.
He informed Sladojevic that there had been discussions with Ilic in relation to purchasing a majority interest in Tiltform WA.
He went on to say, according to Sladojevic, that they wanted to meet with him and Bell "to discuss the proposal and licensing issues with us".
The following day Sladojevic sent a fax to Murabito confirming the meeting on 2 June at Tiltform Licensing's Greenhill Road offices.
The facsimile noted, amongst other things, the following:
 
 "Attending the meeting with me will be Mr Geoff Bell who is also an integral part of our organisation and responsible for the strategic planning of our organisation.
"
 

68 The meeting was held on the afternoon of 2 June.
Murabito and Parker, who had flown in from Perth, were required to sign confidentiality agreements.
It is Parker's oral evidence that Bell was introduced at the meeting as the accountant for Tiltform Licensing.
He reiterated often in his oral evidence that he dealt with Bell "as an accountant".
Bell later had informed him he had previously been the senior partner of a firm named Bentleys.
69 Despite the descriptions above as to the purposes of the meeting, there is wide divergence between Parker and Murabito on the one hand and Sladojevic and Bell on the other as to what transpired at it.
The only contemporary documentary evidence of the meeting was Parker's notes of it.
Significantly Bell denied that many of the matters referred to in the notes were discussed at all, or could be remembered by him.
What he was insistent upon, contrary to Parker's evidence, is that he was never shown the projections let alone approved them.
Without actually being shown the Parker notes, Sladojevic nonetheless confirmed that he recalled discussing most of the matters noted by Parker.
I would note in passing that Sladojevic did take issue with one notation referring to "patent documentation".
He emphasised there was at the time only a patent application.
70 It is unnecessary to reproduce the notes here.
They refer to the technology and to its potential, and to the licensing agreement.
Parker stated in cross-examination that he made the notes "while Sladojevic was talking" --- "during his explanation of where Tiltform was at".
He went on to say:
 
 "So what you are suggesting is that Mr Sladojevic was promoting the virtues of the system?---Most definitely.
You can see from the notes that I have made that it was all good stuff.
He informed you that as the technology was further developed, it would be made available to licensees?---That is correct, and that the projections that I had prepared were really not of any consequence because these improvements --- and you can see from the notes that I have made regarding door jambs, snap-on windows --- they were just going to blow the projections out of the water.
He was there talking about proposed developments of the system which you, of course, took with a grain of salt until such time as they had been produced?---Oh no, it made me feel more comfortable that the projections that I had prepared which when I looked at them from an investor's point of view, were quite satisfactory.
All I was hearing now was better news but I thought no more of it other than that.
"
 

71 The notes are almost entirely silent on matters which could be said to be related either to Parker's projections or to Bell's confirmation of their reasonableness.
Parker nonetheless claims he provided Bell with copies of them and that the detail of items in them were discussed.
He did, though, make the following acknowledgement in cross-examination by counsel for Sladojevic:
 
 "You have got no note that Bell confirmed the accuracy of your projection?---No, I don't but that doesn't mean that he didn't.
I don't have a habit of noting absolutely everything that takes place in a meeting, bearing in mind this was a meeting at which we were discussing financial projections and we went down the various items composed in that, more particularly the profit and loss.
Do you have a note in relation to that?---No.
You are telling us that the confirmation of the financial projections was the prime purpose of the attendance?---It was my primary purpose of coming to Adelaide, yes.
You don't have any note of Bell confirming the accuracy of your projection?---No, I don't.
"
 

72 Parker equally has said in his affidavit that Sladojevic stated that the projections actually underestimated what was achievable.
For his part Sladojevic denies having said this.
He equally denies that the projections were tabled or discussed at the meeting.
Murabito in contrast said that Parker discussed the projections with Bell while he was more in discussion with Sladojevic about the technology and its applications.
Sladojevic confirmed that Bell and he were engaged in separate conversations.
73 Notwithstanding the applicants' pleading that misrepresentations were made as to an investment in the Tiltform group being a secure investment (Sladojevic) and as to the commercial viability of claims made by the Tiltform group as to the proposed investment in Tiltform WA (Sladojevic and Bell), neither of these loomed large in the evidence or in the applicants' submissions.
They were not put explicitly and unequivocally to either respondent.
Rather the applicants now contend that this meeting had "limited significance", this being that it showed that Parker was carrying out a "due diligence process" and that Sladojevic and Bell engaged with him in that process.
This last is relied upon in aid of the applicants' distinct claim that Sladojevic and Bell conducted themselves as promoters.
Findings and Conclusions on the 2 June meeting 
 
74 I am not satisfied that the alleged misrepresentations were made.
And I do not understand the applicants to be now relying upon them to establish their claims.
As to the evidentiary use which they now seek to make of the meeting itself, I agree with their submission that the meeting has limited significance.
The evidence given in relation to it is far from satisfactory.
I do not consider that Bell has any independent recollection of what transpired at this meeting: cf my comments upon him as a witness.
I equally do not consider Murabito's evidence to be reliable.
75 I am satisfied that Parker's primary reason for attending the meeting was as he suggested, i.e.
to have confirmed the reasonableness of his projections.
Given the very limited information to which he had access when he prepared them, it was understandable that he would seek such confirmation and from Sladojevic and his accountant.
While I am satisfied that he discussed those projections with Bell --- and to this extent reject both Bell's and Sladojevic's evidence --- I am not satisfied that he did so in real detail.
I consider that Parker's evidence to the contrary is unreliable and was probably a reconstruction elicited by the form of the cross-examination on that very matter.
I equally am satisfied that he derived some reassurance about the investment from the meeting, but that Sladojevic's explanations of the technology, its applications and prospects contributed significantly to this.
I do not consider that the absence of reference to the projections in Parker's notes is significant in this particular instance.
2.
PERTH: 23-26 JUNE 2000 
 
76 Having returned to Perth after the 2 June meeting, Parker had discussions with the directors of Icon Group and with other business associates who, collectively, were potential investors in Tiltform WA.
By 12 June 2000 the funds required to acquire the 72 per cent interest had been raised.
The participants were to be Rawley Pty Ltd ($100,000), Icon Group directors ($175,000), Airport Consulting Pty Ltd ($75,000) and Connoisseur Holding ($225,000).
These I will refer to as the WA investors.
On the same day Murabito wrote separately to the directors of Tiltform WA and to Barone accepting their respective offers to sell shares to these investors.
The agreement with Barone (which also involved discharging a debt of $70,000 owed to him by Ilic and an agreement by Ilic in turn to repay that amount to the investors) would result in his original $225,000 funding arrangement being paid out.
It was envisaged by the Investors that a unit trust ("the Tiltform Unit Trust") would provide the vehicle for their investment.
Arrangements were then made to meet with Tiltform WA's solicitors to formalise the share transaction.
A meeting to that end was held on 22 June 2000.
77 Between 23 and 27 June Sladojevic, Bell and Benson each spent some time in Perth.
The dates of their so doing (in the cases of Bell and Benson) and their respective reasons for their so doing are disputed.
Meetings were conducted between variously one or more of Sladojevic, Bell and Benson, the directors of Tiltform WA, the Icon Group directors and (on 26 June) Parker.
These resulted in the emergence of a new proposal which was put to the Icon Group and Parker at a meeting on 26 June.
This was that the WA investors (who at that time probably were taken by Bell and Sladojevic to be simply the Icon Group) would take an interest in Tiltform Australia and Tiltform Australia would take over Tiltform WA.
It was at the 26 June meeting that the two misrepresentations (one by Bell, one by Sladojevic) are alleged to have been made.
78 The evidence as to what transpired over this period is marked by sharp contradictions.
To understand these I will deal first with the questions of when and why Sladojevic, Bell and Benson were in Perth.
By way of backdrop to this I would emphasise that at the beginning of this four day period it was the understanding of the WA investors that they had committed themselves to an investment in Tiltform WA and that an investment in Tiltform Australia had not been canvassed.
Sladojevic, Bell and Benson in Perth 
 
79 It is convenient to deal first with Benson .
He gave contradictory evidence as to why he went to Perth.
In his affidavit he states he attributed his trip to Perth to the suggestion of Sladojevic that he meet the investors who were looking to buy into Tiltform WA.
Sladojevic denied this was the case in cross-examination.
In Benson's cross-examination, he said he was in Perth to look at a trade show that Tiltform WA was putting on in its warehouse.
He went to the show "by arrangement" (seemingly with Ilic); Sladojevic was there; and he was then told of the WA investors in Tiltform WA.
It is unnecessary for me to make a positive finding about this matter, but I would indicate that the latter explanation for his trip probably is closer to what occurred than the former which I disbelieve.
What is clear is that Benson left Perth on 25 June 2000.
I say this so as to emphasise he was not at the 26 June meeting at which, as I find, a proposal under his name was distributed.
80 Bell .
His evidence, supported by his office time-sheets, is that he was in his Adelaide office until 1.30 pm on 24 June.
He flew to Perth on Sunday 25 June arriving late in the afternoon and he returned to Adelaide on 27 June.
He said the purpose of his trip was to inspect the books of Tiltform WA to confirm the royalty payment that "we were due to receive", as also to facilitate the process of dealing with the change of the owners.
Bell's positive disclaimer that he was in Perth on 24 June contradicts the contrary evidence of Sladojevic, Lee, Benson and Murabito.
In relation to this matter I consider Bell's time-sheets are more likely to provide guidance as to his whereabouts than the evidence of those I have just listed.
81 Sladojevic .
The evidence of Sladojevic is that he was asked by Ilic to come to Perth to meet a Mia Sarich who was a potential investor in Tiltform WA.
Sladojevic gave evidence of two meetings with Sarich.
The first was on the afternoon of 23 June at which Benson, Ilic and Barone were present.
Murabito is said to have arrived at the warehouse but, on seeing Sarich there, waited outside until Sarich left.
Sladojevic said they did not get on.
Murabito denies he was at the premises on that day and that he first met Benson the following day (i.e.
24 June).
Benson had no reliable recollection of a meeting on 23 June, although he accepted there was such a meeting, albeit with Ilic and Sladojevic.
He gave contradictory evidence about Murabito's presence.
He did not suggest Sarich was there.
Nonetheless, he accepted he was at a meeting which had been arranged the previous night on 24 June at which Murabito, amongst others, was present.
None of Sarich, Ilic or Jennings gave evidence in these proceedings.
82 The second claimed meeting with Sarich is said to have occurred at dusk on 25 June at a restaurant at which Benson and his wife, Bell, Ilic, Jennings, Sarich and Sarich's uncle were present.
Bell's evidence-in-chief was that he had a "quiet dinner" that night with Sladojevic, Barone and Ilic "because we had a busy day coming up the next day".
In cross-examination he gave evidence that he had dinner with Sladojevic and Murabito and that he only heard of the possibility of a separate investor on the morning of 26 June where Sladojevic told him that the Sarich group had dropped out.
It was Benson's evidence that his wife was not with him on this trip to Perth and, as I earlier indicated, that he returned to Adelaide on 25 June though he could not recall at what time.
He did not recall doing anything prior to his departure.
Again Sladojevic's evidence is without corroboration and conflicts with that of Bell and Benson.
83 In the above circumstances, and for the reasons I gave earlier as to my view of the reliability of Sladojevic's evidence, I am not prepared to accept either that these two meetings with Sarich occurred or that he went to Adelaide for the reason he gave.
I do not venture a view as to what his actual reason was.
84 In view of what I have said about the alleged meeting of 23 June, I am unprepared to make any findings as to whether a meeting or meetings were held on that day or as to what may have transpired at them.
I emphasise this for this reason.
It was put to Sladojevic in cross-examination that on 24 June, Benson, at Sladojevic's instigation, raised with the "Icon people" the possibility of them investing in Tiltform Australia.
Sladojevic denied this and said: "That was first raised the night before [i.e.
on the 23 rd ]" and by Murabito.
Murabito has denied this.
85 It is clear that there was a meeting held at the Icon Group offices on 24 June which was attended by Lee, Murabito, Palmiero, Benson, Sladojevic and, probably Ilic and Jennings.
Given my earlier finding, I am satisfied Bell was not present.
That meeting, according to Lee, was concerned with finalising issues and having further discussions concerning the investment in Tiltform WA.
He denied that the question of investing in Tiltform Australia was raised at this meeting let alone that the Icon people indicated they were interested in such a suggestion.
Murabito's evidence, in contrast, was that the Tiltform Australia proposal was raised (he was not sure by whom); it was discussed in some detail; the Icon directors were interested in the proposal for a national licence; and it was indicated that the proposal would have to be discussed with Parker who would not be available until Monday, 26 June.
Parker was in Melbourne.
86 Benson's evidence was that he proposed the Tiltform Australia investment, with that company then taking over Tiltform WA.
He did not believe the ins and outs of the proposal were discussed.
It was "more of a general overview of what my company proposed to do and how their company could benefit by being involved".
He said Ilic and Jennings were keen on the proposal; the Icon Group showed some interest but were not going to proceed without getting input from Parker.
87 Sladojevic's affidavit evidence was broadly consistent with Benson's.
In cross-examination he indicated he had approved the proposal; he regarded the verbal indications from the Icon directors and Ilic and Jennings as confirming the proposal; but he did not recollect it being decided that the parties would meet again on 26 June 2000 when Parker had returned.
His affidavit, to the contrary, records (at par 118 that "a second meeting was arranged for Monday evening at the Icon Group's offices".
In cross-examination he said this was wrong.
I do not accept this retraction.
88 For my own part I am satisfied that, on 24 June 2000, the Tiltform Australia proposal was raised; was discussed in general terms; interest was shown in it; but a follow-up meeting was said to be necessary and was agreed for 26 June in the evening at Icon Group's offices.
I reject Lee's evidence inconsistent with this.
89 It is Bell's evidence that when he arrived in Perth on the evening of 25 June he was told by Sladojevic that:
 
 "Nigel Benson had been and gone and they had done a deal where they were going to roll WA into Tiltform Australia.
"
 

This evidence, which I accept, is of some significance in evaluating the events of the following day.
I will deal with these in two parts: events prior to the 26 June meeting; and the meeting itself.
90 Prior to the 26 June meeting.
Bell gave evidence that he spent the whole of the day of the 26 th at the Tiltform WA factory working in Ilic's office.
He said he briefed Tiltform Licensing's Adelaide solicitor, Richard Solomon, concerning the changes that were happening with the licence agreement and he was going back and forth with Solomon most of the day.
He also looked at the Tiltform WA royalty issues.
Sladojevic was also at the Tiltform WA factory during the day of 26 June.
In cross-examination he indicated he could remember "specific discussion that day with Mr Solomon that Mr Bell had on the phone when I was present with Mr Bell".
I will return to more of Sladojevic's evidence below.
91 To anticipate matters, at the 26 June meeting a document was distributed which was entitled:
 
 "PROPOSAL FOR ACQUISITION OF THE WEST AUSTRALIAN LICENSE FOR THE TILTFORM TECHNOLOGY VIA ACQUISITION OF THE SHAREHOLDING IN TILTFORM CONCRETE FORM SYSTEMS (WA) PTY LTD AS HOLDER OF THE LICENSE RIGHTS TO THE TECHNOLOGY.
"
 

It bore the printed date "25 th June 2000" and purportedly emanated from "Nigel Benson" for Tiltform Australia.
It was unsigned.
Benson disclaims the authorship of the document which, for convenience, I will describe as the "Tiltform Australia proposal".
He, nonetheless, acknowledges that he later made use of it to explain, inter alia, the essence of the proposal to his solicitors and his accountants.
He gave evidence that he would "often" reproduce proposals put forward by Sladojevic that were acceptable to Sladojevic.
92 The proposal commenced with a "Financial Forecast" which stated, inter alia:
 
 "Tiltform Australia expects that by concentrating full-time on two key objectives: establishing fully owned outlets to saturate the capital cities over 3 years; and the sublicensing of operators in minor rural cities and towns, turnover will increase from the present level of $230,000 per annum, to $6,038,000 in the first year, $10,695,000 in the second, and $11,928.000 in the third.
To help achieve this growth, the directors have recognised the need for significant capital injection and the recruitment of competent staff in each of the rental locations.
Establishing one outlet in each of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane each year for 3 years requires total capital of $5,500,000, however the proceeds of sub-license sales in the smaller rural areas and increasing revenue as outlets are established in the CBD and major country regions will fund most of the cost of opening these 9 outlets.
Market penetration using our system within three years is expected to be 60% of all commercial tilt up construction, with additional potential from the housing sector as the development of this is rolled out (the housing market has not been included in the enclosed projections).
"
 (Emphasis added.
)
 

93 It referred to "Financing Requirements (Australia Licences Other Than WA)" noting that:
 
 "The directors have invested considerable funds and other resources into the company.
The total requirements of the company over three years are forecast as:
 
 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3
 
 ...
 
 TOTAL: $2,577,400 $1,400,000 $1,400,000 "
 

94 The proposal detailed the offer being made.
It noted that:
 
 "As discussed with both the Icon and Sarich Groups together with The Head Licensor Mr Robert Sladojevic, We agreed to issue shareholdings in Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd (Our Holding Co. that holds Licenses to all other Australian States and Territories) to either or both the Icon/Sarich Groups.
"
 

The proposal then sought investment of $500,000 by either or both named groups with Tiltform Australia in turn offering to pay both $100 for all of Tiltform WA's shares and $225,000 to pay out Barone's loan to Tiltform WA.
95 It concluded:
 
 "The Settlement of the Proposal would be sequenced as follows so as to protect the interest of every party:
 
 
 
 1) Icon and/or Groups contribute their proportion of funds and are issued with the corresponding shareholding of Tiltform Australia.
2) Once Shareholdings are issued to the groups in Tiltform Australia, Tiltform Australia then acquires 100% of the shareholdings in Tiltform Concrete Form Systems (WA) Pty Ltd.
 
 3) An Agreement in Principle is entered into between all parties confirming that Shares are issued by Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd only on the agreement that it shall proceed with the purchase of 100% of Tiltform (WA) shares for $100.00 and payment to Mr Barone of $225,000 as payment in full for his loan to Tiltform (WA).
4) The allotment of shares in Tiltform Australia and purchase of shares in Tiltform (WA) shall be settled simultaneously during the same settlement.

 
 
 We trust that the following is in line with our discussions and verbal acknowledgements of the proposal.
Accordingly we would appreciate your response to the proposal at the earliest time possible so as to enable preparations for the transaction to proceed.
"
 

96 It is the applicants' case that, absent evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the document is the creature of Bell and Sladojevic.
Bell and Sladojevic deny any involvement in its preparation.
97 There are in evidence two facsimile communications from the solicitor, Richard Solomon, to Bell, one of 26 June 2000 (which was received in Ilic's office by Bell and Sladojevic although Sladojevic said he did not read it); the other, of 27 June but which refers to discussions, etc. of the previous day.
The 26 June facsimile refers to a telephone discussion and instructions received earlier in the day.
The advice it provides (which relates primarily to the alteration and/or preparation of documents and the transfer of shares) was given in light of "commercial discussions [which] are taking place for Tiltform Australia to purchase all or the majority of the shareholding of [Tiltform WA]".
The facsimile contained the caution:
 
 "... your company should not directly involve itself in this transfer of shareholding or in the future issue of shares in Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd other than requiring any future transfer of shareholding/change of directors to be approved by your company.
"
 

I would note in passing that in cross-examination Sladojevic recalled a 26 June telephone warning from Solomon that "[w]e were clearly told not to get involved".
98 More significant for present purposes is the 27 June 2000 facsimile.
It began as follows:
 
 "We refer to our three page facsimile sent to your Adelaide office of yesterday afternoon (and faxed on to yourself) and to our subsequent telephone discussion and further instructions .
(Emphasis added)
 
 We confirm the following, namely:-
 
 
 
 1.
In respect to Tiltform Concrete Form Systems (WA) Pty Ltd ("the WA company") it is proposed that this company sells all of its shareholding to Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd for $100,000, with settlement this coming Friday, 30 June 2000 , Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd simultaneously with the sale would lend to the WA company (which will then be a fully-owned subsidiary of Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd) the sum of $225,000.00 so that the WA company can make payment to Joseph Barone of his loan account of $225,000.00.
Apparently, there is a loan account of Peter Ilic with the WA company for a far lesser sum than the amount of $225,000.00, which loan account is to continue after settlement because Peter Ilic will be purchasing shareholding in Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd (again, simultaneously with settlement on 30 June 2000).

 
 
 
 ...
 
 
 
 4.
We understand that Lee/Parker as one group and another group (you are not sure of the particulars) will each be injecting $500,000.00 into Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd simultaneously with settlement on 30 June 2000, for which each group will receive approximately 15% shareholding in Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd."
 (Emphasis added.
)
 
 

I note in passing that, save for the dates, this facsimile replicates information contained in the Tiltform proposal and it was information communicated by Bell to Richard Solomon.
Given that Bell only arrived in Perth on the evening of 25 June (i.e.
after the 24 June meeting where the deal was "done"), the most likely source of that information was Sladojevic.
99 Despite the evidence of Bell and Sladojevic to the contrary, I infer that Bell, at Sladojevic's direction, composed the Tiltform proposal at Ilic's office prior to the 26 June meeting.
It is probably the case that inaccuracies in the proposal (e.g.
that the Icon Group and Sarich might both invest - Sladojevic knew this would not occur because of mutual animosities) are attributable to Bell having the primary role in composing the document.
As the 27 June facsimile from Richard Solomon indicated, Bell's instructions appear to have conceded he was not "sure of the particulars" relating to who was investing.
I equally find that Benson was willing to, and did, adopt the proposal as Tiltform Australia's from when he became aware of it.
Given his relationship with Sladojevic at the time and the known need for Sladojevic's approvals, I do not find his so acting to be remarkable.
100 The 26 June meeting.
The evidence concerning this matter is both discordant and, in key respects, inconclusive.
Virtually the only matter that is not controversial is that Murabito cooked a meal for those who attended.
Indeed both Bell and Sladojevic sought in oral evidence to give the gathering the character of a get together for a meal.
101 As I have already found, this meeting was one agreed to at the 24 June meeting.
Its purpose was to have Parker involved in discussing any proposed investment in Tiltform Australia.
I reject Bell's insistence that the gathering at the Icon Group offices was not, and was not intended to be, a "formal meeting".
Bell was not present at the 24 June meeting.
His distinction between "formal" and "informal" meetings was neither convincing nor apt in the circumstances.
102 As to the persons who attended, I have already found that Benson left Perth on 25 June 2000.
He did not attend this meeting.
Parker arrived late to the meeting.
His evidence was that he had "no idea" as to its purpose.
The other attendees, Sladojevic and Bell apart, were Lee, Murabito, Palmiero and, although they played no significant role, Ilic and Jennings.
103 All of the witnesses, who attended and who gave evidence, with the exception of Bell, confirmed that the Tiltform Australia proposal document was available at the meeting.
Lee's evidence is that Sladojevic presented them with it; Murabito could not remember how it came to be there; it was there when Parker arrived late; Sladojevic originally attributed its distribution to Benson (see below) but having recanted this as "reconstruction" (having heard Benson's evidence), he said he had no independent recollection of it being distributed; and Bell denied it was there, though he did give evidence of an envelope being there that he or Sladojevic was to take to Adelaide for Benson.
Sladojevic disputed the envelope evidence.
I would note as well that Sladojevic's counsel in final submissions suggested it would be a reasonable conclusion to find that the proposal may have been distributed by Ilic at Benson's request.
Ilic was not called to give evidence in Sladojevic's case.
104 I find that the proposal document was available at the meeting and was discussed.
I infer that it was brought to the meeting by Sladojevic or Bell (and if by the latter, at the former's direction).
In saying this I find that it was prepared in Ilic's office and reproduced there.
105 In his affidavit evidence (which he later retracted in considerable measure as "reconstruction"), Sladojevic assigned Benson a central role in the meeting as the following indicates:
 
 
 "122.1 Benson went though the proposal for investing into the 'national' licensee for the benefit of Parker who was not at the previous meeting.
122.2 Benson handed out copies of a document titled 'Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd --- 25 June 2000 --- Proposal for Acquisition of the West Australian Licence for the Tiltform Technology Via Acquisition of the Shareholding in Tiltform Concrete Form Systems (WA) Pty Ltd as Holder Of The Licence Rights To The Technology' ...
 
 122.3 Parker studied this document and discussed the proposal with the group.
A discussion took place between Benson and Parker concerning the amount of money already invested in Tiltform Australia.
122.4 Benson said at this meeting words to the effect that he and his partner were investing $500,000, and that there was another investor in their group that was looking at investing $500,000.
He added that if the Icon Group and Sarich each invested $500,000, there would be a total of $2 million invested.
Neither Benson nor anyone else said that $2 million had already been raised.
"
 
 

In the face of Benson's evidence, the retraction of the above was made.
106 Having been presented with a copy of the proposal, Parker's affidavit evidence of the meeting was, in part, as follows:
 
 
 "18.
After I had reviewed the Tiltform Australia Proposal, I was comfortable with its terms and conditions, with one exception.
The one thing of which I was unsure was the ability of TA, as national licensee, to fund the national operation ...
I needed to know how the national operation would overcome a cash flow problem, if it arose, because there was no historical data to proceed with.
There was no equivalent document to that which I had received to assess the position of Tiltform WA as in 'GBP1'.
19.
So, after I had reviewed the Tiltform Australia Proposal, I asked Bell in the course of the ... Meeting if there had been sufficient equity capital raised by TA to fund its operations.
I asked Bell this question because he was an accountant and I could rely upon what he said about the financial position.
Bell replied with words to the effect of 'there is over $2 million already raised without your investment'.
At exactly that point in time, Sladojevic interjected and said, words to the effect 'You blokes don't have to worry about money.
We have already taken care of that and we've got plenty of people who want to invest', and he went on (at length) to say how 'stupid' we would be if we didn't take up the offer contained in the Tiltform Australia Proposal.
Based upon what both Bell and Sladojevic had said, I considered that the raising of money and the honouring of commitments were not going to be a problem for Tiltform Australia.
19A.
I also expressed the view at this meeting that I needed to know whether the return on our investment would be at least as good as our return if we limited ourselves to simply investing in the WA licence.
Obviously the investors to whom I had spoken and had committed funds would need to be consulted if projections indicated a different result.
"
 
 

107 In oral evidence Parker indicated that he understood the proposal came from Benson as it had his name on it.
He later prepared a facsimile to Benson (to be signed by Lee) to indicate interest in the proposal.
He realised it was Benson's company they would be dealing with and in that facsimile he addressed his questions to him (see below).
108 Lee's evidence referred only to the $2 million representation attributed to Bell.
The essence of it is captured in the following short passages of cross-examination by Sladojevic's then counsel (whose questions were premised on Benson's presence at the meeting):
 
 "I suggest that [Parker] raised the question of how much had been invested thus far in Tiltform Australia?---Yes.
...
 
 Was there discussion, to your recollection, about how much had already been invested in Tiltform Australia?---Well, there was a question asked by Parker to which Bell replied that regardless of our investment there was already $2 million raised.
You are quite clear in your mind about that?---Very clear.
Did he say from whom?---No.
...
 
 At the time of this meeting wasn't it your understanding that this document was a proposal from Benson on behalf of Tiltform Australia?---That was our understanding but it was a bit confusing, it was handed out by Sladojevic.
Sladojevic didn't speak about the funding of Tiltform Australia at all at that meeting, did he?---I can't recall whether it was Sladojevic or Bell but it was definitely Bell who mentioned that $2 million had been raised even without our funds.
"
 

109 Murabito's affidavit evidence is that the meeting was held because they wanted Parker "to listen to what Rob and Geoff had to say ... [Greg] asked Geoff how much money Tiltform Australia had raised.
Geoff said that "$2 million has been raised" or "words very similar to that".
In cross-examination he revealed little recall of the detail of the meeting.
He did say Bell referred to "$2 million" which he differently described as "it was mentioned by Geoff Bell that $2 million was going to be raised "; "$2 million has been raised " and "Bell then said $2 million is being raised by others ".
110 Sladojevic, as noted earlier, retracted his affidavit "$2 million" evidence quoted earlier.
His evidence instead was of absence of recall, but also was a denial that $2 million was spoken of as moneys already invested in Tiltform Australia.
Bell strenuously denied having made the representation attributed to him.
This was consistent with his further denial that the meeting was a meeting as such.
Bell gave general evidence in cross-examination relating to his views of capital raising by Tiltform Australia and of Benson.
I note the following:
 
 "Weren't you having continuous discussions with Mr Benson on the topic of his getting investors?---No, nothing to do with Tiltform Licensing whatsoever at any stage.
So do you deny that you had any discussions with Mr Benson on the topic of his getting investors?---Yes, I do.
In fact, it was very much the opposite case.
We could never find out from Benson what was going on.
What were you trying to find out from Benson so far as what was going on?---Well, we naturally wanted to know what he was doing about raising capital.
Well, that is what I am asking, Mr Bell.
I am putting to you that you were continuously having discussions with Mr Benson on the topic of prospective investors - - -?---Not at all.
There's a difference between being actively involved in promoting investors in Tiltform Australia and asking the principal of the company what they are doing about raising capital.
...
 
 Do I understand that you were not having any doubts in June 2000 about them being able to get their money together?---Correct.
I had no doubts about that.
You had no doubts?---Because they had already brought in Ben Abraham.
Nigel Benson was the last under way with his licences and his investment group and they had --- the WA group had started to move forward with the change of ownership there with the new WA owners, and the two came together at the one time and so - - -
 
 So you had no concerns in June about sufficient capital being raised?---No.
"
 

111 My own views as to this meeting are as follows.
I am satisfied that after reading the Tiltform Australia proposal, Parker did question Bell on the company's capital raising --- the opening paragraphs of the proposal quoted above invited such questioning.
In the context of that meeting and given that Tiltform Licensing both was the licensor of the company making the proposal and had to approve it, Bell was the appropriate person to whom to address such a question.
I equally am satisfied that the sum of $2 million was referred to by Bell in ensuing discussion.
I would observe in passing that, before his recant, even Sladojevic was prepared to acknowledge that reference was made to such a figure, though by Benson, not Bell.
Consistently with my findings as to Bell's role in the preparation of the proposal, I do not accept Bell's evidence concerning the meeting.
It was self serving and contrived.
Bell, understandably, sought to minimise the significance that ought be given the meeting.
Sladojevic's evidence, considered in the context of his recant, was unreliable.
The actual substance of Bell's representation is less easily identified.
Again given the context in which Parker asked the question, Bell's reference to $2 million probably expressly excluded the potential WA investment.
Such is Lee's evidence.
On the question whether the $2 million had already been raised, as distinct from was going to be, or would be raised, Murabito's evidence is equivocal.
Parker and Lee are definite.
The most that can be derived from Murabito's evidence is that Bell made some reassuring comment about the raising of (actual or prospective) $2 million.
While Parker is definite that Bell said the money had been raised, I entertain some concern as to whether this in fact occurred and that, rather, it was something which Parker and for that matter Lee subsequently came to believe was said.
Nonetheless, despite my misgivings, I accept that a representation such as Parker alleged was made and was false --- I do not say knowingly false --- at the time it was made, although I am satisfied that Bell had no reasonable grounds for making the representation.
112 I am less certain as to the significance it had in its setting, as I will later indicate, given Parker's subsequent inquiries concerning Tiltform Australia's equity capital.
I equally accept that the representation was a quite unusual one for Bell to make in the business setting in which it was made.
I am, though, satisfied that all concerned were at this time infused with enthusiasm for the technology and the potential it offered and were optimistic about capital raising prospects.
113 I equally am satisfied that at that meeting Sladojevic made reassuring comments concerning Tiltform Australia's position and the proposed investment, and he adverted to the interest being shown by others in investing.
What he said was probably to the effect of the evidence given by Parker in his affidavit and, to the extent that it was taken as confirmation of what Bell had represented, it was false and Sladojevic had no reasonable grounds for providing that information.
I should observe that the representations attributed to Sladojevic save for the 7 August letter, did not loom large in the evidence or in submissions.
As I will later indicate they are of little consequence in this proceeding.
114 In making the above finding concerning Sladojevic --- and for that matter the earlier finding concerning Bell --- I am rejecting the evidence of both of them, not only in relation to the alleged representations, but also in relation to their professed lack of any knowledge (which I do not accept for reasons which will become apparent) of the financial circumstances of Tiltform Australia, of its fund raising activities and of those making exertions for its benefit.
115 Notwithstanding my findings, as I will indicate below, I do not consider that these representations were of any lasting significance, if they were of any significance at all.
3.
26 JUNE --- 17 JULY 
 
116 There are four distinct matters to which reference should be made.
The first relates to what can be described as the follow-up to the Tiltform Australia proposal; the second, the advent of John Dawkins as chairman of Tiltform Australia; third, the 12 July "BDO projections" produced for Tiltform Australia; and fourth, Tiltform Australia's fund raising activities.
(i) The follow-up to the proposal 
 
117 The 26 June meeting produced immediate responses.
Parker, apparently on the same night, authored two documents for signature by others.
The first was in the form of a letter to Benson.
It referred to the "Proposal dated 25 June 2000" and it indicated that the signatories were "extremely interested in pursuing further discussions to progress taking us towards the result envisaged by such Proposal".
The designated signatories were Murabito "on behalf of The Icon Group", Ilic "on behalf of himself and Tiltform [WA]" and Jennings "on behalf of himself".
The document in evidence was signed only by Murabito and Ilic.
It was put to Benson that the original was faxed to him.
He had no memory of receiving it.
118 The second and more significant "Parker document" was a letter signed by Lee on behalf of Icon and faxed to Benson on or about the date it bore of 27 June.
As will be noted below, Benson later supplied some of the information sought in this letter.
The letter reiterated what was said in the first Parker document; it asked for clarification of "several issues"; and sought Benson's "assistance in providing the relevant information".
The first of these related to "Financial Forecast".
After referring to the projections Parker had made for the Tiltform WA proposal, it asked whether Benson was able to provide similar, detailed projections "which expand on the numbers you have used when referring to projected turnover and financing requirements so that we may relate the return on investment from Tiltform Australia to that envisaged from our investment in Tiltform WA".
The second related to "Shareholding".
It noted that what would be taken was a "minority shareholding".
And it asked to be provided with a copy of the company's Constitution, any Shareholders' Agreement and details of the differences, if any, between classes of shares.
It went on to deal, thirdly, with "Board Representation", fourthly, with the management of the WA operation and, finally, with settlement.
119 Benson replied by email on 6 July.
He indicated that they were re-evaluating their forecasts; discussions with "a very high profile ex federal minister have resulted in him unofficially joining the group as chairman"; and he added: "I don't need to tell you how this profile will add credibility to Tiltform Australia along with instantly raising the value of the company".
Lee phoned Benson in relation to the email.
The notes made on the email of that conversation included: "concerned about manufacturing capacity"; "reiterated we are 100% roring (sic) to go"; and "new figures here on Monday".
120 Benson in turn by email sought to explore whether Lee was prepared to offer a $150,000 refundable deposit "to enable both parties to further cement relations".
Lee ignored this.
On 10 July Benson sent a facsimile to Lee providing "details as per your request".
The company's constitution was provided.
It was noted that "shareholders rights have been explored ... for a view to the future and possible overseas investment and expansion into Asia".
It also indicated that "P  L --- Cashflow etc still not correct".
Benson expected to send them the following day.
They were provided on 12 July: see the 12 July BDO projections below.
121 On 11 July Benson sent a letter to Lee in which, in response to the 27 June letter, he said there was no shareholders' agreement and the shares were all to be ordinary shares.
As to board representation, he commented that he intended to have a maximum of seven members and indicated:
 
 "Your group can hold two positions on the board until such time as the other shareholder positions are filled.
The reason for this is as explained previously, and that is the anticipated move into the Asian region will involve our joint venture partner becoming involved in the Australian holding company prior to our joint venture expansion into Asia.
"
 

122 Finally he noted that:
 
 "Negotiation with another two investors are nearing completion and I am hopeful that they will commit once our new prospectus document is completed.
(expected by Friday this week)"
 

123 Parker's oral evidence was that Benson's response to the 27 June letter was unsatisfactory.
I consider this to be a judgment subsequently made.
He did not, though, have any telephone discussions with Benson prior to receiving the 12 July projections.
(ii) John Dawkins 
 
124 While there is some uncertainty in the evidence as to when, how and by whom the first contacts were made with Dawkins, it seems clear that he met and had discussions with Sladojevic and Bell at the beginning of July 2000; he was asked whether he would be interested in being the independent chairman of Tiltform Australia; there was also discussion with them about whether he could introduce them to people who might be interested in putting equity capital into the business.
Dawkins later met Benson.
On 7 July, Benson sent him an email seeking that he accept the position of chairman.
Dawkins replied on 19 July indicating that "[s]ubject to my being satisfied with your capital structure, I would be happy to be involved as you propose".
125 In oral evidence Dawkins indicated that the capital structure of Tiltform Australia was "always the problem".
Both he and Sladojevic agreed that even with the contribution from the West Australians, there was a need to secure other financing, "either equity or debt".
Dawkins observed that while he did not discuss with Benson how the equity capital position was advancing in the first months of his involvement, he did with Sladojevic.
He said he did mention a couple of names to Bell and Sladojevic of people who might be approached for equity capital and he mentioned a Mr Krogan of Elderslie Finance which had a specialist lease financing business for debt capital.
He was not involved directly in discussions with the persons named.
As Dawkins said: "I made some suggestions.
It was up to [Bell and Sladojevic] to carry forward those negotiations".
I would note in passing that Elderslie Finance was a subsidiary of a company of which Dawkins was a director.
126 I will return to Dawkins below.
There is, though, one matter which can conveniently be dealt with at this point although it is only tangentially related to Dawkins.
On 5 July (i.e.
after at least Bell and Sladojevic, but also probably Benson, had had discussions with Dawkins) a meeting was held which, according to Bell's handwritten notes, was attended by Bell, Simon Abraham (whose company BDO (SA) Pty Ltd was Tiltform Australia's accountant), Nigel Benson and a Ms O'Boyle.
Bell had no independent recollection of the meeting.
Abraham had no notes of it and, while not disputing that the meeting occurred, had no recollection of what was discussed there even after reading Bell's notes.
While I am not prepared to speculate as to what precisely the notes conveyed --- Bell's interpretation of them was not reliable and was not pursued in cross-examination --- the notes at least indicate discussions were had about Tiltform Australia's capital, the composition of the board and of the expectations someone present had of Dawkins as a funds raiser.
While the purpose of the meeting is unclear, what I consider it does at least reveal is that at the time it occurred Bell was participating in a discussion about the internal management and affairs of Tiltform Australia.
(iii) The 12 July BDO projections 
 
127 The first version of the projections for Tiltform Australia that Benson had been foreshadowing to Lee was provided on 12 July 2000 ("the 12 July BDO projections").
They took the form of profit and loss, cash flow and balance sheet forecasts for 2000-2001, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 financial years.
The monthly forecast for July and August 2000 in the Cash Flow Forecast made provision for "capital inflows" of $475,000 and $500,000 respectively and for none thereafter in that financial year.
Parker interpreted the $500,000 as being that of his WA investors.
The entry for loan capital was limited to $390,000 in July 2000, this figure representing vendor financing by Tiltform Licensing.
The Cash Flow Forecast revealed a sharply declining bank balance from August 2000 until February 2001 beginning with $241,515 and ending with $15,901 (December) and $17,601 (January).
The Balance Sheet Forecast identified that $310,000 had been raised as share capital prior to 30 June 2000.
128 In his affidavit Parker indicated that in his review of the 12 July projections he became alarmed that the projected capital inflow did not reflect the equity capital of $2 million "that Bell and Sladojevic had categorically stated had already been raised".
In consequence, Tiltform Australia's closing cash at bank was extremely "thin" up until January 2001.
He identified what he described as a "black hole" during the first seven months of trading where it was obvious that additional funds would be required to pay the outgoings of the rapidly expanding business.
That "hole" he considered would have been filled by the injection of an additional $500,000 of equity capital.
129 After discussing the projections with Lee that day, Parker prepared a letter to Benson for Lee to sign.
That letter indicated that the Tiltform Australia proposal continued to represent "a very viable alternative to the agreements we were in the process of finalising".
It went on, insofar as presently relevant:
 
 "A review of the documents you have sent over has identified several areas which we feel need some attention --- not from the point of view of our group making its investment in Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd --- but more so being of the nature of strategic planning issues.
The areas we wish to work with you on are as follows:
 
 1.
WORKING CAPITAL 
 
 
 
 The programmed roll-out of each State and Territory is not able to be gleaned from the financial forecasts provided, however we have observed that the working capital available during the first six months or so is very thin ...
 
 2.
OVERHEADS 
 
 ...
 
 3.
LEASE FACILITY 
 
 We would like to find out about the terms and conditions relative to the leasing facility you have put in place e.g.
total funding limit approved, security, guarantees, indicative rates and any specific lending criteria imposed in the deal.
4.
VENDOR FINANCE 
 
 ...
 
 5.
SHARE CAPITAL 
 
 We would like to make sure that the $475,000 is a guaranteed cash inflow, and there are issues relating the 'prospectus' and the joint venture partner you referred to in your fax dated 11 July 2000 that require clarification.

 
 
 We share in your belief that Tiltform Australia Pty Ltd has the potential to achieve the projected results, and we believe that with our commitment to working with you and other members of the management team these results will be achieved.
Rather than embark upon a fresh series of telephone calls, faxes and emails we feel that the above issues are more expediently dealt with by meeting with you (probably in the next few days) to ensure that our involvement proceeds within the timeline set out in your projections.
"
 

130 Notwithstanding that the Bell "$2 million statement" was not reflected in the projections, Parker acknowledged he did not make explicit reference to this in the letter.
Neither did he seek to contact Bell about the projections or, for that matter, Sladojevic.
As he said in cross-examination:
 
 "---I was dealing with Tiltform Australia.
And it was your understanding, at that time, that Tiltform Australia was Benson's company; yes?---It was Benson's proposal.
Benson's company, Benson's proposal - - - ?---Yes and it was Benson's company.
And it was up to him to arrange the investors?---Yes, it was.
And that always remained your understanding from that time on, didn't it?---After having read what Sladojevic said and Bell said on the 26 th , what I was looking for was that funding had been confirmed .
I was looking for it from Benson and I wasn't getting the answers".
(Emphasis added.
)
 

131 Lee then made arrangements with Benson to travel to Adelaide with Parker for a meeting on 17 July.
He said in his affidavit that the meeting was to be with Sladojevic and Bell.
Parker said it was with Benson.
Lee accepted in cross-examination that in the various telephone discussions he had with Benson prior to 17 June, he did not mention the equity capital that Bell was alleged to have spoken about.
He said this was a financial matter; "[Parker] was looking after all financial issues".
I would interpolate this was a constant refrain in Lee's oral evidence.
132 Parker and Benson arrived in Adelaide on 16 July.
They dined with Benson and his wife that evening.
This was the first occasion on which Parker and Benson had met.
133 Despite Lee's view as to the purpose of the meeting, it is clear that it was intended to be only with Benson.
This said, both Bell and Sladojevic (though he arrived late) attended it.
It is unnecessary to attempt to unravel what their respective particular reasons may have been for being there.
I would merely say I do not accept that they attended for reasons of courtesy and to welcome visitors.
(iv) Raising of loan capital 
 
134 On 13 July 2000, Benson, Lee, Sladojevic, Bell and Simon Abraham met Joe Krogan of Elderslie Finance to discuss proposed funding arrangements.
Both Abraham and Bell kept notes of the meeting.
From Abraham's note it seems that the meeting, which Bell says took place over five hours, addressed both the Tiltform system itself, its cost, the cost of the Australian roll-out and investment by Elderslie in the funding of the roll-out.
Amongst other things Abraham noted:
 
 "$7m in formwork to do Aust
 
 Money Back in 4 months.
"
 

Bell's notes refer to "Leasing facility" and "Capital Raising".
He was not asked to explain the figures in his notes which appear to refer to sums in the order of $8 million.
In his evidence Sladojevic said he was there simply to describe the technology.
He explained that the "money back" reference in Abraham's notes meant that if you hired out a set of formwork four times in four months you would generate hire income to the value of the formwork itself.
135 A "Lease facility" was referred to in the 12 July BDO projections.
Lee gave evidence that he was told by Benson prior to the 17 July meeting of approaches to Elderslie Finance about a proposed $8 million lease facility.
When asked why they needed a lease facility having regard to his belief that there was already $2 million raised, Lee replied:
 
 "It was whether to spend all that money on capital items, or whether it is worth with that money in the bank being able to arrange a lease facility.
"
 

136 I will return below to discussion of this lease facility at the 17 July meeting.
To anticipate a related matter, on 24 August 2000 (several weeks after the Western Australians invested in Tiltform Australia) Elderslie Finance declined the proposed facility.
4.
THE 17 JULY MEETING 
 
137 On the trip from Perth, Parker and Lee prepared on a laptop what Parker described as "an agenda, a script that we could follow and make sure that we covered all the issues that remained to be answered".
Printouts of it were produced in Bell's office.
