 
1 This case is concerned with the ascertainment of the date upon which a particular 'favourable determination' within the meaning of s 108 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 (Cth) ('the Administration Act'), in relation to a partner allowance, took effect (see also ss 78, 109 and 114 cf ss 771NL and 771NR of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) ('the Social Security Act ')).
2 Prior to 20 March 2000 the Social Security Act dealt with both entitlements to social security payments and also the administration of claims for such payments.
On 20 March 2000 the main operative provisions of the Administration Act commenced whereupon the Social Security Act continued to deal with the question of entitlements, but the Administration Act replaced the Social Security Act as the relevant enactment dealing with the administration of claims for such payments.
Transitional and savings provisions were contained in Part 8 of the Administration Act (see in particular ss 246 --- 248).
3 At all material times for the purposes of this case there were seven categories of social security payment.
The expression ' social security payment ' was defined in s 23 of the Social Security Act .
One such category was:
 
 '(b) a social security benefit; ...' 


 
4 There were some ten categories of social security benefit.
The expression ' social security benefit ' was defined in s 23 of the Social Security Act .
One such category was:
 
 '(e) partner allowance; ...' 
 

5 As at 15 December 1999 Chapter 2 of the Social Security Act dealt with ' Pensions, Benefits and Allowances '.
The several Parts within Chapter 2 had the following headings:
 
 ' Part 2.1 --Introduction 
 Part 2.2 --Age pension 
 Part 2.2A --Pension bonus 
 Part 2.3 --Disability support pension 
 Part 2.4 --Wife pension 
 Part 2.5 --Carer payment 
 Part 2.7 --Bereavement allowance 
 Part 2.8 --Widow B pension 
 Part 2.8A --Widow allowance 
 Part 2.10 --Parenting payment 
 Part 2.11 --Youth allowance 
 Part 2.11A --Austudy payment 
 Part 2.12 --Newstart allowance 
 Part 2.12A --Mature age (pre---1 July 1996) allowances 
 Part 2.12B --Mature age (post---30 June 1996) allowance 
 Part 2.13 --Employment entry payment 
 Part 2.13A --Education entry payment 
 Part 2.14 --Sickness allowance 
 Part 2.15 --Special benefit 
 Part 2.15A --Partner allowance 
 Part 2.16 --Special needs pensions 
 Part 2.17 --Family allowance 
 Part 2.17AA --Family tax payment 
 Part 2.17A --Maternity allowances 
 Part 2.19 --Child disability allowance 
 Part 2.20 --Double orphan pension 
 Part 2.21 --Mobility allowance 
 Part 2.22 --Advance payments of social security entitlements 
 Part 2.23 --Advance pharmaceutical allowance 
 Part 2.24 --Disaster relief payment 
 Part 2.24A --Pensioner education supplement 
 Part 2.25 --Telephone allowance 
 Part 2.26 --Fares allowance ' 

It will be seen that Part 2.15A dealt with 'Partner allowance'.
6 Chapter 2A dealt with ' Benefits and Concessions other than Payments '.
7 Chapter 3 dealt with ' General Provisions Relating to Payability and Rates '.
It contained a series of parts commencing with ' Part 3.1 --- Rate Calculators (General)'.
8 Part 3.6 of Chapter 3 of the Social Security Act had a heading ' Benefit Rate Calculator B ', which was relevant for the purpose of quantifying partner allowances.
It included a series of 'Modules' with the following headings:
 
 ' Module A---Overall Rate Calculation Process 
 Module B---Maximum Basic Rate 
 Module D---Pharmaceutical Allowance 
 Module F---Rent Assistance 
 Module G---Income Test 
 Module J---Remote Area Allowance ' 
 
 Calculation of the rate of benefit in respect of partner allowance 
 
9 In relation to the calculation of rates at which social security benefits are properly paid, one should go in the first instance to s 1062(1) of the Social Security Act , which provided as follows:
 
 
 
 '1062(1) The following are the usual steps in the rate calculation process: 
 
 
 
 (a) start with a maximum basic rate; 
 (b) add any additional amounts that are subject to income or assets testing; 
 (c) apply the income and assets tests; 
 (d) add any additional amounts that are not subject to income or assets testing.

 
 
 
 (2) The overall rate calculation process is usually described in an early Module of the relevant Rate Calculator.
' 
 
 
 
 

10 Specific provision was made for the calculation of the rate of partner allowance in s 1068 of the Social Security Act , which relevantly provided as follows:
 
 '1068(1) The rate of: 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 (c) partner allowance; 
 
 
 
 is to be calculated in accordance with the Rate Calculator at the end of this section; ...' 
 
 
 

(see also s 771KA of the Social Security Act )
 
11 The Rate Calculator at the end of s 1068 of the Social Security Act was described as ' Benefit Rate Calculator B '.
The process to be undertaken was specified in ' Module A --- Overall Rate Calculation Process' which was expressed as follows:
 
 '1068-A1 The rate of benefit is a fortnightly rate.

 
 
 
 
 Method statement 
 
 Step 1.

 
 Work out the person's maximum basic rate using MODULE B below.

 
 Step 2.

 
 Work out the amount per year (if any) of pharmaceutical allowance using MODULE D below.

 
 Step 3.

 
 Work out the applicable amount (if any) for rent assistance (using MODULE F).

 
 Step 4.

 
 Add up the amounts obtained in Steps 1 to 4 [sic] : the result is called the maximum payment rate .

 
 Step 5.

 
 Apply the income test using MODULE G below to work out the income reduction.

 
 Step 6.

 
 Take the income reduction away from the maximum payment rate: the result is called the provisional payment rate .

 
 Step 7.

 
 The rate of benefit is the difference between: 
 (a) the provisional payment rate; and 
 
 (b) any advance payment deduction (see Part 3.16A) ; 
 
 plus any amount payable by way of remote area allowance (see MODULE J below).
' 
 

 
12 As can be seen from Module A, the rate of a partner allowance benefit is to be ascertained by undertaking a series of mathematical exercises identified in steps 4, 6 and 7.
The ascertainment of an applicable amount for rent assistance is but one of the steps in the calculation process.
The Social Security Act does not recognise rent assistance as a discrete category of social security benefit.
13 The several paragraph headings in Module F --- Rent Assistance were 'Rent assistance', 'Rent threshold rate', 'Partner with rent increased pension', 'Age test applies to some people', 'Parent', 'Factors affecting rate of rent assistance', 'Partner with rent increased benefit', 'Rate of rent assistance', 'Fortnightly rent', 'Rent paid by a member of a couple' and 'Rent paid by a member of an illness separated couple'.
14 Paragraph 1068 --- F1 of the Rent Assistance Module provided for a rent assistance component to be taken into account in the partner allowance rate of benefit calculation process, as required by step 3, if some eight criteria were satisfied.
The preamble to those criteria was expressed as follows:
 
 
 
 '1068-F1 Subject to points 1068-F3 and 1068-F4, an amount to help cover the cost of rent is to be added to a person's maximum basic rate for a period if: 
 ...' 
 
 
 
 
 Claims for partner allowance 
 
15 As at 15 December 1999 s 771IA et seq of the Social Security Act made provision for the making of claims for a partner allowance.
Section 771IA(1) provided:
 
 
 
 '771IA(1) A person who wants to be granted a partner allowance must make a proper claim for that allowance.
' 
 
 


(the comparable provision of the Administration Act under which claims for a partner allowance may be made is now s 11(1))

 Determination of claims for partner allowance 
 
16 Under s 771JA the Secretary to the Department was required to 'determine the claim' (see now s 36(1) of the Administration Act).
Under s 1299 it was open to the Secretary to delegate most of his powers under the Social Security Act to Departmental officers (see now s 234 of the Administration Act) and such delegations led to primary determinations of claims for partner allowance being made by such officers.
17 Generally speaking, when a person's claim for a partner allowance is granted, the relevant commencement or start day is the day on which the claim for the partner allowance is made (see s 771HM et seq and s 771JC(1) of the Social Security Act and ss 41 --- 42 together with Schedule 2 clause 3 et seq of the Administration Act).
18 Section 1240 of the Social Security Act made provision for applications to be made to the Secretary for review of the decisions of Departmental officers in respect of claims made under the Social Security Act (the comparable provision is now s 129 of the Administration Act).
Date of effect of review determinations granting claims for partner allowance which were originally rejected 
 
19 In relation to claims for partner allowance that were rejected but later granted as a result of an application for review under s 1240 of the Social Security Act , s 771JC(2) --- (4) contained provisions dealing with the date upon which a determination granting such a claim would take effect (see now s 107 of the Administration Act).
Review of decisions in relation to a person's partner allowance 
 
20 Even in cases where a claim for partner allowance had been granted provision was made in the Social Security Act , and later the Administration Act, for the review of decisions made 'in relation to a partner allowance'.
In the case of 'favourable determinations' made as a result of applications for review of such decisions, s 771NR(2) --- (4) of the Social Security Act made provision for the date upon which those favourable decisions would take effect (see now s 109 of the Administration Act).
21 At first blush, it is difficult to comprehend why a person would seek review of a decision made in relation to a partner allowance where the claim for such an allowance had been granted .
The simple answer is to be found in the identification of what will constitute a 'favourable determination' as a result of an application for review of a decision 'made in relation to a partner allowance' (see ss 771NR(1) and especially 771NL of the Social Security Act and now ss 108 and especially 78 of the Administration Act).
22 Section 771NR(1) and 771NL of the Social Security Act provided as follows:-
 
 
 
 '771NR(1) The date on which a determination under section 771NL or 771NQ (the favourable determination ) takes effect is worked out in accordance with this section.
' 
 
 '771NL If the Secretary is satisfied that the rate at which partner allowance is being, or has been, paid is less than the rate provided for by this Act, the Secretary is to determine that the rate is to be increased to the rate specified in the determination.
' 
 
 
 

23 The provisions in the Administration Act that are comparable with ss 771NR(1) and 771NL are to be found in ss 108 and 78 of the Administration Act, which provided: 
 
 '108 In this Subdivision: 
 
 
 
 favourable determination means a determination under section 78, 85 or 85A.
' 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 '78 If the Secretary is satisfied that the rate at which a social security payment is being, or has been, paid is less than the rate provided for by the social security law, the Secretary must: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) determine that the rate is to be increased to the rate provided for by the social security law; and 
 
 (b) specify the last-mentioned rate in the determination.
' 
 
 


 
24 In relation to the date on which favourable determinations in relation to partner allowance were to take effect s 771NR relevantly provided:
 
 
 
 '771NR(2) If: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a decision (the previous decision ) is made in relation to a partner allowance; and 
 
 (b) a notice is given to the person to whom the allowance is payable advising the person of the making of the previous decision; and 
 
 (c) the person applies to the Secretary under section 1240, within 3 months after the notice is given, for review of the previous decision; and 
 
 (d) a favourable determination is made as a result of the application for review; 
 
 
 
 
 the determination takes effect on the day on which the previous decision took effect.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 771NR(3) If: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a decision (the previous decision ) is made in relation to a partner allowance; and 
 
 (b) a notice is given to the person to whom the allowance is payable advising the person of the making of the previous decision; and 
 
 (c) the person applies to the Secretary under section 1240 more than 3 months after the notice is given, for review of the previous decision; and 
 
 (d) a favourable determination is made as a result of the application for review; 
 
 
 
 
 the determination takes effect on the day on which the person sought the review.

 
 
 
 
 771NR(4) If: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a decision (the previous decision ) is made in relation to a partner allowance; and 
 
 (b) no notice is given to the person to whom the allowance is payable advising the person of the making of the previous decision; and 
 
 (c) the person applies to the Secretary under section 1240 for review of the previous decision; and 
 
 (d) a favourable determination is made as a result of the application for review; 
 
 
 
 
 the determination takes effect on the day on which the previous decision took effect.

 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 771NR(6) In any other case, the favourable determination takes effect on the day on which the determination was made or on such later day or earlier day (not being a day more than 3 months before the determination was made) as is specified in the determination.
