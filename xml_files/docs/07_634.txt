 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 These two proceedings were heard together.
As they raise similar principles of law based upon sufficiently common facts, it is convenient to deal with both applications in these reasons, although I will make separate orders in each proceeding.
2 Two decisions made by the respondent pursuant to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) ('the Act') are sought to be reviewed, namely:
 
 (a) a decision made on 21 April 2006 to suspend each applicant's appointment as an inspector ('the suspension decision'); and 
 (b) a decision made on 23 June 2006 to remove each applicant as an inspector ('the removal decision').


3 Each decision was purported to be made in exercise of a power under s 21R of the Act and as a delegate of the relevant Commonwealth minister under s 21B of the Act.
4 To the extent that either applicant requires any extension of time under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) to bring their application, because of the view I finally reach on the merits in this matter, I refuse to grant an extension of time as sought.
I should indicate that if I was persuaded by either applicant on the merits of their applications, I would have granted the extension of time.
THE FACTS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS 
 
5 There was no real dispute about the facts in these proceedings.
