 HIS HONOUR: 
 
1 This case concerns what level of financial "penalty", up to a relatively low limit, it is appropriate for the Court to impose on the Commonwealth for admitted breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 (Cth) ("OHS Act") by the Commonwealth as the deemed employer of a soldier, Trooper Lawrence, who died at the age of 25 in November 1994 in the Northern Territory as a result of heat stress sustained while on an Army promotional training course.
Background 
 
2 Between 4 and 10 November 2004, members of the Australian Defence Force ("ADF"), including Trooper Lawrence, participating in the field phase of a leaders training course known as the Subject 1 for Corporal Course ("Corporal Course"), being conducted at the Mount Bundey Training Area ("Mount Bundey") in the Northern Territory, experienced environmental circumstances giving rise to a risk of heat injury, including heat stroke.
3 By virtue of s 9(2)(b) of the OHS Act , a member of the ADF is, for the purposes of the OHS Act , taken to be employed by the Commonwealth.
Regulation 4 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Regulations 1991 makes the Chief of the Defence Force the employing authority in relation to a member of the Defence Force for the purposes of the Act (see, in particular, s 10).
At all material times, therefore, the respondent is taken to have been the employer of members of the ADF for the purposes of the OHS Act .

 
4 The applicant seeks a declaration of contravention and the imposition of a pecuniary penalty pursuant to the provisions of Sch 2 of the OHS Act .
5 Subsections 11(1) and (3) provide that the OHS Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and that the Commonwealth is subject to proceedings for a contravention of cl 2(1) of Sch 2 and liable to pay a pecuniary penalty under cl 4(l) of that Schedule.
Clause 2(1) of Sch 2 provides:
 
 
 (1) If a court considers that a person has breached one of the following provisions, or was involved in such a breach, it must make a declaration that the person has contravened this subclause: 
 
 (a) subsection 16(1) (duties of employers in relation to their employees etc.)
 
 

6 The applicant alleges that the Commonwealth has breached its obligations under s 16(1) of the OHS Act which provides that: "An employer must take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employer's employees.
"
 
7 The respondent concedes that the circumstances leading up to the death of Trooper Lawrence involved contravention by it of its duty under s 16(1) of the OHS Act .
The ADF's Regional Training Centre in the Northern Territory 
 
8 In 1992 the ADF directed the Army to locate a Brigade in the Darwin area.
This resulted in approximately 1,200 Army personnel moving there.
Mount Bundey was set up to provide training facilities to serve this Brigade.
9 Use of Mount Bundey is managed by the Defence Corporate Support and Information Group, while Training Command - Army provides training services to "client" units of other commands.
Training is undertaken by arrangement with client units according to an Army-wide program by instructors from the Regular Army and Army Reserve.
10 Mount Bundey lies within the coastal monsoon region of Northern Australia.
Its climate therefore has two distinct seasons: a dry season from about May to October; and a wet season from about November to April.
November is generally regarded as still being in the "build up" to the wet season and, until the rains come, a more trying time than the wet season proper.
