 
1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate dated 30 January 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") of 9 February 2006: see [2007] FMCA 75.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent ("the delegate") dated 4 August 2005 to refuse to grant protection visas to the appellants.
2 The appellants are a mother and her two children who entered Australia on 2 June 2005.
They are citizens of Sri Lanka.
They entered on one month visitors' visas.
The first appellant claimed to have been an active supporter of the United National Party ("the UNP") in Sri Lanka and, as a result, had been subjected to harassment and threats by political opponents throughout the 2004 election period.
The first appellant also claimed that one of her children was the victim of an attempted kidnapping and that she believed that the authorities did not act because of her political allegiances.
She alleged that a JVP politician had interfered with the police investigation.
The first appellant's husband now works in the United States of America and the appellant claims that she fears raising her children alone in Sri Lanka.
3 A delegate of the Minister refused the appellant's application for a protection visa and she appealed to the Tribunal.
Prior to the hearing she forwarded written submissions to the Tribunal.
Attached to those submissions were what were said to be copies of two extracts from police information books.
They were written in Sinhalese and had been translated into English.
One referred to a report of the alleged abduction of the appellant's son.
The other referred to an assault allegedly suffered by the appellant's husband.
The first extract was tendered to support the claim that the appellant's son had been kidnapped.
4 The Tribunal accepted certain of the appellant's claims.
However it rejected her claim that an attempt had been made to kidnap her son.
One reason for rejecting the claim was that country information suggested that political violence occurred in Sri Lanka at times when elections were being conducted.
The alleged attempted kidnapping had occurred in February 2005 at which time no elections were taking place.
The Tribunal also expressed doubts about the authenticity of the extracts from police reports but held that, even if they were genuine, they "would only attest to a report being made to a police station and could not represent evidence of the events described therein having occurred.
"
 
5 The Tribunal also held that it could not accept that those who had allegedly caused harm to the appellant were politically motivated.
The Tribunal said:
 
 "The [appellant] has not provided convincing evidence that any harm she claims to have been subjected to was in fact perpetrated by political enemies.
She has made vague connections between the visit by members of the JVP who were clearly on a recruiting/fund raising campaign and the threats over the phone which she claims to have received.
She also indicated that she had received requests for money from many other parties.
The Tribunal accepts that she may have been approached by funds for a number of political parties given the obviously comfortable financial position in which the family is in, it accepts that she may have been threatened for not complying; the nature of these threats over the telephone has not been detailed to the Tribunal.
Even in her own alleged report to the police on the attempted kidnap of her son she states that people are attempting to extort money from her.
There is no mention of a political motive or that the would be perpetrators were political opponents.
The attempt to kidnap her son is said to have occurred almost a year after the said election and the loss of this election by the UNP cited as the reason that the applicant was importuned; both the timing and the reason do not appear likely given that political violence tends to occur around election time; the elections which followed the general elections of 2 April 2004 were the presidential elections of 17 November 2005.
The only indication of presumed political involvement is the original claims by the [appellant] that a certain JVP politician had "interfered with the police investigation".
This claims (sic) was not reiterated at the hearing and does not sit well with the [appellant's] insistence that the police did nothing following any of her complaints.
If there was a police investigation, this indicates that the authorities did take her claims seriously.
The [appellant] has provided no further comment on this presumed political interference.
The Tribunal does not accept that this politician interfered with the police investigation.
" 

6 The first appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates' Court.
She claimed that the Tribunal had erred when considering the authenticity of the police reports used to substantiate the claim that her child was the victim of an attempted kidnapping.
In particular, the first appellant claimed that the Tribunal had not complied with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") by failing to provide her with written notice that a reason for its adverse decision would be her claim that the kidnapping investigation was neglected as a result of her political affiliations.
It was also claimed that the Tribunal had failed to exercise its jurisdiction by not making adequate enquiries as to the validity of the police reports, and did not have sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that they were not genuine.
7 The Federal Magistrate rejected the submission that the Tribunal had erred by failing to meet its obligations under s 424A(1) of the Act .
He held that the appellant's failure to reiterate a claim made at the time of her original application for a protection visa was not "information" for the purposes of s 424A.
He continued:
 
 "[26] I otherwise accept that the Tribunal in any event had not regarded the applicants' failure to reiterate her claim about the JVP politician as part of its reasons for decision.

 
 [27] I am otherwise satisfied that if the reference to the failure to reiterate the claim about the JVP politician could be regarded as information, then it was not made part of the applicant's submissions and accordingly does fall within the exception pursuant to s 424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act .

 
 [28] Ultimately, what has occurred in this instance is that the applicant's claim has been rejected by the Tribunal and as submitted by the first respondent, it cannot be said that a claim that is made and rejected by the Tribunal forms part of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision.
The claim is not the information, according to the first respondent's submissions, but rather it is the information relied upon in rejecting a claim that is relevant.
I accept that submission and, in my view, accordingly this ground should fail.
In reaching that decision, the Court is not assisted by other authorities referred to by counsel during the course of submissions.
The Tribunal in this case is simply noting a failure to reiterate a claim, and that in my view cannot constitute information of a kind which would attract the application of s 424A of the Migration Act .
As indicated, this ground should therefore fail.
" 

8 In dismissing the claim that the Tribunal had failed to properly exercise its jurisdiction in relation to ascertaining the validity of the police reports, the Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal had made a finding that, even if the document was accepted as genuine, that would not necessarily represent evidence of the attempted kidnapping and was ultimately not a significant factor in the Tribunal's decision.
While the Federal Magistrate commented that the Tribunal had dealt with this issue in a "somewhat unsatisfactory manner", his Honour found that the Tribunal "proceeded to make findings where little or no weight was placed upon the police report and other factors were taken into account.
" The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application on 30 January 2007.
9 The notice of appeal filed in this court on 19 February 2007 alleges that the decision of the Federal Magistrate was affected by jurisdictional error and that he ought to have made the following findings:
 
 (a) That the Tribunal denied procedural fairness to the appellant and breached s 424A of the Act by failing to provide particulars of information relied upon when dismissing claims of the attempted kidnapping; 
 (b) That the Tribunal denied procedural fairness to the appellant and breached s 424A of the Act by failing to ensure that the appellant understood that a police report that had been provided would not be accepted as evidence of the attempted kidnapping;
 (c) That the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction by making a finding in relation to the date printed on the police report when there was no evidence to support such a conclusion; and
 (d) That the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction by reaching a conclusion in relation to the police report when expert evidence and translation were required to contradict sworn evidence given at the hearing.


10 At the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellants identified two issues raised by these grounds.
