 
1 On 20 December 2006 I published my reasons for concluding that the defendant should be found guilty on three charges of contempt (see Australian Securities  Investments Commission v Pappas [2006] FCA 1785]).
The present reasons should be understood in the light of and as an extension of those reasons.
On 20 December 2006, I gave directions for the parties to make submissions on the appropriate penalty for contempt.
I have now received written submissions on behalf of the Australian Securities  Investments Commission (the Commission) and the defendant and have heard oral submissions on behalf of both parties on that question.
2 Ordinarily, subject to satisfaction of certain procedural requirements, the Court has power to impose a term of imprisonment, to impose a fine and to make costs orders as punishment for contempt.
