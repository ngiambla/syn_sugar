 
1 This is an application for judicial review of a decision of a delegate of the second respondent under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and s 475A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
The applicant challenges a decision of the second respondent in the Australian High Commission in Malaysia made on or before 12 November 2003 refusing to re-evidence a Return Endorsement or Transitional (Permanent) visa into her newly issued Malaysian passport.
2 On 28 June 2006 the applicant filed an amended application pursuant to leave granted on 31 May 2006.
The applicant claims:
 
 
 '1.
An order in the nature of a writ of mandamus and/or an injunction requiring the Second Respondent to give, pursuant to section 70 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), the Applicant evidence of her Transitional (Permanent) Visa.

 
 2.
Alternatively, an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus and/or an injunction requiring the First Respondent to give, pursuant to reg 2.18 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth), the Applicant evidence of her Transitional (Permanent) Visa.

 
 3.
An order that the First Respondent pay the Applicant's costs of the application.

 
 4.
Such further or other orders as this Honourable Court deems fit.
' 
 
 

3 The amended application provides two grounds in support of the application.
They are:
 
 
 '1.
The applicant is the holder of a Transitional (Permanent) Visa and the Second Respondent has refused to give, pursuant to section 70 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), the Applicant evidence of her visa.

 
 2.
The respondents are estopped, or otherwise prohibited by operation of law, from denying that the Applicant is the holder of a Transitional (Permanent) Visa.

 
 

4 The applicant is a Malaysian citizen.
She is a solicitor.
She has lived in Australia for long periods of time both as a child and an adult.
This proceeding is brought to determine whether she is entitled to evidence of her holding a Transitional (Permanent) visa.
5 A non-citizen who immediately before 1 September 2004 held an old visa of the kind known as '(a) an Authority to Return or (b) a Return Endorsement' is taken, on 1 September 2004 to have been granted a Transitional (Permanent) visa: reg 9 Migration Reform (Transitional) Regulations (Cth) 1994 (the Transitional Regulations).
The regulation provides that a Transitional (Permanent) visa permits the visa holder to enter Australia within three years after each departure from Australia and remain indefinitely in Australia.
She would be entitled to evidence of a Transitional (Permanent) visa if immediately before 1 September 1994 she held an Authority to Return or a Return Endorsement.
6 Before dealing with the facts, it is necessary to identify the relevant legislation relating to evidence of visas and the relevant legislation relating to a Transitional (Permanent) visa.
The relevant legislation on evidencing a visa 
 
7 The applicant contends that the respondent failed when requested by the applicant in 2003 to evidence a visa as required by s 70 of the Migration Act , which provides:
 
 ' 70 Evidence of visa 
 
 Subject to the regulations, if a non-citizen is granted a visa, an officer is to give the non-citizen evidence of the visa.
' 
 

8 Division 2.4 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (the Migration Regulations ) governs the evidencing of visas.
Relevantly, reg 2.18 provides:
 
 ' 2.18 Re-evidencing of resident return visas 
 
 (1) If: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) evidence of a resident return visa has been given in a passport; and 
 
 (b) either: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) the evidence, or the passport, has been damaged, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed, or otherwise cannot, for good reason, be presented for travel purposes; or 
 
 (ii) the passport has expired, or has been cancelled, or is no longer applicable to that person; 
 
 
 
 the person to whom the visa was granted may apply to the Minister for evidence of the visa to be given to the person in a passport of that person.

 
 
 
 (2) ... 
 
 (2A) ... 
 
 (3) If the application is not an Internet application, and the applicant is not in Australia at the time of making the application: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the application must be in accordance with approved form 1085; and 
 
 (b) the fee payable on application is $70.

 
 
 
 
 (4) In this regulation, resident return visa means: 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) a transitional (permanent) visa that is taken to have been granted under regulation 9 of the Migration Reform (Transitional Provisions) Regulations ; ...' 
 
 
 
 The relevant legislation 
 
9 In 1976 s 6 of the Migration Act authorised an officer of the Department ... to grant an immigrant an 'entry permit ...'.
The applicant was granted an Authority to Return on 18 November 1976.
The grant of an Authority to Return was by administrative action in placing a stamp in an eligible person's passport.
10 The Migration Act was amended in 1979 by the Migration Amendment Act 1979 (the Amending Act), which came into force on 1 November 1979.
The Amending Act inserted ss 11A and 11B into the Migration Act .
Section 11A relevantly provided:
 
 '11A (1) An authorized officer may, in accordance with this section --- 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 
 
 
 
 (b) upon request by a person who is residing in Australia, or has resided in Australia and wishes to return to Australia, grant to that person a return endorsement with respect to travel to Australia by that person ... on any number of occasions while it remains in force.

 
 
 
 
 (2) A visa or return endorsement-- 
 
 (a) ... 
 
 (b) ... 
 
 (c) shall be expressed to continue in force until the expiration of a date specified in it, or of a period specified or otherwise described in it; and 
 
 (d) shall, notwithstanding that it is so expressed to continue in force cease to be in force upon cancellation under section 11B.
' 
 
 
 
 

11 A 'return endorsement' was defined to mean a Return Endorsement in force under s 11A: s 3 of the Amending Act and s 5 of the Migration Act .
12 Section 9(3) of the Amending Act provided:
 
 
 '(3) A document or notation issued before the date fixed under sub-section 2(2) in respect of the return of a person to Australia, being a document or notation that had not expired or been cancelled before that date, has effect, on and after that date, according to its tenor, for all the purposes of the Principal Act as amended by the Act, as if it were a return endorsement duly granted under section 11A of the Principal Act as so amended.
' 
 
 

13 Section 11B provided:
 
 
 '11B The Minister or an authorized officer may, in his absolute discretion, cancel a visa or return endorsement at any time by writing under his hand.
' 
 
 

14 It follows that as at 1 November 1979 the holder of an Authority to Return was deemed to be the holder of a Return Endorsement issued pursuant to s 11A of the Migration Act by the operation of s 9(3) of the Amending Act.
15 Authority to Return stamps were withdrawn from use in Australia on 2 July 1979 and were replaced by Return Endorsement stamps.
16 The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1987 (the Miscellaneous Provisions Act) came into effect on 1 January 1988.
Section 3 of the Miscellaneous Provisions Act had the effect of amending all the acts in Schedule 1 of the Miscellaneous Provisions Act.
Section 11A of the Migration Act was amended to delete all reference to 'a return endorsement'.
17 Section 5(14) of the Miscellaneous Provisions Act provided:
 
 'Notwithstanding the amendments of the Migration Act 1958 made by this Act, the first-mentioned Act, as in force immediately before the commencement of this section, continues to apply in relation to return endorsements issued under the first-mentioned Act before the commencement of this section.
' 
 

18 The effect of that transitional provision was to preserve any Return Endorsement already issued.
19 The respondent tendered an affidavit of Christine Sawa who has been an officer of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) since 1979, who gave evidence of the history relating to Authorities to Return and Return Endorsements.
She deposed:
 
 
 '5.
From January 1987, ATRs and REs were replaced by a system of Resident Return Visas ("RRV").
During a 3-year "transitional period" between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 1989, holders of existing ATRs and REs were encouraged to apply for RRV.
In many cases the evidence of the ATR or RE in the holder's passport would be stamped as "cancelled" when a replacement RRV was issued.
' 
 
 

20 That evidence is consistent with the legislative history.
21 Section 11A of the Migration Act was repealed by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 (Cth) which came into effect on 19 December 1989.
Section 5(14) , however, of the Miscellaneous Provisions Act has not been repealed.
22 On 1 September 1994 reg 9 of the Migration Reform (Transitional) Regulations came into effect.
It provided:
 
 '9.
A non-citizen who, immediately before 1 September 1994, held an old visa of the kind known as: 
 
 
 (a) an Authority to Return; or 
 (b) a Return Endorsement; 
 
 
 is taken, on 1 September 1994, to have been granted a Transitional (Permanent) Visa permitting the holder: 
 
 
 
 (c) to travel to and enter Australia within 3 years after each departure from Australia; and 
 (d) to remain indefinitely in Australia.
' 
 
 
 

23 The effect of that regulation is to deem a holder of an Authority to Return or a Return Endorsement as at 1 September 1994 to be the holder of a Transitional (Permanent) visa with the rights attaching to that visa in pars (c) and (d) of reg 9.
Factual history of the applicant's immigration status 
 
24 The applicant tendered an affidavit in which she deposed to the endorsements and visas which had been granted her over a long period of time.
That evidence was not challenged.
The respondents tendered an affidavit of their solicitor, Mr Kennedy, who exhibited the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) computerised records of visas granted to the applicant.
That evidence was also not challenged.
25 The applicant, Ms Sidhu, was born in Malaysia on 2 February 1967.
On 30 May 1975 she was issued a Malaysian passport which was valid until 30 May 1980 (the 1975 passport).
On 29 July 1975 she was granted an Australian Migrant visa and emigrated to Australia with her parents on the same day.
On 18 November 1976 the applicant was granted an Authority to Return to travel to Australia.
It was evidenced by a stamp placed on page 10 of her 1975 passport.
The stamp reads:
 'COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 
 RESIDENT OF AUSTRALIA 
 AUTHORITY TO RETURN 
 No.
005Z02.629 
 Valid for travel to Australia 
 within three years from date 
 of last departure.
' 
 

26 The 1975 passport was due to expire on 30 May 1980.
On 7 April 1980 the passport was extended until 30 May 1985.
27 On 10 December 1984 the applicant was granted a new Malaysian passport (the 1984 passport) to replace the 1975 passport.
On 10 January 1985 the applicant was provided with a Return Endorsement in the 1984 passport.
It appears on page 11 of the 1984 passport.
It reads:
 'AUSTRALIA No.
[Illegible] 
 RETURN ENDORSEMENT 
 Valid for return travel to Australia by 
 the holder within three years from 
 the date of last departure from Australia 
 ENTRY to Australia is subject to the 
 grant of an Entry Permit on arrival' 
 

28 From July 1975 the applicant resided with her family in Australia.
She attended school and then university, completing her degrees in 1989.
29 Between 1984 and 1989 the applicant departed Australia on many occasions and was granted re-entry upon her return.
30 On 8 July 1989 the applicant departed Australia.
She returned to Sydney through Kingsford Smith Airport on 31 July 1989.
When she gave her 1984 passport to the immigration officer at the airport it was taken for processing and returned to her.
The applicant's evidence was that she did not notice at this time the Return Endorsement on page 11 of the 1984 passport was stamped 'CANCELLED'.
She said that she also did not notice that a new document had been pasted into page 18 of the 1984 passport.
That document read:
 
 'AUSTRALIAN VISA SYDNEY CBD RESIDENT RETURN

SIDHUSHARON R 
 ------------------------------------------

 31 JUL 94 FOR STAY INDEFINITE SUBJECT TO 
 GRANT OF ENTRY PERMIT ON ARRIVAL' 
 

31 The document at page 18 was a Return Resident visa which was valid for a period of five years to 31 July 1994.
32 The applicant deposed that the immigration officer did not explain why the Return Endorsement had been cancelled nor did he seek her approval or consent before stamping the Return Endorsement as cancelled.
33 The applicant deposed that she did not become aware that the Return Endorsement was purportedly cancelled on 31 July 1989 until mid to late 1997.
I will address her evidence in that regard later in these reasons.
34 It was the applicant's evidence that as at 31 July 1989 she did not understand that the Return Endorsement had been purportedly cancelled.
She understood the visa on page 18 of the 1984 passport meant 'that as long as I entered Australia on or before 31 July 1994, the document would be automatically renewed or replaced if I sought to enter Australia subsequently'.
The applicant assumed 'that there was no longer any 3 year requirement from the date of the last departure'.
35 The applicant travelled to London in 1990 to attend university.
She entered and left Australia on a number of occasions between 1990 and 1991.
36 On 20 May 1993 the visa granted on 31 July 1989 was cancelled.
The applicant is now unable to recall the circumstances in which it was cancelled.
Page 35 of the 1984 passport exhibits a new visa which was issued on 21 May 1993.
It provides:
 
 'AUSTRALIAN ENTRY VISA CLASS 155 RESIDENT RETURN

' 
 

37 This was also a Return Resident visa (Class 155) which was valid until 20 May 1998.
Importantly, that Return Resident visa was granted in Kuala Lumpur where the applicant was then residing.
38 There are three classes of Return Resident visas; Subclass 155 a five year Resident Return; Subclass 157 a three month Resident Return; and Subclass 159 a Provisional Resident Return visa.
39 On 8 November 1994 the applicant sought and was granted a new Malaysian passport (the 1994 passport).
On her return to Australia on 16 October 1996 she presented both her 1984 passport (containing evidence of permission to enter Australia) and her 1994 passport.
She presented both passports again on her departure from Australia on 26 October 1996.
40 On 9 September 1997 the applicant applied to the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur for evidence that she was the holder of a Return Endorsement and that it be placed in her 1994 passport.
She completed an application form entitled 'Application for a resident return visa (RRV) or replacement evidence of a RRV --- 1085'.
She also submitted her 1984 and 1994 passports to the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.
41 She said in support of her application:
 
 'Upon my arrival at Kingsford Smith Airport, Sydney on 31/07/89 my Return Endorsement No.
37983967E was cancelled by the Immigration Officer on the spot and without my consent and the cancellation was not explained to me at all.
The Return Endorsement was replaced on the spot by visa No.
E144983 (please see attached page for a copy of the same).
I now seek reinstatement of the Return Endorsement which was not duly cancelled nor properly cancelled.
I shall be greatly obliged if your goodselves would kindly reinstate my Return Endorsement.
' 
 

42 In the same application, she stated that the Return Endorsement expired within three years of the date of the last departure.
43 On 12 September 1997 a senior migration officer in the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, Ms Pereira, sent a facsimile message to the Entry Operations Section (EOS) of the then Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Canberra giving details of manually re-evidenced Authority to Return for inclusion on the visa database.
The reason given for the issue was to reinstate the Authority to Return.
44 The Australian High Commission returned the 1994 passport to the applicant.
It included a document labelled 'Australia Visa' which appeared on page 23 of the 1994 passport.
At the top of the page there is handwriting which reads 'Re-evidenced in New Passport No A9778262'.
The endorsement in the 1994 passport reads:
 
 'AUSTRALIA VISA CLASS BF RESIDENT RETURN

45 The BF111 Label entered in the applicant's 1994 passport was evidence of a Transitional (Permanent) visa granted pursuant to reg 9 of the Transitional provisions which had come into force on 1 September 1994.
The code 'BF' indicates that the class of visa is a Transitional (Permanent) visa: reg 1.06(b)(i) of the Migration Regulations .
46 Subclass 111 is a 'dummy' subclass which was created by the Department to evidence/re-evidence visas granted pursuant to reg 9 of the Transitional Regulations derived from an Authority to Return or Return Endorsement held on 1 September 1994.
47 The BF155 visa (the Return Resident visa) on page 35 of the 1984 passport, which had been granted on 20 May 1993, had been stamped 'LABEL INOPERATIVE'.
48 The applicant sought and was granted a further new Malaysian passport on 10 June 1999 (the 1999 passport).
The applicant again sought to have her right of entry into Australia evidenced in her new passport.
On 14 September 1999 evidence was placed in the applicant's 1999 passport.
The document reads:

' 
 

49 This is the same visa as had been evidenced in the 1994 passport.
50 The applicant travelled to Australia in September 1999 and June 2002 under her 1999 passport using this endorsement as her permission to enter Australia.
51 Her Malaysian passport was due to expire in June 2004.
She sought and obtained a new passport in September 2003 (the 2003 passport).
52 On 25 September 2003 the applicant lodged a further Form 1085 application to have her right of entry to Australia evidenced in her 2003 passport and, on 26 September 2003, a delegate of the Minister placed a further BF111 Label in her passport.
Apparently, the delegate had only checked the computerised movement records from 1996 onwards.
53 Later, on 26 September 2003, EOS telephoned the delegate and advised that the applicant was not entitled to a BF111 visa because she had been absent from Australia for more than three years between April 1991 and October 1996.
54 When the applicant went to collect her passport on 7 November 2003 the visa in the 1999 passport had been stamped 'LABEL INOPERATIVE'.
The 2003 passport included a document entitled 'Australian Visa' which was also stamped 'LABEL INOPERATIVE'.
55 On 12 November 2003 an officer of the Australian High Commission in Malaysia wrote to the applicant advising of her correct immigration status.
The officer wrote:
 
 'On 25 September 2003 you applied to have your Authority to Return [ATR] reevidenced into your new passport.
Departmental records indicate that you were absent from Australia for more than three years between 1991 and 1996.
