 THE PLEADINGS 
 Applicants' claim 
 
1 The first applicant (Harold) is the father of the second applicant (Saul) and the second respondent (Lionel).
The third respondent (Joel) is not related to them.
Since 11 November 2002 Lionel and Joel have been directors of the first respondent (JLCS).
JLCS does not significantly feature in the case, and where I refer to Harold, Saul, Lionel and Joel as a group, I will call them 'the parties'.
2 Harold and Saul claim that on or about 19 June 1997 they entered into an agreement with Lionel and Joel concerning the establishment of steak restaurants under the 'Squires Loft' trading name (the agreement).
There were said to be the following terms of the agreement:
 
 (a) the parties would be equal partners in any venture of establishing further steak restaurants under the Squires Loft name through licence or franchise arrangements;
 (b) Harold and Saul would open the first licensed Squires Loft restaurant in the City of Melbourne (the City restaurant) which would be the flagship restaurant and would provide a centralised kitchen for preparing sauces for the City restaurant, Lionel and Joel's Squires Loft restaurant in South Yarra (the South Yarra restaurant) and any future licensed or franchised restaurants;
 (c) all licensed or franchised restaurants trading under the name Squires Loft would adopt common menus and products, pricing of products, stationery, serviettes and corporate livery;
 (d) all restaurants trading under the name Squires Loft would jointly promote and market other such restaurants through advertising, references on menus, business cards and stationery;
 (e) the purchasing of products for use in the licensed restaurants would be undertaken centrally to enable greater purchasing power, although each would pay for its own products used;
 (f) the parties would jointly own all intellectual property related to the venture, including the name Squires Loft, and
 (g) no party would make use of that intellectual property without the consent of the others.


3 The agreement is said to have been made in discussions between the parties on or about 19 June 1997, at which time they agreed on the terms in [2](a) to (f).
In the alternative it is alleged that term (f) is to be implied as a matter of business efficacy.
Term (g) is said to be so implied.
4 It is then alleged that the following things were done in accordance with the terms of the agreement:
 
 (a) in or about June 1997 Harold and the manager of the South Yarra restaurant designed a logo incorporating the name Squires Loft (the logo), the cost of creating the artwork for which was paid for by the parties;
 (b) on 14 October 1997 Harold and Saul, through their company Squires Loft City Steakhouse Pty Ltd (SLCS), opened the City restaurant in Goldie Place, Melbourne;
 (c) on 2 November 1998 four companies controlled respectively by Harold and Lionel, Lionel and Joel, Stan Friedman and Rohan Day, entered into a joint venture arrangement pursuant to which they opened a steakhouse in St Kilda which traded under the name Squires Loft (the St Kilda restaurant);
 (d) between 14 October 1997 and 16 March 2005 SLCS made the kitchen of the City restaurant available to support and supply products to the South Yarra restaurant, and, for the period during which it operated, to the St Kilda restaurant;
 (e) in late 1999/early 2000 the parties paid out the other two investors in the St Kilda restaurant;
 (f) the parties jointly provided operational support and assistance, training of staff, product development and the supply of sauces and condiments to the St Kilda restaurant until its closure in May/June 2001;
 (g) in May 2001 Harold and Saul paid half the costs of Garry Williamson of the Franchise Centre, who advised the parties in relation to franchising the Squires Loft business;
 (h) from May to September 2001 the parties shared the costs of employing a graphic artist to develop a new look and image for the menus and logos used on business cards and stationery, menus, table napkins, advertising and corporate clothing for the City and South Yarra restaurants;
 (i) the logo was used on all business cards and stationery, menus, table napkins, websites, advertising and corporate clothing for the City, St Kilda and South Yarra restaurants, and
 (j) Saul, with the knowledge of the other parties, registered a trade mark for Squires Loft, with effect from 28 June 2002.


5 Harold and Saul allege that in breach of the agreement Lionel, Joel and JLCS have asserted that they are the owners of the trade mark and all intellectual property rights in relation to the Squires Loft restaurants, that JLCS has licensed the mark without their consent, and that it, Lionel and Joel have threatened to grant further licences to third parties to use the mark without Harold and Saul's consent.
Particulars of these breaches assert that JLCS has granted a six month licence to The Grill Room Pty Ltd to use the trade mark and/or the logo in respect of its St Kilda restaurant and an option to open four further restaurants, and that from at least 9 March 2005 the mark has been used in connection with The Grill Room's business.
