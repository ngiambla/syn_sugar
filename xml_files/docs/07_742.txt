 
1 This is an appeal from a Federal Magistrate.
His Honour dismissed a claim that the respondent had contravened s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ").
On 13 September 2005 the Acting Chief Justice ordered, pursuant to s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), that the appeal should be heard and determined by a single Judge.
THE FACTS 
 
2 The appellant is a research scientist.
He was employed by the respondent between 15 May 2000 and 31 December 2002.
He was employed initially to undertake a research project in the respondent's Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology.
Subsequently the appellant commenced work on another project within the Department.
3 The department forms part of the University's Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences.
In April 2002 the appellant had a conversation with Professor Angus, the then Deputy Dean of the Faculty and Head of the Department of Pharmacology.
The appellant wished to pursue a further research project relating to diabetes.
It involved the study of the effect of diabetes on blood vessels.
The appellant spoke to Professor Angus because Professor Angus's approval was needed for the project to proceed.
Although the appellant had secured the agreement of a pharmaceutical corporation --- The Pharmacia Corporation - to fund the research, the appellant needed laboratory space within the university and access to some expensive equipment and to human muscle tissue from the legs of diabetes patients.
The appellant alleged that, at a meeting on 18 April 2002 and at various other times between then and December 2002, Professor Angus represented to him that the respondent had the necessary equipment to perform the proposed experiments ("the equipment representations") and that, subject to certain amendments to a proposed agreement between the appellant, the respondent and the pharmaceutical corporation, the respondent would proceed with the project and provide the equipment and human tissue necessary for its conduct ("the project representations").
Professor Angus denied making such representations.
The learned Magistrate found that the alleged representations had not been made.
THE MAGISTRATE'S FINDINGS 
 
4 The Federal Magistrate accepted Professor Angus's evidence that the equipment which the appellant wished to use for his project was being used by another researcher Dr Lew.
Its availability depended on Dr Lew's willingness to provide it for use by the appellant.
His Honour noted (at [67]):
 
 "Professor Angus knew at the time of the discussion with [the appellant] on 18 April 2002 that if the equipment was going to be used, normal protocols or practice meant that Dr Lew's permission would be needed.
It is highly likely that Professor Angus did say to [the appellant] that there was equipment available but that Dr Lew's permission would be needed.
Professor Angus would not have promised to make the equipment available because he could not give that promise.
He could only discuss it as a potential source of equipment and I find that that is what he did.
Professor Angus did not make a promise about the equipment.
" 

5 In dealing the with the claim that Professor Angus had represented that human tissue would be available, the Federal Magistrate noted an answer given by the appellant in cross-examination in the following exchange:
 
 "So you say that he actually promised to you in this first meeting that if at sometime in the future that this contract went ahead, he would get the tissue?
--- Yes, he said that he had colleagues he could approach and source the tissue from them.
" 

The Magistrate continued:
 
 "[69] The answer that Professor Angus said that he had colleagues he could approach who could supply the tissue is close to [the appellant's] version.
In fact, it is a correct statement if it is qualified by saying that the tissue could be supplied if the colleagues were prepared to provide the tissue, the patients consented and ethics approval was obtained.
It is not the same as a promise to supply the tissue.
It suggests that [the appellant's] statement that Professor Angus promised to supply tissue is [the appellant's] interpretation of what occurred, not his recollection of the actual statement.

 
 [70] It is most unlikely that Professor Angus would have promised that the tissue could be supplied.
It was not for him to make the decision about supplying the tissue.
This could only be done with the permission of patients and the cooperation of the surgeons conducting operations.
Professor Angus was well aware of this.

 
 [71] [The appellant] said that the number of human tissue samples that would be needed was contained within the research proposal.
[The appellant's] evidence was that he showed the research proposal to Professor Angus at the meeting on 18 April 2002, but did not leave it with him.
It is most unlikely, even assuming that Professor Angus had noted the number of tissue samples needed from looking at the proposal, that Professor Angus would have said there and then that he could arrange for their supply.

 
 [72] The probabilities are that Professor Angus was, as he said, enthusiastic about the proposal, and that a possible source of equipment and possible sources of tissue samples were discussed, but no promise was made.
Professor Angus was not in a position to make any promises.
The proposal was at an early stage.
The terms of agreement with Pharmacia had to be negotiated.
Professor Angus was not given the opportunity to study the proposal.
It is improbable that any promise was made.

 
 [73] Notwithstanding that Professor Angus said he could not remember precisely what was said, the evidence leads to a conclusion that promises, or in terms of s 51A of the Trade Practices Act , representations as to future matters were not made by Professor Angus.
" 

6 Other representations were also relied on by the appellant before the Federal Magistrate.
However, no challenge to his findings relating to those other representations are made on this appeal.
THE APPEAL GROUNDS 
 
7 At the hearing the appellant abandoned most of the grounds upon which he relied in his notice of appeal.
The principal ground relied on was cast in negative terms.
It was that the Federal Magistrate had erred in failing to find that the equipment representations and the project representations had been made by the respondent.
It was contended that these failures were against the evidence and the weight of the evidence and were not reasonably open on the evidence.
The other two grounds which were pressed alleged error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in his application of ss 51A , 52 and 53B of the Act .
Each of these grounds can only succeed, as counsel for the appellant properly conceded, if the Magistrate erred in finding that the representations had not been made.
8 The respondent has filed a notice of contention.
The respondent contends that the Federal Magistrate did not deal with the question of whether the appellant relied on any of the alleged representations and submitted that, had he done so, he should have upheld the respondent's defence on the additional ground that there was no evidence of any reliance on such reprsentations by the appellant to his detriment.
The respondent further contends that there was no evidence to support the Magistrate's finding that, had the representations been made, the appellant would have suffered loss, calculated by reference to what he would have earned had he commenced employment with an alternative employer on 1 January 2003 rather than 15 April 2003.
THE APPELLANT'S CASE 
 The equipment representations 
 
9 The appellant complains that the Federal Magistrate based his conclusion that the equipment representations had not been made exclusively on his findings about what had transpired at the meeting between the appellant and Professor Angus on 18 April 2002.
It was submitted that the Magistrate had ignored documentary evidence which he says supports the claim that the representations had been made at other times as well in the period between May and December 2002.
