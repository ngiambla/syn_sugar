 
 HIS HONOUR 
 
1 Mr Caldar, the applicant, appears in person.
He says that he presses both his original application to the Court filed on 30 January 2007 and his amended application filed on 3 April 2007.
2 The order sought in the initial application was that an intended "Special Leave to Appeal Application be removed into the High Court list.
" This was a reference to an intended application dated 9 September 2005 for special leave to appeal to the High Court from three judgments of individual judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court; a judgment of Giles JA of 29 August 2005, a judgment of Campbell J of 8 July 2005 and a judgment of White J of 22 April 2005.
3 The grounds of the application were said to be "Unconscionable Conduct, and Perverting the Course of Justice as referenced in the Applicant's Statutory Declaration ...
attached.
" The statutory declaration is 246 paragraphs long and encloses various documents.
4 It seems that the background to what has been a great amount of litigation is that Mr Caldar's mother, the late Mrs Rachel Gittoes, had two sons, Mr Caldar and Allan Ramon Gittoes.
Mrs Gittoes died on 27 April 2001.
She left a will dated 21 July 1967 which, in the events that had happened, relevantly directed her trustee to sell and convert into money all her real and personal property, and to divide the same and to hold any unconverted property in trust for her two sons as tenants in common in equal shares.
5 On 23 January 1995 it appears that the late Mrs Gittoes signed a letter which said:
 
 To Whom It May Concern
 
 My letter is to confirm I consent to my son, Russell Graham Gittoes [who as indicated is Mr Caldar] living in my house and upon my death I want him to stay living in my house and to keep my house for himself as long as he wishes.
I have made this decision because Russell has taken care of me in my house, at some trouble and expense to himself, and in return I feel I should do this for him to help him in later life.
I declare I have made this decision of my own free will, and have not been influenced by any person.
Yours faithfully.



 
6 Apparently for many years Mr Caldar looked after his mother.
7 The Public Trustee of New South Wales, the respondent to the intended application for special leave to appeal, was granted letters of administration of the estate of Mrs Gittoes with the will annexed on 20 May 2002, the surviving appointed executor named in the will having renounced his position.
The Public Trustee proceeded to carry out the wishes of the testator as they were expressed in the will made nearly 30 years before the letter.
This involved, among other things, selling the house in which, as at the date of Mrs Gittoes' death, Mr Caldar was living; his mother was by that time residing in a nursing home.
The funds obtained by conversion of Mrs Gittoes' property into money were duly divided.
The Public Trustee still holds a considerable amount of money in trust for Mr Caldar and has sought to pay it to him but he declines to have it.
8 There has been a deal of litigation in which, in substance, Mr Caldar has sought to have effect given to his mother's wishes as expressed in the letter.
He has formed the view that the Public Trustee has behaved wrongly, indeed with grave impropriety, and that there is much amiss in this regard in the state of public administration in New South Wales.
He has had no success in the Supreme Court.
9 The amended application in this Court seeks orders that the Public Trustee, whom Mr Caldar had joined as a second respondent in his original application to this Court, should be removed as a party and that he should have "default judgment" on his claim that "his Special Leave to Appeal Application be removed into the High Court list.
" He asks, "alternatively," although really as preliminary matters, that I should disqualify myself from further hearing his case in this Court and that the case be referred to a Full Court.
I declined these preliminary applications.
10 Ms Carlsund, the first respondent, was at all material times the Deputy Registrar of the New South Wales Registry of the High Court of Australia.
She indicated her intention to abide by any order of this Court save as to costs.
11 There had been previous efforts by Mr Caldar to have his grievances ventilated in the High Court.
He filed an application for special leave to appeal in matter S436/2003 in which he sought special leave to appeal against a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal but ultimately, on 1 April 2004, discontinued that application.
Two days before such discontinuance he filed another application for special leave to appeal (S109/2004) against a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal and named the Public Trustee of New South Wales as the respondent.
He failed to file application books as directed and the application for special leave to appeal was deemed to be abandoned pursuant to the High Court Rules.
12 On 1 February 2005 Mr Caldar filed a summons seeking reinstatement of that application for special leave to appeal.
However, on 16 March 2005 Gummow J dismissed that summons.
13 There apparently followed extensive correspondence between Mr Caldar and officers of the Court in relation to Mr Caldar's wish to file another application for special leave to appeal.
