 The nature of the proceeding 
 
 1 This proceeding is concerned with allegations of the fixing of retail prices of petrol in the Geelong retail petrol market.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the ACCC') alleged that a series of arrangements or understandings existed, between competitors in that market, each containing a provision having the purpose, or having or being likely to have the effect, of fixing those prices.
Further, the ACCC alleged that, on a number of occasions in 1999 and 2000, the parties to all or some of those arrangements or understandings gave effect to their arrangements or understandings, by fixing the retail price of unleaded petrol ('ULP').
This conduct was alleged to have contravened s 45(2)(a) and (b) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Trade Practices Act ').
2 The relief sought is primarily the imposition of pecuniary penalties (of a civil, not a criminal, kind), but also includes declaratory and injunctive relief.
3 Some respondents have admitted the substance of the allegations against them.
Some of the natural person respondents, associated with the corporate respondents, gave evidence on behalf of the ACCC at the trial of the proceeding.
In addition to that direct evidence, the ACCC relied on circumstantial evidence, principally a document compiled from data available to the ACCC of records of telephone communications between participants in the Geelong retail petrol market, and records of changes to the retail price of ULP by various participants in that market.
The ACCC also sought to rely on the formal admissions made by some respondents, and on other admissions.
In some instances, it sought to use admissions by one party against another party, on the basis that the two parties concerned were engaged in the furtherance of a common purpose, and that the statements of one were admissible against the other.
4 These reasons for judgment deal extensively with the factual issues arising from the evidence.
They also deal with some legal issues, principally those concerned with the elements necessary for the existence of an arrangement or understanding for the purposes of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act .
They are necessarily long, because the trial occupied 31 days, and the quantity of documentary evidence tendered was substantial and required extensive analysis.

 The legislation 
 Section 45 of the Trade Practices Act and associated provisions 
 
 5 Section 45 of the Trade Practices Act provides, so far as is relevant:
 '(2) A corporation shall not: 
 
 (a) make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an 
 understanding, if: 
 
 ... 
 
 (ii) a provision of the proposed contract, arrangement or 
 understanding has the purpose, or would have or be 
 likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening 
 competition; or 
 
 (b) give effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or 
 understanding, whether the contract or arrangement was 
 made, or the understanding was arrived at, before or after the 
 commencement of this section, if that provision: 
 
 ... 
 
 (ii) has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, 
 of substantially lessening competition.

 
 (3) For the purposes of this section and section 45A , competition , in 
 relation to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding 
 or of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, means 
 competition in any market in which a corporation that is a party to 
 the contract, arrangement or understanding or would be a party to 
 the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, or any body 
 corporate related to such a corporation, supplies or acquires, or is 
 likely to supply or acquire, goods or services or would, but for the 
 provision, supply or acquire, or be likely to supply or acquire, goods 
 or services.

 
 (4) For the purposes of the application of this section in relation to a 
 particular corporation, a provision of a contract, arrangement or 
 understanding or of a proposed contract, arrangement or 
 understanding shall be deemed to have or to be likely to have the 
 effect of substantially lessening competition if that provision and any 
 one or more of the following provisions, namely: 
 
 (a) the other provisions of that contract, arrangement or 
 understanding or proposed contract, arrangement or 
 understanding; and 
 
 (b) the provisions of any other contract, arrangement or 
 understanding or proposed contract, arrangement or 
 understanding to which the corporation or a body corporate 
 related to the corporation is or would be a party; 
 
 together have or are likely to have that effect.
' 
 
 6 Section 45A of the Trade Practices Act provides relevantly:
 '(1) Without limiting the generality of section 45 , a provision of a contract, 
 arrangement or understanding, or of a proposed contract, 
 arrangement or understanding, shall be deemed for the purposes of 
 that section to have the purpose, or to have or to be likely to have the 
 effect, of substantially lessening competition if the provision has the 
 purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, as the case may be, of 
 fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, 
 controlling or maintaining of, the price for, or a discount, allowance, 
 rebate or credit in relation to, goods or services supplied or acquired 
 or to be supplied or acquired by the parties to the contract, 
 arrangement or understanding or the proposed parties to the 
 proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, or by any of them, 
 or by any bodies corporate that are related to any of them, in 
 competition with each other.

 
 ... 
 
 (5) For the purposes of this Act, a provision of a contract, arrangement 
 or understanding, or of a proposed contract, arrangement or 
 understanding, shall not be taken not to have the purpose, or not to 
 have or to be likely to have the effect, of fixing, controlling or 
 maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining 
 of, the price for, or a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation 
 to, goods or services by reason only of: 
 
 (a) the form of, or of that provision of, the contract, arrangement 
 or understanding or the proposed contract, arrangement or 
 understanding; or 
 
 (b) any description given to, or to that provision of, the contract, 
 arrangement or understanding or the proposed contract, 
 arrangement or understanding by the parties or proposed 
 parties.

 
 (6) For the purposes of this Act but without limiting the generality of 
 subsection (5), a provision of a contract, arrangement or 
 understanding, or of a proposed contract, arrangement or 
 understanding, shall not be taken not to have the purpose, or not to 
 have or to be likely to have the effect, of fixing, controlling or 
 maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining 
 of, the price for, or a discount, allowance, rebate or credit in relation 
 to, goods or services by reason only that the provision recommends, 
 or provides for the recommending of, such a price, discount, 
 allowance, rebate or credit if in fact the provision has that purpose 
 or has or is likely to have that effect.

' 
 
 13 Section 155 of the Trade Practices Act provides, so far as is relevant: 
 
 
 '(1) Subject to subsection (2A), if the Commission, the Chairperson or the Deputy Chairperson has reason to believe that a person is capable of furnishing information, producing documents or giving evidence relating to a matter that constitutes, or may constitute, a contravention of this Act...a member of the Commission may, by notice in writing served on that person, require that person:

' 
 
 
 
 14 Section 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides:
 'The Court may, in relation to a matter in which it has original jurisdiction, make binding declarations of right, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.
' 
 
 Provisions relating to admissions 
 
 15 Section 59(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ('the Evidence Act ') provides:
 'Evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation.
' 
 
 16 According to the definition of 'hearsay rule', found in the dictionary of the Evidence Act , the hearsay rule is s 59(1).
Section 60 of the Evidence Act provides:
 'The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation.
' 
 
 17 By s 81(1) of the Evidence Act , the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of an admission.
According to the Evidence Act 's dictionary, an admission means a previous representation that is made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding and is adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding.
Section 83 provides: 
 
 
 '(1) Section 81 does not prevent the application of the hearsay rule...to evidence of an admission in respect of the case of a third party.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The evidence may be used in respect of the case of a third party if that party consents.

 
 
 
 (3) Consent cannot be given in respect of part only of the evidence.

 
 (4) In this section: 
 
 
 
 third party means a party to the proceeding concerned, other than the party who: 
 
 
 
 (a) made the admission; or 
 
 (b) adduced the evidence.
' 
 
 18 Section 87 of the Evidence Act provides: 
 
 
 '(1) For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by a person is also taken to be an admission by a party, the court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) when the representation was made, the person had authority to make statements on behalf of the party in relation to the matter with respect to which the representation was made; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) when the representation was made, the person was an employee of the party, or had authority otherwise to act for the party, and the representation related to a matter within the scope of the person's employment or authority; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the representation was made by the person in furtherance of a common purpose (whether lawful or not) that the person had with the party or one or more persons including the party.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) For the purposes of this section, the hearsay rule does not apply to a previous representation made by a person that tends to prove: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) that the person had authority to make statements on behalf of another person in relation to a matter; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) that the person was an employee of another person or had authority otherwise to act for another person; or 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the scope of the person's employment or authority.
' 
 
 19 Section 57(2) of the Evidence Act provides, so far as is relevant, that:
 'if the relevance of evidence of an act done by a person depends on the court making a finding that the person and one or more other persons had, or were acting in furtherance of, a common purpose (whether to effect an unlawful conspiracy or otherwise), the court may use the evidence itself in determining whether the common purpose existed.
' 
 
 20 Order 11 r 13(1) of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) ('the Federal Court Rules ') provides as follows:
 'Subject to subrule (3) and to Order 43, rule 7 (which deals with persons under disability), an allegation of fact made by a party in his pleading is deemed to be admitted by the opposite party unless it is traversed by that party in his pleading or a joinder of issue under rule 14 operates as a denial of it.
' 
 
 21 Order 18 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules provides: 
 
 
 '(1) If an admission is made by a party, whether by a pleading or otherwise, the Court may pronounce any judgment or make any order to which the applicant is entitled on the admission.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) The Court may exercise its powers under subrule (1) notwithstanding that other questions in the proceeding have not been determined.
' 
 
 
 
 Provisions relating to the standard of proof 
 
 22 Section 140 of the Evidence Act provides as follows: 
 
 
 '(1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.

 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: 
 
 
 
 (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence; and 
 
 (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding; and 
 
 (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.
' 
 
 The construction of the legislative provisions 
 Arrangements or understandings 
 
 23 The starting point for determining the meaning of statutory provisions must be those provisions themselves.
Previous authorities, in which the courts have pronounced upon the meanings of particular provisions, may be binding, and are often helpful.
Sometimes, however, those pronouncements are made in the context of the resolution of particular issues, which may differ from those raised in a current case.
As Merkel J recognised in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1678 (2004) 141 FCR 183 (' the Ballarat case ') at [57], previous statements of principle can be difficult to apply in a case that raises different issues.
As his Honour said, it is necessary to return to the words of the statute.
24 Section 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act uses the terms 'contract', 'arrangement' and 'understanding'.
These are plainly intended to represent a spectrum of consensual dealings.
The words of the statute themselves so demonstrate.
They provide that a corporation is not to 'make' a contract or arrangement, or to 'arrive at' an understanding, if the contract, arrangement or understanding has a specified content.
A corporation cannot 'make' a contract or arrangement, or 'arrive at' an understanding, without there being at least one other party to the contract, arrangement or understanding.
The other party must also participate in the making, or the arriving at, before there can be a contract, arrangement or understanding.
Clearly, it is not possible to 'make' something, or to 'arrive at' something, unless what is made or arrived at exists at the end of the process of making or arriving at.
What must exist for s 45(2)(a) to apply is one of the three forms of consensual dealing.
25 The term 'contract' is well understood by lawyers.
A contract is the result of the acceptance by one party of an offer made by another, resulting in the minds of the two parties being at one as to the agreement they have made.
It must be supported by good consideration, have sufficient certainty of terms that it be possible to determine what has been agreed, and be accompanied by an intention on the part of the parties that a legally binding relationship should be established by it.
In ordinary circumstances, the obligations created by a contract are enforceable in a court, but their enforceability is subject to the possibility of defences arising from the nature of the contract itself, or from external circumstances.
One defence arising from the nature of the contract itself results from the illegality of its purpose.
In using the word 'contract' in s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act , Parliament must have intended to refer to a consensual dealing having the fundamental characteristics of a contract, but not necessarily being enforceable in a court of law, because s 45(2)(a) would itself give rise to the defence of illegality, and thereby prevent enforcement.
Thus, the word 'contract' for the purposes of s 45(2)(a) describes a consensual dealing with a high degree of formality.
26 The word 'arrangement' is less clearly understood, and more susceptible of elasticity as to its meaning.
In general, it appears to connote a consensual dealing lacking some of the essential elements that would otherwise make it a contract.
For instance, a dealing that would otherwise be a contract may be described as an 'arrangement' if the parties to it intended not to create a legally binding relationship, but only to give expression to their intentions as to the obligations that each felt morally bound to adhere to in relation to what was to pass between them, or to be carried out by them.
Of course, an arrangement might be a broader concept than this, because it is a term the boundaries of which have not been fixed in the traditional understanding of lawyers.
The Oxford English Dictionary gives as the apparently appropriate meaning of the word 'arrangement' 'a settlement of mutual relations or claims between parties; an adjustment of disputed or debatable matters; a settlement by agreement', or alternatively, 'disposition of measures for the accomplishment of a purpose; preparations for successful performance.
' The ordinary understanding of what amounts to an 'arrangement' makes it difficult to envisage that an arrangement could come about without express negotiations between the parties, although there have been suggestions that an arrangement can be tacit.
See Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd (1979) 41 FLR 277 at 301 --- 302 per Fisher J, with whom Brennan and Deane JJ agreed, referred to by Franki J in Trade Practices Commission v TNT Management Pty Ltd (1985) 6 FCR 1 at 24 in the context of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act .
At the very least, there must be some express communication between the parties, although what is said may not amount to offer and acceptance for the purposes of the law of contract.
The need for express communication is also suggested by the use of the verb 'make' in conjunction with both 'contract' and 'arrangement' in s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act .
It is hard to see how two parties could 'make' an 'arrangement' without doing so expressly, at least as to the substance of the arrangement, even if the acceptance by one party of what the other has communicated is implicit in some act, rather than expressed in words.
27 The word 'understanding' is obviously intended to connote a less precise dealing than either a contract or arrangement.
This is so because of the meaning of the word 'understanding' itself, and because, in the terms of s 45(2)(a) , the parties to it may 'arrive at' it instead of making it.
Once again, the Oxford English Dictionary supplies an appropriate definition: 'a mutual arrangement or agreement of an informal but more or less explicit nature.
' It is the informal and less explicit nature of an understanding that led Smithers J to describe the concept of an understanding as 'broad and flexible' in L Grollo  Co Pty Ltd v Nu-Statt Decorating Pty Ltd (1978) 34 FLR 81 at 89.
28 However broad and flexible an understanding might be, for the purposes of s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act it must be a consensual dealing between parties.
Like an arrangement, it falls outside the sphere of contractual obligations of a kind normally enforceable in a court.
Unlike an arrangement, it can be tacit, in the sense that it can be arrived at by each party, either by words or acts, signifying an intention to act in a particular way in relation to a matter of concern to another party.
In order to be a consensual dealing, however, an understanding must involve a meeting of minds.
In Top Performance Motors Pty Ltd v Ira Berk (Queensland) Pty Ltd (1975) 24 FLR 286 at 291, Smithers J (with whom Evatt J agreed) referred to what Diplock LJ said in British Basic Slag Ltd v Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements [1963] 2 All ER 807 at 819 in relation to English legislation in terms different from s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act , and said:
 'by parity of reasoning it would follow that the existence of an arrangement of the kind contemplated in s. 45 is conditional upon a meeting of the minds of the parties to the arrangement in which one of them is understood, by the other or others, and intends to be so understood, as undertaking, in the role of a reasonable and conscientious man, to regard himself as being in some degree under a duty, moral or legal, to conduct himself in some particular way, at any rate so long as the other party or parties conducted themselves in the way contemplated by the arrangement.

 
 It seems to me also that an understanding must involve the meeting of two or more minds.
Where the minds of the parties are at one that a proposed transaction between them proceeds on the basis of the maintenance of a particular state of affairs or the adoption of a particular course of conduct, it would seem that there would be an understanding within the meaning of the Act.
' 
 
 29 Similarly, in Grollo at 89, Smithers J said as to an understanding that:
 'It may arise merely where the minds of the parties are at one that a proposed transaction proceeds on the basis of the maintenance of a particular state of affairs or the adoption of a particular course of conduct'.

 
 30 This view as to what is necessary for the formation of an understanding has been followed on many occasions.
It is unnecessary to set out all of the authorities in which it has been referred to.
I accept the correctness of what Smithers J said without hesitation.
It is important, however, not to confuse what is required for the formation of an understanding within the meaning of s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act with what is required to be the content of an arrangement or understanding for the purposes of s 45(2)(a).
Counsel for the ACCC were inclined to rely on authorities describing the formation of an understanding, when attempting to persuade the Court as to the required content.
31 Section 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act , and the other provisions found in s 45 and s 45A , which are set out above, make a number of things very clear.
To fall within s 45(2)(a) , an arrangement or understanding must be substantial enough to contain at least one 'provision'.
The Oxford English Dictionary relevantly defines 'provision' as meaning:
 'Each of the clauses or divisions of a legal or formal statement, or such a statement itself, providing for some particular matter; also, a clause in such a statement which makes an express stipulation or condition; a proviso.
' 
 
 32 A provision must provide for something to occur, or not to occur.
Further, the kind of provision contemplated by s 45(2)(a)(ii) is a provision capable of having a 'purpose' or an 'effect'.
This element is supplied by the deeming effect of s 45A(1) if the provision has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of fixing, controlling or maintaining, or providing for the fixing, controlling or maintaining of, among other things, a price.
By s 45A(5) , the determination of whether a provision of the required kind exists is not dependent upon form, or upon express description.
The requisite provision can be in the form of a recommendation, according to s 45A(6).
What is important is its substance.
There must therefore be sufficient substance to whatever is the result of the formation of an understanding for it to contain a provision of the required kind.
33 In Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lutovi Investments Pty Ltd [1978] HCA 55 ; (1978) 140 CLR 434, the High Court was dealing with the meaning of the word 'arrangement' in legislation other than the Trade Practices Act .
In a passage that has often been cited in judgments dealing with arrangements or understandings under the Trade Practices Act , Gibbs and Mason JJ (with whom Murphy J agreed) said at 444:
 'It is, however, necessary that an arrangement should be consensual, and that there should be some adoption of it.
But in our view it is not essential that the parties are committed to it or are bound to support it.
An arrangement may be informal as well as unenforceable and the parties may be free to withdraw from it or to act inconsistently with it, notwithstanding their adoption of it.
' 
 
 34 This passage cannot be relied upon to suggest that an arrangement or understanding under s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act need have no substance at all.
Plainly, it contemplates that there must be something of substance from which the parties can withdraw, or with which they can act inconsistently.
By their 'adoption' of whatever matter of substance is part of the arrangement or understanding, the parties will necessarily have adopted a provision that they see as an appropriate way to regulate their future conduct.
To say that they are able to withdraw from the adoption of such a provision, or to act inconsistently with it, is to say nothing more than that an arrangement or understanding is not enforceable in a court of law in the way that a contract is.
The notion of an arrangement or understanding that each party will act as it sees fit on every occasion is entirely foreign to s 45 of the Trade Practices Act .
35 Counsel for the ACCC found it necessary to grapple with the use of the word 'commitment' in the judgment of the Full Court in Apco Service Stations Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2005] FCAFC 161 (2005) ATPR 42-078 (' Apco Service Stations ') at [43] --- [47].
In that case, which concerned allegations that dealers in the Ballarat retail petrol market had been involved in an arrangement or understanding to fix the price of petrol, and which involved some of the parties to the present case, the trial judge had declined to make a finding that one dealer became committed to any price increase agreed on by the other dealers.
In addition, his Honour had made a finding that the other dealers had no expectation that the uncommitted dealer's readiness to receive telephone calls about prices meant that the uncommitted dealer would substantially match those prices.
The Full Court expressed the view that these findings led to the unavoidable conclusion that the uncommitted dealer was not a party to any understanding that it would fix its prices at the same level as the other dealers or at any particular level, or even that it would increase its prices at all.
In expressing this view, at [45], the Full Court pointed out that the appellants in that case had not disputed that the trial judge had enunciated the correct legal principles.
The trial judge had referred, and the Full Court also referred, to observations of Lindgren J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CC (NSW) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 954 (1999) 92 FCR 375 at [141] , which were specifically endorsed by a Full Court in Rural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] FCAFC 213 (2002) 118 FCR 236 at [79] .
Lindgren J said:
 'The cases require that at least one party "assume an obligation" or give an "assurance" or "undertaking" that it will act in a certain way.
A mere expectation that as a matter of fact a party will act in a certain way is not enough, even if it has been engendered by that party.
In the present case, for example, each individual who attended the Meeting may have expected that as a matter of fact the others would return to their respective offices by car, or, to express the matter differently, each may have been expected by the others to act in that way.
Each may even have "aroused" that expectation by things he said at the Meeting.
But these factual expectations do not found an "understanding" in the sense in which the word is used in ss 45 and 45A .
The conjunction of the word "understanding" with the words "agreement" and "arrangement" and the nature of the provisions show that something more is required.
' 
 
 36 In Apco Service Stations at [46], the Full Court said that the trial judge's findings amounted to no more than what Lindgren J described as a 'factual expectation', falling short of an 'understanding'.
The Full Court then referred at [47] to the judgment of Lockhart J in Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd (1980) 31 ALR 53 as a practical illustration of the proposition that a mere hope or expectation that a party will act in a particular way is insufficient to constitute an 'understanding' for the purposes of s 45(2) of the Trade Practices Act .
The Full Court pointed out that Lockhart J in Email held that, whilst sending price lists to a competitor assisted the competitor to follow the sender's prices if it chose to do so, and to do so more quickly than might otherwise be the case, in the absence of any commitment such communications were not sufficient to give rise to the meeting of minds essential to an arrangement or understanding.
The Full Court held that the same principle was applicable in the Apco Service Stations case.
Information conveyed by some dealers to the uncommitted dealer may have been useful to the uncommitted dealer in enabling him to have his franchisees check competitors' prices and know when to raise his own prices if he chose to do so, but the absence of any expectation that he would do so was fatal to the existence of any understanding.
37 In the present case, counsel for the ACCC recognised that the judgment in Apco Service Stations was binding on me.
They made the formal submission that the Full Court was in error when it required that there be some commitment, before there could be an understanding for the purposes of s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act .
The reality is that the previous authorities dealing with the content of an understanding, as distinct from its formation, provide ample support for what the Full Court said in Apco Service Stations .
More than ample support is also found in the analysis of the relevant provisions, which I have already set out in [24] --- [34].
As I have said, for the purposes of s 45(2)(a) there can be no such thing as an understanding that leaves each party to it free to do whatever it wishes.
Whatever word may be chosen to represent the essential element of an understanding for the purposes of the relevant statutory provisions, it is clear that element involves the assumption of an obligation, unenforceable in any court of law, but merely morally binding or binding in honour.
Any reservation that may have existed about this has been dispelled by the High Court, which dismissed the ACCC's application for special leave to appeal from the Full Court in Apco Service Stations on 2 June 2006.
See ACCC v Apco Service Stations Pty Ltd  Anor [2006] HCATrans 272.
At line 619, giving the judgment of himself and Hayne J, Gleeson CJ said:
 'The decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court turned not upon any controversial view of the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act but upon the Full Court's view of the facts in the light of the case as pleaded and argued by the Commission.
In the light of the facts as found, the case does not raise any issue of law suitable to a grant of special leave to appeal.
The application is dismissed with costs.
' 
 
 38 For all of these reasons, quite apart from its binding effect on me, the correctness of the Full Court's judgment in Apco Service Stations cannot be doubted.
39 As I have said, the concepts of contract, arrangement and understanding relevant to the application of s 45(2)(a) of the Trade Practices Act are concepts representing points on a spectrum of consensual dealings.
It is possible that the spectrum might be extended in one direction beyond contract, to include even more solemnly binding consensual obligations, such as deeds under seal.
It is difficult to see that the spectrum of consensual dealings could extend in the other direction beyond the concept of 'understanding', whilst still remaining relevant for the purposes of s 45(2)(a).
That end of the spectrum, therefore, lies somewhere between the outer limits of what constitutes an 'understanding' and the closest form of non-consensual dealing that could be imagined.
It is possible that this closest form is the expectation that a party will act in a particular way, engendered by that party, to which Lindgren J referred in CC (NSW) Pty Ltd at [141].
It may be in the realm of parallel conduct, even conscious parallel conduct, such as the adoption of identical prices for homogeneous products, which clearly lies beyond the realm of 'understanding'.
See the American authorities cited by Lockhart J in Email at 56 --- 57.
40 The line between what amounts to an 'understanding' for the purposes of s 45(2)(a) and what falls outside the spectrum of consensual dealings relevant to that provision will always be difficult to draw.
This is particularly so in a case such as the present, in which there is an absence of evidence of express communications from which arrangements or understandings might have been derived, and a consequent reliance upon courses of conduct, coupled with circumstantial evidence, as the only means by which the existence of arrangements or understandings can be established.
The crucial question in this case is on which side of the shadowy line delimiting 'understanding' the conduct of various parties fell.
41 Counsel for the ACCC cited numerous authorities on the question whether, for an arrangement or understanding to exist, it is necessary for the parties to have assumed mutual obligations, or whether an arrangement or understanding can exist where only one party assumes an obligation towards the other party.
It is unnecessary to cite these authorities, or to refer to them in detail, because the question is academic so far as the present case is concerned.
The ACCC has pleaded a series of arrangements or understandings to the effect that both (or all three in the case of one alleged arrangement or understanding) parties to each of them would increase their prices to the same or a similar amount at or about the same time.
It is unnecessary to consider what would have happened if the allegation had been that only one party would so increase its prices, whilst the other party was free to do whatever it saw fit.
Apart from anything else, it is obvious that it would be more difficult to sustain an allegation of an arrangement or understanding of that kind than it is to make good an allegation of the existence of an arrangement or understanding involving mutual obligations.

 The use of admissions 
 
 42 It is clear that the power given to the Court by O 18 r 4(1) of the Federal Court Rules to pronounce judgment based on the admissions of a party is discretionary.
The use of the word 'may' in the rule itself indicates this.
If authority be needed to make good the proposition that the power is discretionary, it is found in Termijtelen v Van Arkel [1974] 1 NSWLR 525 at 529 per Hope JA and at 534 --- 535 per Bowen CJ in Eq.
In that case, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales was examining three separate legislative grants of power to give judgment based on admissions arising from pleadings.
Their Honours held that each of the three grants of power was a grant of discretionary power.
43 There is some authority, apparently not conclusive, as to the circumstances in which the discretion might be exercised.
As long ago as Gramophone Co Ltd v Magazine Holder Co (1911) 28 RPC 221, the House of Lords recognised that there were circumstances in which a court should not be bound to accept admissions.
At 225, Lord Loreburn LC (with whom the Earl of Halsbury, Lord Atkinson and Lord Shaw agreed) said:
 'It is the duty of a Court to decide cases according to the truth and fact, not according to any assumed or artificial state of facts which the parties may find it convenient to present.
No doubt Courts of Law allow and indeed encourage parties to simplify litigation by making admissions and to a certain extent by waiving their rights, because, when there is a real controversy depending upon real facts, everyone ought to facilitate its authoritative settlement.
But that is a very different thing from allowing people to obtain an adjudication upon the footing that something exists or has happened which in truth does not exist, or has never happened.
The objection to such a course is most striking when the parties agree to admit as true something which lies at the root of the jurisdiction, and any judgment obtained upon the footing of its truth may be used as a weapon in terrorem against persons not parties to the admission.
A Court of Justice can never be bound to accept as true any fact, merely because it is admitted between the parties.
' 
 
 44 In Damberg v Damberg [2001] NSWCA 87 (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 at [148] --- [160], Heydon JA (as his Honour then was), with whom Spigelman CJ and Sheller JA agreed, engaged in a lengthy examination of the question whether, and to what extent, admissions or agreements between the parties could bind a court.
At [148], Heydon JA identified the problem as being 'the extent to which the parties, by their conduct of proceedings, can prevent the court from deciding a case in accordance with the law or the facts.
' At [149], his Honour acknowledged that the pleadings define the issues in a civil case, and that a party failing to plead a claim or defence will generally be unable to rely on it at a later time.
His Honour then proceeded to discuss the various ways in which admissions of fact can be made: informal out-of-court admissions at [151]; formal admissions in answer to interrogatories at [152]; and formal admissions pursuant to rules of court at [153].
His Honour pointed out that each kind of admission can be contradicted by other evidence, or the court can choose not to act on the admissions.
At [154], his Honour said:
 'A party may admit allegations made in pleadings by the opposing party, and may do so either expressly or by non-traverse.
The effect of such admissions is to narrow the issues in dispute: they can thus have the effect of restricting the evidence to be tendered and can prevent evidence being called to the contrary.
' 
 
 45 Heydon JA then mentioned concessions by a solicitor before a trial or by counsel during a trial, or admissions ordered by a court as an alternative to filing evidence to the contrary within a specified time.
His Honour also made reference to a statutory power permitting agreed statements of facts.
At [155], his Honour said:
 'There are significant limitations on the extent to which the use of the above facilities can compel a court to decide a case on a basis contrary to fact.
' 
 
 46 At [157], Heydon JA pointed out that 'the court is not bound to act on admissions made by the parties or on states of fact agreed between the parties.
' His Honour then cited the Gramophone Co case, quoting an extensive passage from the speech of Lord Loreburn LC, including the passage I have quoted at [43].
At [158] and [159], his Honour referred to two other English cases, Adams v Naylor [1946] AC 543 and Royster v Cavey [1947] KB 204, in both of which it had been held that crucial admissions on which the cases had been conducted at first instance should not be accepted, because they were contrary to fact.
By way of conclusion, at [160], Heydon JA said:
 'In short, the courts are averse to pronouncing judgments on hypotheses which are not correct.
To do so is tantamount to giving advisory opinions and to encouraging collusive litigation.
On the other hand, the courts will act on admissions of or agreements about matters of fact where there is no reason to doubt their correctness.
But they are reluctant to do so where there is reason to question the correctness of the facts admitted or agreed.
' 
 
 47 In Symes v The Proprietors Strata Plan No 31731 [2003] NSWCA 7 at [45] , Heydon JA (with whom Sheller JA and McClellan J agreed) referred to Damberg , saying:
 'It is true that there are cases where the courts are averse to pronouncing judgments on incorrect factual hypotheses, because to do so amounts to the giving of advisory opinions and to encouraging collusive litigation: see the cases discussed in Damberg v Damberg [2001] NSWCA 87 ; (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 at [148] - [160] .
However, these perils do not exist here.
It has not been demonstrated that the hypothesis that No 3 wall was common property is plainly incorrect.
There is some evidence that it was incorrect; on this appeal evidence strongly pointing in the contrary direction has been filed.
Courts commonly act on admissions in relation to matters of fact which might be disputed if the parties desired to do so, but which they have chosen to arrive at a compromise about.
' 
 
 48 Counsel for the ACCC in the present case sought to draw from these authorities the proposition that, before departing from an admission made by a party on the pleadings, the Court would need to be satisfied affirmatively that the admission was 'plainly incorrect'.
The Court could not be so satisfied if it only took the view that the applicant had failed to discharge its burden of proof in relation to the fact or event admitted.
To apply a lesser test, it was argued, would be to place an admitting respondent in no different position from a non-admitting one.
Counsel for the ACCC also referred to the public policy encouraging the settlement of litigation, which underlies the readiness of the courts to accept admissions on the pleadings as removing the admitted facts from the field of dispute.
49 In my view, to confine the non-acceptance of admissions on the pleadings to circumstances in which their falsity has been established would be too stringent a rule.
I recognise that it is important that a party whose allegations in the pleadings have been admitted ought to be entitled to rely upon those admissions.
Too great a willingness to depart from those admissions would lead to the lengthening of trials and to uncertainty in the administration of justice, both of which are very undesirable.
It seems to me, however, that Heydon JA's formulation of the test in Damberg is the appropriate one, namely that the Court can (and perhaps should) decline to act on admissions when there is 'reason to doubt their correctness', or 'reason to question the correctness of the facts admitted or agreed.
'
 50 In a case such as the present, there are particular public policy reasons for adopting this less stringent test.
The size of this piece of litigation, and the expense of retaining solicitors and counsel to conduct a full-scale defence in a long trial, provide a powerful incentive to the making of admissions, in the hope of securing leniency.
In a case in which admissions on the pleadings are made by parties who lack the resources to conduct lengthy litigation in their own defence, the Court should be more ready to put aside the admissions if they appear to be unreliable.
Further, in a case such as this, allegations are made of the existence, and the giving effect to, of arrangements or understandings between various parties.
There is no alleged arrangement or understanding the existence of which is admitted by both (or, in one instance, all three) parties to it.
At best for the ACCC, one party to an alleged arrangement or understanding has admitted the existence, and the implementation, of that arrangement or understanding.
The other alleged party (or, in one instance, two parties) to each such admitted arrangement or understanding has defended itself against the allegation.
In those circumstances, if the applicant fails to prove against the non-admitting party (or parties) the existence of the arrangement or understanding, then there is a considerable risk that the processes of the Court will be brought into disrepute, if the Court should be required to find against the admitting party that the arrangement or understanding existed and was implemented, but finds in favour of the denying party (or parties) that it did not exist.
Members of the public would have some difficulty in understanding how the Court, in a civil case, could reach such contradictory findings.
Again, this provides a substantial reason for refusing to act on admissions on the pleadings if, in the light of the evidence, those admissions may be unreliable.
51 Another factor pertinent to a case such as the present is that an admission may amount to a concession as to a matter of law, or a conclusion on a matter of mixed fact and law.
If the law is complex, or there is difficulty in determining on which side of an indistinct line the particular facts fall, it is necessary to be wary of accepting an admission conflicting with conclusions drawn on the evidence, and with the benefit of full submissions as to the law.
52 The other issue that may arise in this case, with respect to which it is necessary to look at some authorities, is the question of the admissibility against one respondent of an admission made by another respondent.
For instance, if A gives evidence of a conversation between A and B, and A's evidence is that, in the course of the conversation, B said something probative of the existence of an arrangement or understanding between B and C, the evidence is plainly admissible against B as an admission, pursuant to the exception in s 81(1) of the Evidence Act to the hearsay rule in s 59(1).
The question is whether this admission is also admissible against C. 
 53 Section 57(2) of the Evidence Act does not answer this question itself.
It provides in its own terms that it deals only with the relevance of evidence.
Indeed, it is one of the provisions in Pt 3.1 of the Evidence Act , all of which deal with relevance.
There can be no doubt that, if the statement made by B in the conversation with A is indicative of the existence of an arrangement or understanding between B and C then, consistently with s 57(2) , the Court may use the content of that statement to determine whether it is evidence that the requisite common purpose existed, and therefore that the evidence is relevant to that question.
Given its relevance, the evidence is still not admissible against C unless s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act applies.
For that to apply, it must be reasonably open to the Court to find that the statement was made in furtherance of a common purpose that B and C had.
It is clear that s 87(1)(c) can only operate if it is reasonably open from evidence other than the statement itself that the statement is made in furtherance of a common purpose.
This follows from the terms of s 87 itself.
The three paragraphs of subs (1) deal with three different situations in which a representation by one person is taken to be an admission by another person.
Subsection (2) makes provision for the prerequisites to admissibility under s 87(1)(a) and (b) to be proved by a representation by the same person who made the representation that is tendered as an admission.
The prerequisite representation may, and often will, be contained in the same statement that is sought to be tendered as an admission against the party who made it.
Section 87(2) says nothing at all about the manner in which the prerequisite to admissibility under s 87(1)(c) is to be established.
If the existence of the required common purpose could be established by the representation itself, then a statement by B that indicated that B had a common purpose with C would always be admissible against C. The statement by B would be permitted to pull itself up by its own bootstraps.
This would be an undesirable, and unintended, result of the application of s 87(1)(c).
54 Some confirmation of this proposition is available from the authorities.
On two occasions, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has said that s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (which is in the same form as s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act ) reproduces the pre-existing common law.
See R v Macraild (unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Sully, Dunford and Simpson JJ, 18 December 1997) at 9 and Watt v R [2000] NSWCCA 37 at [8] .
The pre-existing common law is found in Tripodi v R [1961] HCA 22 ; (1961) 104 CLR 1 at 7 and Ahern v R [1988] HCA 39 ; (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 100.
In both of these cases, the High Court of Australia made it clear that the statement by B could only be admissible against C if there were 'reasonable evidence' establishing the existence of the common purpose, apart from the statement itself.
I do not necessarily accept, as the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeals appears to have done, that the 'reasonable evidence' test is identical to the formulation 'reasonably open to find' preferred by the legislature.
For present purposes, however, Macraild and Watt stand as authority for the proposition that, so far as they are consistent with the terms of s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act , Tripodi and Ahern are to be taken as providing authority on the proper construction of that provision.
It follows that s 87(1)(c) must be applied on the basis that the admissibility of B's statement as against C can only be determined by reference to evidence other than the statement itself.
55 Termijtelen is authority for the proposition that the fact that an admission is a deemed admission, pursuant to a provision such as O 11 r 13 of the Federal Court Rules , does not have any effect on the question whether the Court should make a finding in accordance with it if the admission appears unreliable.
It is also possible for the Court to dispense with compliance with the requirements of O 11 r 13, under the general dispensing power found in O 1 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules .
See Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Francis [2004] FCA 487 (2004) 142 FCR 1 at [42] --- [43].
It is clear that the powers in O 18 r 4(1) and (2) respectively are discretionary; the Court is not obliged to give judgment on the basis of admissions made, whether in pleadings or otherwise.
Nor is it obliged to give such judgment without determining the other issues remaining in the proceeding.

 The parties 
 The applicant 
 
 56 The applicant, the ACCC, is established by s 6A(1) of the Trade Practices Act .
By s 6A(2)(a) , the ACCC is a body corporate and by s 6A(2)(d) it may sue in its corporate name.
The ACCC is a party given standing by s 77(1) of the Trade Practices Act to institute a proceeding for the recovery on behalf of the Commonwealth of a pecuniary penalty referred to in s 76.
Section 80(1) also gives the ACCC standing to apply for an injunction.

 The corporate respondents 
 
 57 Among the 18 respondents to the proceeding, the first eight are corporations.
They are respectively: the first respondent, Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd ('Leahy'); the second respondent, Apco Service Stations Pty Ltd ('Apco'); the third respondent, Pegasus Retail Pty Ltd ('Pegasus'); the fourth respondent, United Geelong Pty Ltd, formerly called United Fuels Pty Ltd ('United Fuels'); the fifth respondent, Brumar (Vic) Pty Ltd ('Brumar'); the sixth respondent, United Retail Pty Ltd ('United Retail'); the seventh respondent, Liberty Petroleum Pty Ltd ('Liberty') and the eighth respondent, Andrianopoulos Motors Pty Ltd ('Andrianopoulos').
58 On 4 February 2004, Leahy filed a defence in this proceeding, in which it admitted some allegations against it.
On 11 April 2005, Leahy entered into voluntary administration.
At a creditors' meeting on 6 May 2005, Leahy was placed in liquidation.
The ACCC sought the leave of the Court, pursuant to s 500(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Corporations Act '), to continue the proceeding against Leahy, on the basis that it wished to obtain declaratory relief against Leahy, and to have imposed on Leahy a pecuniary penalty, which would not be provable in the liquidation.
The only evidence about the affairs of Leahy discloses that, at the time it went into liquidation, Leahy's liabilities exceeded its assets by in excess of $1 600 000.
In the circumstances, I declined to grant leave to proceed.
The trouble and expense of proceeding to impose a pecuniary penalty on Leahy, which is extremely unlikely ever to be collected, is unwarranted.
Declaratory relief is a largely pointless exercise at the best of times, and has absolutely no point in a case in which the person about whose conduct the declaration is sought is never going to conduct any further activities.
If the function of a declaration is to record in a formal way the past acts of a corporation, so that its past conduct may be taken into account against it if it should ever contravene the law in a relevant way again, there is no point in making a declaration when the corporation has ceased to function permanently.
As will be seen, there are two natural persons who are alleged to have given rise to the contravening conduct alleged against Leahy.
If those contraventions were to be established, and declaratory relief is of any symbolic value at all, any desire for such relief would be satisfied amply by making declarations about the conduct of the two natural persons.
In the absence of leave to proceed, no relief can be sought or granted against Leahy in this proceeding.
59 On 15 August 2005, during the trial of the proceeding, the ACCC discontinued the proceeding against Pegasus.
The ACCC also abandoned its allegations of conduct contravening the Trade Practices Act in relation to Pegasus.
60 United Fuels came into existence in order to merge the business interests of Eino Heikkila (the 14th respondent), which involved wholesale and retail distribution of Shell-branded petroleum products in Geelong, and Robert James Riordan, which involved similar activities in Colac.
With encouragement and assistance from Shell, the two formed United Fuels, of which they and their respective spouses were directors.
Responsibilities were divided between them, with Mr Heikkila being in charge of retailing in Geelong, including setting prices for the United Fuels outlets, and Mr Riordan being in charge of wholesaling, and of the operations to the west of Geelong, including Colac.
With the passage of time, a personal rift developed between Mr Heikkila and Mr Riordan, and progressed to the point where they were barely able to communicate.
As a result, with the cooperation of Shell, they negotiated a settlement, under which Mr Heikkila left the business, and the petroleum retailing industry, altogether.
The wholesale distributorship was sold to an unrelated company, Triton Petroleum Pty Ltd ('Triton'), which was said to be controlled by Shell.
Mr Riordan formed United Retail, which he controlled, to carry on the retail business as the operator of a number of Shell outlets.
Robert Keith Hambrook was employed by United Fuels as its accountant, and became the financial controller for United Retail.
Mr Riordan and Mr Hambrook gave evidence on behalf of United Fuels and United Retail at the trial.
United Fuels ceased to trade on 30 September 1999, and subsequently changed its name.
Accordingly, conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act is only alleged against United Fuels up to that date.
From 1 October 1999, United Retail effectively became the successor to United Fuels in the conduct of the relevant business.
Accordingly, conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act is alleged against United Retail only after that date.
61 On 17 December 2004, Merkel J delivered judgment in the Ballarat case , to which I have referred in [23], in a proceeding in which the ACCC alleged the existence of an arrangement or understanding to fix the prices of petrol in the City of Ballarat and its surrounding area.
Among those found to be parties to the Ballarat arrangement or understanding was Brumar.
Merkel J also found that Brumar had given effect to that arrangement or understanding on some 53 occasions.
See the Ballarat case at [382].
On 17 March 2005, his Honour imposed a pecuniary penalty of $4 000 000 on Brumar in respect of those contraventions.
See Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 at [42] .
By that date, Brumar was already in liquidation, consequent upon a creditors' meeting on 17 February 2005.
Earlier, Brumar had sold its business assets for a sum exceeding $26 000 000.
Settlement of the sale occurred on 26 July 2003.
After satisfaction of secured and other creditors out of the proceeds of sale, Brumar was left with $994 400.
By the time of the liquidation, Brumar was said to have had total assets of $50 000 and creditors totalling $400.
After investigation by the liquidator, on 18 May 2005, the liquidator expressed the view that a distribution to creditors of close to 100c in the dollar would be likely, subject to the resolution of a dispute as to whether any debt in respect of the costs awarded against Brumar by Merkel J on 17 March 2005 was provable in the liquidation.
The liquidator contended that such a debt could not be proved in the liquidation.
For practical purposes, any surplus of assets over liabilities of Brumar would be more than exhausted by the payment of the penalty imposed by Merkel J and the payment of any costs ordered by his Honour.
The prospect of the ACCC recovering any pecuniary penalty from Brumar appears to be non-existent.
Accordingly, for reasons similar to those I have given with respect to Leahy in [58], I also refused the ACCC's application, pursuant to s 500(2) of the Corporations Act , for leave to proceed against Brumar.
62 There is no dispute that each of Apco, United Fuels, United Retail, Liberty and Andrianopoulos answers the description of 'trading corporation formed within the limits of Australia', and is therefore a 'corporation' for the purposes of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act to which I have referred.
Prior to their respective liquidations, Leahy and Brumar also fell within the same provision of the definition of 'corporation' in s 4(1) of the Trade Practices Act .

 The natural person respondents 
 
 63 The remaining respondents are all natural persons, each associated with one or more of the corporate respondents.
64 Each of the natural person respondents is an officer or employee of one (or, in two cases, two) of the corporate respondents.
The ninth respondent, Ian Lesley Carmichael, was Operations and Transport Manager of Leahy.
The 10th respondent, Michael John Warner, was the Corporate Accountant for Leahy.
Peter Joseph Anderson, the 11th respondent, was a director and secretary of Apco, and also Apco's General Manager.
Up to September or October 1999, the 12th respondent, Bruno Gallucci, was the Retail Business Manager of Pegasus.
From October 1999 until May 2000, the position of Retail Business Manager of Pegasus was held by Andrew Ronald Pitman, the 13th respondent.
At the same time as it discontinued the proceeding against Pegasus, the ACCC discontinued the proceeding, and abandoned its claims, against Mr Gallucci and Mr Pitman.
The 14th respondent, Eino Kalevi Heikkila (whose two given names have been joined as if they were a single name in the title to the proceeding) was a director and the secretary, and occupied the position of General Manager, of United Fuels up to 30 September 1999, when United Fuels ceased trading.
The 15th respondent, Garry Victor Dalton, was the Operations Coordinator for Geelong and Ballarat of Brumar from October 1998.
Colin James Williamson, the 16th respondent, was employed by United Fuels, in the management of one of its retail outlets, until 30 September 1999.
Thereafter, he continued to work at the same outlet, as an employee of United Retail, with the title Customer Service Leader, and additional responsibilities.
Alan Shuvaly, the 17th respondent, was National Pricing Manager of Liberty.
The 18th respondent, Christos Andrianopoulos ('Chris Andrianopoulos'), was Director of Marketing for Andrianopoulos.
65 Ian Carmichael, Michael Warner, Eino Heikkila and Alan Shuvaly filed defences, each admitting the allegations made against him and against the corporation with which he was associated.
Each gave evidence on behalf of the ACCC.
Garry Dalton gave evidence in his own defence.
Peter Anderson, Colin Williamson and Chris Andrianopoulos did not give evidence.
There was some evidence that Colin Williamson had suffered a major heart attack not long before the trial and that his poor health may have been a factor in his decision not to give evidence.

 The Geelong petrol market 
 The definition of the market 
 
 66 In the amended statement of claim, the ACCC pleaded that the Geelong retail petrol market involved the sale of petroleum products, including ULP and super-grade petrol ('Super') in the metropolitan area of the City of Geelong.
Although, on the pleadings, the extent of the relevant market was a matter of controversy, the controversy did not surface in the course of the trial.
There was no expert evidence about the structure of the market.
It was largely accepted by the parties, if not common ground, that there was a market for the sale of petroleum products, including ULP and Super, to members of the public in the Geelong metropolitan area.
It is also the case that some of the retailers of petroleum products operating in the Geelong metropolitan area had retail outlets in outlying towns around Geelong, so that price movements in the Geelong metropolitan area tended to be influential on price movements in those outlying towns, which included Meredith, Lara, Bannockburn, Drysdale, Queenscliff, Point Lonsdale, Torquay and Anglesea.
The reverse did not apply; price movements in those outlying towns did not themselves influence prices in the Geelong retail petrol market.

 The setting of prices 
 
 67 Within the Geelong retail petrol market, there were differences between the ways in which businesses were organised.
A corporation might own and operate its own retail outlets, employing its own managers and staff.
In such cases, officers of the corporation would set prices for fuel sold through the corporation's outlets, and communicate any changes in those prices to the managers and staff, usually by telephone.
Alternatively, the corporation might let retail outlets to an agent or agents, and supply them with fuel for sale to the public, again at price levels set by the corporation itself.
The agent at an outlet might be remunerated by a set percentage of the price, or a set amount of money per litre of fuel sold or, as in the case of Liberty's Geelong outlet, a flat monthly fee.
Such outlets are known as commission sites, and the people who operate them are known as commission agents.
Some corporations had a mixture of outlets they operated themselves and outlets operated by commission agents.
There were also privately-owned outlets, the operators of which set their own prices, selling to the public fuel supplied to them by a corporation which functioned for this purpose as a wholesaler.

 Branding 
 
 68 The branding of petroleum products sold in the Geelong petrol market covered a wide range.
A number of outlets sold products under one of the well-known brands of the multinational oil companies, BP, Shell, Mobil and Caltex.
In those cases, the premises at which the products were sold would be decorated with the colours, logos and names of the brands.
Fuels would come, either directly or indirectly, from the oil companies, which acted as wholesalers and distributors, even if not themselves responsible for refining the petroleum and manufacturing the fuels.
Other outlets sold petroleum products in their own names, or in the names of the corporations operating them, or for which the outlets were commission sites.
Many of those who gave evidence in the proceeding recognised a distinction, perhaps imprecise but nonetheless regarded as real, between the 'majors' and the 'independents'.
Speaking generally, the majors were regarded as those whose prices were set, or influenced strongly, by the four oil companies.
The 'independents' were generally those free to set their own prices, subject to the constraints of the wholesale prices they had to pay to procure fuels.
They tended to be the outlets selling fuels in names other than the four well-known brands, although some independents sold under the banner of the oil companies that supplied them.
Some independents regarded themselves as discounters.

 Geography 
 
 69 Before going into detail as to the roles of the corporate respondents, and other participants in the Geelong petrol market, it is necessary to have some idea of the geography of the market.
The City of Geelong lies to the south and west of Corio Bay, with its commercial centre on the southern side, close to where the coastline of the bay turns northward.
Running through the metropolitan area, south of the commercial centre, is the Barwon River, which follows a course broadly from north-west to south-east.
Geelong is linked to Melbourne by the Princes Highway, which enters the metropolitan area from the north and runs in a generally southerly direction until after it has crossed the Barwon River, where it turns generally south-westerly in the direction of Colac.
The Princes Highway goes by different names within the metropolitan area.
Thus, in Geelong North, near the western end of Corio Bay, it is Melbourne Road.
For a short distance, it becomes Keera Street.
Along the western edge of the commercial centre of Geelong, it is known as Latrobe Terrace.
South of the Barwon River, it is Settlement Road, before it again becomes the Princes Highway.
70 There are other major roads.
At Norlane, the Bacchus Marsh Road intersects with the Princes Highway.
It heads in a generally northerly direction through Meredith to Bacchus Marsh.
At the point at which the Princes Highway changes from Melbourne Road to Keera Street, it intersects with Church Street.
A short distance to the west, Church Street intersects with Ballarat Road, which heads in a north-westerly direction and becomes the Midland Highway.
From the commercial centre of Geelong, heading in an easterly direction, Ryrie Street becomes Portarlington Road, which goes through Drysdale and Portarlington to Queenscliff.
A little to the south of it and almost parallel with it in the metropolitan area is the Bellarine Highway, connecting Geelong with Point Lonsdale, via Leopold.
From the Bellarine Highway, it is possible to turn southward to Ocean Grove and Barwon Heads.
From Settlement Road, Torquay Road runs south and becomes the Surfcoast Highway.
The Anglesea Road intersects with the Princes Highway at Waurn Ponds.
West of the commercial centre, Aberdeen Street heads in a westerly direction and becomes the Hamilton Highway.

 The corporate respondents' sites 
 
 71 For all or part of the period relevant to this case, 1999-2000, Leahy supplied fuels to the public through a mixture of sites it operated and commission sites.
All of the fuels were sold, and the sites were branded, in the name of BP.
Throughout the period, Leahy's owned and operated sites were at 276 High Street, Belmont ('BP Hillford') and 694 Bellarine Highway, Leopold ('BP Leopold').
A site at 314 Murradoc Road, St Leonards ('BP St Leonards') was operated by Leahy itself until about October 1999, and thereafter was a Leahy commission site.
Until about April 2000, Leahy operated its own site at 1 Newcomb Street, Portarlington ('BP Portarlington').
From about September 1999, Leahy also operated its own site at 42 Bell Street, Torquay ('BP Torquay').
Leahy commission sites throughout the whole period were at: 77A Roslyn Road, Belmont ('BP Belmont Plus'); 2 Station Street, Norlane ('Geelong Off-Road Centre'); 8 Thompson Road, Geelong North ('BP Fairway'); 1 Forrest Road, Lara ('BP Lara'); Bridge Road, Barwon Heads ('BP Sandbar'); Point Lonsdale Road, Point Lonsdale ('BP Point Lonsdale'); and Midway Highway, Bannockburn ('BP Bannockburn').
Until the end of 1999, Leahy also had a commission site on the corner of Wallace and Wilson Streets, Meredith ('BP Meredith').
Leahy also sold fuels under the BP brand through outlets in Ballarat.
72 In the relevant period, Apco sold fuels to the public under its own Apco brand at a number of outlets.
Until about April 2000, Apco itself operated a site at 228-244 South Valley Road, Highton ('Apco Highton').
From about April 2000, Apco Highton became an Apco commission site.
Similarly, Apco operated its own site at 5 Mill Road, Lara ('Apco Lara'), until about May 2000, when the site became an Apco commission site.
Up to about April 1999, Apco sold fuels through a commission site at 367-369 Moorabool Street, Geelong South ('Apco Geelong South').
From about April 1999, that site became an Apco-operated site.
Other Apco commission sites throughout the relevant period were at: 64 Portarlington Road, Newcomb ('Apco Newcomb'); 57 Ormond Road, Geelong East ('Apco Geelong East'); 343-355 Thompson Road, Geelong North ('Apco Geelong North'); 238 Princes Highway, Waurn Ponds ('Apco Waurn Ponds'); and 41 Geelong Road, Barwon Heads ('Apco Barwon Heads').
Apco Geelong North is of some significance, because it was adjacent to the Apco head office.
Apco also had a large number of retail fuel outlets outside Geelong, including some in Ballarat.
73 The Shell branded sites in the Geelong petrol market were divided between Brumar on the one hand and United Fuels (until 30 September 1999) and United Retail (from 1 October 1999) on the other.
The Brumar sites tended to be in more prominent locations, on busier roads and to be larger and more obviously decorated as Shell sites, than the sites operated by United Fuels and United Retail.
The Brumar sites, all operated by Brumar itself, were at: 468 Melbourne Road, Norlane ('Shell Norlane'); 3 Settlement Road, Belmont ('Shell Belmont'); 202-210 Latrobe Terrace, Geelong ('Shell Latrobe Terrace'); 247 Melbourne Road, North Geelong ('Shell Speedwings'); 480 Moorabool Street, Geelong ('Geelong Car Spa'); 21 Church Street, Geelong West ('Shell Westoria'); 12 Barrabool Road, Highton ('Shell Highton'); and 107 Great Ocean Road, Anglesea ('Shell Anglesea').
Brumar also had sites in Ballarat.
The Shell sites operated by United Fuels, and then United Retail, were at: 176 Princes Highway, Waurn Ponds ('Shell Waurn Ponds'); 108 Geelong Road, Torquay ('Shell Surfcoast'); 110 High Street, Drysdale ('Shell Drysdale'); and 85 The Terrace, Ocean Grove ('Shell Ocean Grove').
In addition, there were commission sites of United Fuels and then United Retail at 137 Victoria Street, North Geelong ('Shell Victoria Street') and 44 Bellarine Highway, Point Lonsdale ('Shell Point Lonsdale').
From about February 2000, United Retail added a further site in Fellmongers Road, Breakwater ('Shell Breakwater').
74 From a date which is not certain, but probably early in the second half of 1998, Liberty operated a single site in the Geelong area, at the corner of Thompson Road and Victoria Street, Geelong North.
This was one of many sites through which Liberty sold fuels to the public throughout Victoria and elsewhere.
It sold fuel under its own Liberty brand.
75 Also throughout the relevant period, Andrianopoulos sold fuel to the public under the BP brand, through a commission site at 298-304 Princes Highway, Norlane ('BP Norlane').
This was one of a number of sites through which Andrianopoulos, or related business interests controlled by the family of Chris Andrianopoulos, sold fuels to the public in Victoria.

 Other market participants 
 
 76 The operations of the corporate respondents by no means represented the entirety of the businesses in the retail sale of fuels in the Geelong metropolitan area and surrounding towns.
To gain a more complete picture of the Geelong petrol market, it is necessary to have regard to the activities of a number of other businesses.
Outlets at which fuels were sold to the public under the brand name Mobil fell into three categories.
There were commission sites, supplied by Pegasus.
A number of sites were controlled by a company called Strasburger Enterprises (Properties) Pty Ltd ('Strasburger').
So far as Pegasus was concerned, these were reseller sites, but so far as Strasburger was concerned, they were commission sites for it.
There was also a company called Rafinc Pty Ltd ('Rafinc'), to which Pegasus sold fuel for resale to the public.
Several of the Mobil branded sites changed during the relevant period.
The site on the corner of Shannon Avenue and Aberdeen Street, Manifold Heights ('Mobil Manifold Heights') was a Pegasus commission site until about 19 July 1999, and a Rafinc site thereafter.
The site at 19 Settlement Road, Belmont ('Mobil Belmont') was a Pegasus commission site until about 10 March 1999, then a Strasburger site until 7 September 1999, then a Rafinc site until 23 August 2000, and again a Strasburger site for the balance of the relevant period.
The site at 325 Latrobe Terrace, Geelong South ('Mobil Latrobe Terrace') was a Pegasus commission site until about 10 March 1999, and thereafter a Strasburger site.
A similar change of regime, from Pegasus to Strasburger, on the same date, also occurred in relation to the site at 180 Barwon Heads Road, East Belmont ('Mobil East Belmont') and the site at 122 Torquay Road, Grovedale ('Mobil Grovedale').
The site on the corner of Barrabool and Valley Roads, Highton ('Mobil Highton') followed a similar pattern, except that it ceased to be a Strasburger site in 3 October 1999.
The site on the corner of Bacchus Marsh Road and Purnell Road, Corio ('Mobil Corio Village') was a Strasburger site until about 13 July 1999, when it became a Rafinc site.
Other Strasburger sites, operated as its commission sites throughout the relevant period, were at: the corner of Thompson Road and Naughton Avenue, Geelong North ('Mobil Geelong North'); 151 Drysdale Road, Moolap ('Mobil Moolap'); 369 Portarlington Road, Moolap ('Mobil Point Henry'); 194 Queenscliff Road, Newcomb ('Mobil Newcomb'); and 189 Bellarine Highway, Newcomb ('Mobil Gateway').
Portcliff Geelong Pty Ltd ('Portcliff') was the commission agent operating six sites for Strasburger: Mobil East Belmont (from about 26 October 1999); Mobil Grovedale (from about 26 October 1999 to December 2000); Mobil Moolap; Mobil Point Henry; Mobil Newcomb; and Mobil Gateway.
Phillip Andrew Carmichael was the sole director and the secretary of Portcliff.
He is also Ian Carmichael's brother.
77 The principal retailer of fuels under the Caltex brand (and under the Ampol brand, after it became merged with Caltex) in the Geelong petrol market was J Chisholm Pty Ltd ('Chisholm').
The directors of this company, who were both involved in its management, were the brothers Graeme Leslie Chisholm and Robert Stanley Chisholm.
In addition, Darren John Campigli was the Manager of Chisholm's Geelong depot.
Chisholm was not a respondent to the proceeding, because at all times it cooperated with the ACCC.
Both Graeme Chisholm and Darren Campigli gave evidence on behalf of the ACCC.
Chisholm operated its own sites at: 272 Princes Highway, Corio ('Chisholm Corio'); 35-37 Shannon Avenue, Geelong West ('Chisholm Geelong West'); 406 Shannon Avenue, Newtown ('Chisholm Newtown'); 168 Torquay Road, Grovedale ('Chisholm Grovedale'); and 808 Bellarine Highway, Leopold ('Chisholm Leopold').
It also sold fuel to the public through commission sites at 254 High Street, Belmont ('Chisholm Belmont') and 1-5 High Street, Bannockburn ('Chisholm Bannockburn').
78 One very prominent site carrying the Caltex brand, was under the name of the Caltex Quick Bite.
It was on the corner of the Princes Highway and School Road, a site highly visible to traffic entering Geelong from Melbourne, at or near the start of the Geelong metropolitan area.
It was a large site, described as having 16 fuel pumps.
It is not clear by whom the Caltex Quick Bite was operated.
The ACCC did not seek to gather any information about it until, at a directions hearing on 22 March 2005, counsel for Andrianopoulos and Chris Andrianopoulos complained that the ACCC had not made discovery of any information with respect to the Caltex Quick Bite.
Thereafter, the ACCC did obtain, and discover, some information, and some found its way into evidence.
79 7-Eleven Stores Pty Ltd ('7-Eleven') operated two retail fuel outlets in the Geelong petrol market at: the corner of Sydney Parade and Swanston Street, Geelong East ('7-Eleven Geelong East'); and the corner of Bellarine Highway and Coppards Road, Newcomb ('7-Eleven Newcomb').
Jacques Bodourian was the Territory Manager for 7-Eleven.
80 A partnership, known as G H and K L Primmer operated a retail fuel outlet at Meredith ('BP Meredith'), which was a Leahy commission site until the end of 1999, and a reseller of fuel supplied by Leahy from 1 January 2000.
Gordon Henry Primmer was one of the partners and the principal person involved in managing the business of BP Meredith.
81 United Petroleum Pty Ltd ('United Convenience') sold fuels to the public through one site in Bacchus Marsh Road, Corio.
United Convenience is not related to either United Fuels or United Retail.
The Operations Manager of United Convenience was Stan Kerr.
82 Perrowood Pty Ltd ('Mortimer Petroleum') sold fuels to the public under the name and brand Mortimer Petroleum, at two outlets, which it owned and operated.
They were at 495 Ballarat Road, Batesford ('Batesford Roadhouse') and at High Street, Drysdale.
David Andrew Mortimer was the General Manager of Mortimer Petroleum.
83 For approximately 10 years up to 1998, Anton Lesley Maurer was employed by Leahy.
After he had ceased to be so employed, in about March 1999, Mr Maurer became an employee of Expotech Pty Ltd ('Expotech').
He became the Retail Site Manager at an outlet through which Expotech sold fuels to the public under the BP brand.
The outlet was called 'BP Corford Express' and was situated at the corner of Melbourne Road and Surrey Road, Geelong North.
84 It is also necessary to mention Wayne Kingsley Purtell, who gave evidence at the trial on behalf of the ACCC.
Wayne Purtell was involved in the Geelong petrol market, first on behalf of Provincial Fuels Pty Ltd ('Provincial Fuels'), and subsequently on behalf of Westfuels Pty Ltd ('Westfuels'), each of which operated the Brumar sites in the Geelong area in succession, before Brumar took over those sites in 1998.
Until 15 February 1999, Wayne Purtell continued to be the Geelong Operations Coordinator for Brumar.

 Board prices 
 
 85 The practice of participants in the Geelong petrol market was to advertise their prices, particularly those of ULP, in such a way as to make them visible to passing motorists.
This was apparently a universal practice.
The advent of computer technology, and its adoption in the more modern retail outlets, enabled this to be done by means of computer-operated signs.
In such a case, an operator could change from a computer console inside the shop or office of the outlet not only the price displayed on the sign, but the price displayed on each of the fuel pumps at the outlet as well.
Simultaneous change of prices was therefore possible.
Without that technology, prices were advertised by means of sandwich boards, or other flat signs, to which could be attached (by means of hooks or otherwise) metal plates, displaying figures.
Prices on the external signs could only be changed manually, sometimes only with the assistance of a pole with a hook, enabling the operator to remove metal plates and substitute others.
In such cases, the prices on each individual fuel pump had to be changed manually as well.
The process of effecting a change of prices could involve the advertising of a different price for ULP from the prices appearing on the pumps.
Of course, it was necessary to take care not to upset customers by advertising to passing motorists cheaper prices than those for which the pumps were actually set.
In an outlet at which only one person was on duty, the timing of a price change could be affected by the volume of trade experienced.
It was sometimes necessary to wait for a lull, during which the driveway was empty of cars, before a price change could be put into effect.
Whether they were computerised or manual, the signs on which prices were advertised to passing motorists were known as 'boards', and the prices displayed on them were known as 'board prices'.

 Spotting board prices 
 
 86 Board prices were one means by which those responsible for setting the prices of fuels at retail outlets were able to gain knowledge of their competitors' prices.
In some cases, it was possible for the operator of an outlet to see the board prices of a competitor from within the operator's premises, or by walking out onto the street.
There were two striking examples of this.
Apco Geelong North and Mobil Geelong North faced each other across Thompson Road.
Because this proximity gave passing motorists a direct choice between the two, a change in the board prices at one of them would very likely be followed swiftly by a change in board prices at the other.
United Fuels, and later United Retail, had an office at 247-261 Melbourne Road, North Geelong, next door to Shell Speedwings.
Mr Riordan and, while he worked from that office, Mr Heikkila could see the board price at Shell Speedwings from the office.
87 In order to obtain a broader sample of board prices, it was common for those engaged in setting petrol prices, or other employees who reported to them, to drive around the streets observing the board prices of their competitors.
Several witnesses gave evidence of driving around, specifically to observe board prices, often more than once in a day.
Ian Carmichael, Michael Warner, Alan Shuvaly, Darren Campigli, Wayne Purtell, Phil Carmichael, Eino Heikkila and Robert Riordan all gave evidence about spotting board prices of competitors.
A circuit commonly used for this purpose involved Melbourne Road and the Princes Highway, Purnell Road, the Bacchus Marsh Road, Cox Road, Thompson Road, the Ballarat Road and Church Street.
A trip around this circuit enabled the observer to see the boards of Shell Speedwings, BP Corford Express, BP Norlane, Shell Norlane, Mobil Corio Village, Apco Geelong North, Mobil Geelong North, Liberty and BP Fairway.
If a broader sample were desired, a short extra loop, or short extensions at the northern end of this circuit permitted observation of the boards at Caltex Quick Bite and United Convenience.
Likewise, a short extra loop at the southern end of the circuit would enable observation of board prices at Chisholm Newtown in Shannon Avenue, Mobil Manifold Heights, Shell Latrobe Terrace and Mobil Latrobe Terrace.
88 In addition, it was common for those responsible for setting prices to note any board prices they passed on their daily journeys to and from work, and to instruct their employees to do likewise, and to report their observations.
Robert Riordan's morning routine involved driving from his home in Newtown to the Geelong Football Club at Kardinia Park, for his morning exercise.
His route took him down Latrobe Terrace, and enabled him to observe the board price of Mobil Latrobe Terrace, shortly after 6.00 am, when it opened.
As part of his exercise program, Mr Riordan would run around the perimeter of Kardinia Park and onto Moorabool Street, past Apco Geelong South and the Geelong Car Spa.
After the completion of his exercise program with a shower and breakfast, Mr Riordan would drive to his office, next to Shell Speedwings.
On the way, he would observe the board prices displayed at Shell Latrobe Terrace and Mobil Latrobe Terrace.
On occasions, he continued up Melbourne Road and the Princes Highway, to observe the board prices at BP Corford Express and Shell Norlane, before making a u-turn and returning to his office.
When United Retail commenced business, and Colin Williamson was given additional responsibilities as well as managing Shell Waurn Ponds, Mr Riordan also gave him a mobile phone at United Retail's expense, and instructed him to report on any board prices that Mr Williamson observed on his way to Shell Waurn Ponds each morning, and to observe board prices in the area from time to time during the day.
89 Operators who also engaged in transport of fuel often obtained information about board prices of other petrol retailers from the drivers of their trucks.
In the case of Leahy, there was evidence that the drivers would sometimes provide managers with information about prices in Melbourne.
Sometimes, customers would comment to a site manager about the level of prices at the outlets of competitors.
In general, operators of retail petrol outlets in the Geelong petrol market were keen to obtain any information they could about fuel prices.

 The pattern of petrol price movements 
 The sawtooth pattern 
 
 90 Prices of ULP in the Geelong market moved in a pattern, described as a 'sawtooth' pattern, throughout the relevant two-year period.
Prices for super were usually set at a margin above the prices of ULP.
The margin was reasonably consistent across the industry.
The sawtooth pattern is so called because, on a line graph tracing price movements from day to day, the pattern has the appearance of teeth like those of a saw-blade.
The pattern is characterised by steep rises to peaks, followed by more gentle descents to troughs.
91 A sawtooth pattern of this kind is not a feature confined to the Geelong petrol market.
Such a pattern is common in the petrol markets in comparatively densely populated areas throughout Australia.
Concern about variations in petrol prices led the federal government to request the ACCC 'to examine the feasibility of placing limitations on petrol and diesel retail price fluctuations throughout Australia', in early March 2001.
The then Minister for Financial Services and Regulation requested the ACCC to provide a report as soon as possible.
On 14 June 2001, the ACCC released a discussion paper.
In December 2001, the ACCC produced a report entitled Reducing Fuel Price Variability .
The report found that:
 'Volatility in retail petrol prices is generally confined to the major metropolitan cities and some rural towns on major highways.
The price cycles in these areas are fairly regular and frequent.
They generally exhibit a sawtooth pattern, that is, prices increase rapidly over a short period of time and then steadily decrease.

 92 Data available to the ACCC demonstrated that the amount of the variation in price cycles had increased between the first half of 1998 and the first half of 2001.
In Melbourne, for instance, the average size of the variation of price cycles in the first half of 1998 was 3.7c.
In the first half of 2001, it was 7.5c.
The ACCC also found that the duration of price cycles, the number of days between the low point of one price cycle and the low point of the next, also increased between 1998 and 2001.
In the first half of 1998, the average duration of a price cycle in Melbourne was 6.6 days, with the most common duration being seven days.
In the first half of 2001, the average duration of price cycles in Melbourne had increased to 8.9 days, although the most common duration was still seven days.

 Possible causes of the sawtooth pattern 
 Multiple causes 
 
 93 In Reducing Fuel Price Variability , the ACCC identified a number of causes of these price cycles.
It referred to international factors, such as prices of crude oil and refined petroleum products, and the exchange rates between the Australian dollar and the US dollar.
These factors were important, because, as the report said, 'movements in Australian petrol prices generally follow movements in Singapore refined petroleum product prices.
' The report also identified the level of federal and state excise and taxes as local factors.
In summarising its findings about other local factors, the report said:
 'The level and extent of competition in the petroleum industry in Australia varies between locations and over time.
It is influenced by supply and demand factors, barriers to entry, the presence of independents, the potential availability of imports, and the extent of vertical integration.
The causes of local price cycles are complex.
Price cycles appear to be influenced by many factors.
These include: competition for market share; oil company price support for their franchisees; differential wholesale petrol pricing; short-term excess product at the refineries; changes in demand; the current regulatory structure; fuel blending; possible anti-competitive practices; and movements in refiner margins.

 94 In discussion of the causes of price cycles, the report said:
 'Petrol has several characteristics which appear to make it susceptible to price volatility.
