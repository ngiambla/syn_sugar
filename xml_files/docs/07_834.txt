 HIS HONOUR: 
 
1 This is an appeal from the Veterans' Appeal Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") with respect to the late Mr Wodianicky-Heiler's disability pension.
The Tribunal affirmed a decision of the Veterans' Review Board ("the Board"), which, in turn, had affirmed a decision of the respondent Commission.
Mr Wodianicky-Heiler ("the veteran"), the applicant in the Tribunal proceedings, died before his application was heard and determined.
The proceedings before the Tribunal were continued by his widow who is also his legal personal representative, pursuant to s 126(1) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ("the Act ").
It is convenient to refer to her as "the applicant".
Background 
 
2 The veteran was born on 26 November 1946.
He served in the Australian Army from February 1967 to 30 September 1968.
He rendered operational service in Vietnam from 27 March 1968 to 27 August 1968.
After his discharge from the Army, the veteran claimed, and was granted, a disability pension for a number of conditions, namely, acute prostatitis, left inguinal lymphadenopathy, an anxiety state, malaria, bronchitis and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
3 On 11 April 2002, the veteran suffered a presumed grand mal seizure described by Dr Ell, a neurologist, as "an isolated focal golastic seizure".
Medical investigations made during April 2002 revealed a lesion in his brain identified by Dr Dorsch (a neurosurgeon) and Dr Ell as a "low grade glioma" (a kind of tumour).
On 17 April Dr Ell issued a medical certificate stating that the veteran was unfit for work indefinitely while undergoing investigation for a brain tumour.
4 On 29 April 2002 the veteran lodged an application with the respondent claiming "epilepsy" as a new war-caused injury/disease as a consequence of cerebral malaria suffered during his service.
He also claimed an increase in his rate of pension.
5 On 20 August 2002 a delegate of the respondent accepted the claim for war-caused epilepsy and increased the late veteran's disability pension to 100% of the General Rate.
In accordance with s 20(1) of the Act the delegate accepted the disability as effective from three months before lodgement, 29 January 2002.
6 Dr Mahoney, the late veteran's general practitioner, provided the Department with a diagnostic report, dated 13 May 2002, which equated the grand mal seizure with the war-caused epilepsy.
However, the consensus of medical opinion supplied since the delegate's decision is that the grand mal seizure of 11 April 2002 was due to the glioma.
7 Mr Wodianicky-Heiler had worked as a garbage truck driver for Fairfield City Council since 26 December 1986.
The information before the delegate did not indicate that the veteran had ceased work prior to the former's decision.
Accordingly, the delegate did not consider the veteran's eligibility for the Special Rate or Intermediate Rate of pension.
8 On 9 August 2002 he ceased employment with Fairfield City Council due to "ill health".
On 22 August 2002 Mrs Wodianicky-Heiler contacted the Department and informed an officer that her husband had in fact ceased work and the next day sought review of the delegate's decision from the Board.
9 The Board caused further investigations to be made and on 1 October 2003 affirmed the decision of the delegate.
The veteran then applied to the Tribunal for review of the decision affirmed by the Board.
10 The veteran died on 13 December 2003.
Mrs Wodianicky-Heiler continued the proceedings related to her husband's claim as his legal personal representative.
