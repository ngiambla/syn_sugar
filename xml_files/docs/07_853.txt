 The nature and history of the proceeding 
 
 The principal question in this proceeding is whether the first respondent's appointment of the second respondent, who is one of its employees, to the rank of Leading Firefighter was in breach of a term of an Award, or of a term of a Certified Agreement, made pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act').
If such a breach or breaches occurred, the question arises whether they resulted in the appointment being ineffective.
If the appointment were ineffective, questions arise as to whether there were consequential breaches of other terms of the Certified Agreement, relating to procedures, staffing levels, uniforms and skills maintenance of firefighters.
The proceeding was commenced pursuant to what was then s 178 of the WR Act, which has now been repealed.
A provision bearing some similarities to the former s 178 is now found in s 719 of the WR Act.
I can find no transitional provision requiring me to deal with the proceeding by reference to the amendments to the WR Act that were brought about by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth).
The proceeding is therefore dealt with on the footing that the appropriate form of the legislation is that applying at the date of commencement of the proceeding.
The same applies to other provisions of the WR Act invoked by the applicant.
The applicant is an organisation of employees, registered pursuant to the WR Act.
There is no issue about its standing to pursue the relief sought in this proceeding.
The first respondent, Country Fire Authority, is established by s 6 of the Country Fire Authority Act 1958 (Vic) ('the CFA Act') as a body corporate, capable of being sued.
The second respondent, Kristina ('Kris') Wilms, is employed by the first respondent.
There is no issue that the applicant and the first respondent are parties to and bound by the Victorian Firefighting Industry Employees Interim Award 2000 ('the Award'), an Award made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
The provisions relating to the first respondent are found in Pt 2 of the Award.
The applicant and the first respondent are also parties to and bound by the Country Fire Authority/United Firefighters Union of Australia Operational Staff Enterprise Agreement 2002 ('the Certified Agreement'), a collective agreement given statutory effect by its certification by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, pursuant to what was then s 170LT of the WR Act.
When the hearing of the proceeding began, counsel for the applicant indicated that the relief sought in paras 1, 2, 4, 10, 16, 17 and 18 of the further amended application, filed on 9 November 2004, would not be pressed.
After I had heard the evidence on behalf of the applicant, with the cooperation of the applicant and the first respondent, I referred the proceeding to mediation by a Registrar of the Court and adjourned the further hearing.
It seemed to me that there was more than simply the case of the second respondent in issue between the parties, and that the Award and the Certified Agreement as they then stood may not cover the dispute that really divided the parties.
If they could agree upon how matters similar to those in controversy in this proceeding could be dealt with in the future, this would be of great assistance to all concerned.
In addition, the second respondent was not at that stage a party to the proceeding.
It seemed to me that I ought not to determine the validity of her appointment as a Leading Firefighter without giving her an opportunity to be heard.
Unfortunately, mediation did not resolve the dispute between the applicant and the first respondent.
When the hearing resumed, I ordered that the second respondent be joined as a party.
Counsel already appearing for the first respondent also appeared for the second respondent.
During this part of the hearing, the ambit of the proceeding was confined further, so that it concerned only cl 2.9 of the Award and cll 45.8.2.2, 53.9 and 53.10 of the Certified Agreement.

 The legislation 
 
 At the relevant time, s 178(1) of the WR Act provided: 
 
 Where an organisation or person bound by an award...or a certified agreement breaches a term of the award...or agreement, a penalty may be imposed by the Court or by a court of competent jurisdiction.

 
 

Section 178(4) provided for the maximum amount of the penalty.
Section 356 provided that a court that imposes a monetary penalty under the WR Act may order that the penalty, or a part of the penalty, be paid either into the Consolidated Revenue Fund or to a particular organisation or person.
Section 413A of the WR Act provided that the Court may give an interpretation of a certified agreement on application by, among others, an organisation or person bound by the certified agreement.
These are the provisions of the WR Act under which relief was sought in the present case.

 Section 17 of the CFA Act (in which the first respondent is referred to as "the Authority") provides: 
 
 The Authority may from time to time appoint and may at any time transfer, suspend or remove-- 
 
 (a) a Chief Officer; and 
 
 
 
 (b) such number of Deputy Chief Officers as the Authority considers necessary; and 
 
 (c) such other officers and employees at the classifications and in the numbers as the Authority considers necessary.
