 
 Here the question is whether a costs order should be made against the liquidator of Jonkay Pty Ltd (in liq) in an action that was, by leave, brought against the company.
The plaintiff was the successful party.
He prefers not to apply for a costs order against the company for it has no assets.
Instead he asks that the liquidator pay his costs.
The facts may be reduced to a relatively simple statement.
On 20 September 2006 the plaintiff entered into a contract with the company to purchase for $780,000 a parcel of land at Noosaville.
The plaintiff paid the deposit of $39,000 to the company's estate agent and was to pay the balance at settlement which was due on 20 November 2006.
At the time of the contract, however, Bluestone Mortgages was in possession of the land in its capacity as mortgagee.
Therefore, the company had no authority to sell.
Moreover, the mortgagee had not assented to the sale and thus was not bound by the contract.
The liquidator was appointed on 10 October 2006.
A few days later the plaintiff's solicitor advised the liquidator of the existence of the contract and provided him with a copy.
On 25 October 2006 the liquidator wrote to the mortgagee inquiring whether it would "ratify the contract offer made [by the plaintiff] and allow [the sale] to proceed.
" The plaintiff's solicitor made a similar enquiry of the mortgagee.
The mortgagee did not adopt the contract.
Instead it put the land up for sale.
Accordingly, on 6 November 2006 the plaintiff's solicitor wrote both to the agent and to the company's solicitors advising them that the contract was terminated.
He also asked for a refund of the deposit.
Neither the agent nor the solicitors took any step to return the money.
The agent did seek instructions from the liquidator but was told that as the mortgagee had entered into possession the liquidator "now [has] no role to pay in determining whether the contract that has been exchanged can be completed".
The solicitors said they could do nothing in the absence of instructions from the liquidator.
The plaintiff's solicitor asked the liquidator to intervene.
The liquidator refused.
He explained his position in a letter dated 9 November 2006.
I will set out some extracts: 
 
 "I consider that I have no role to play in deciding whether the contract that was entered into between Jonkay Pty Ltd and Mr Jenkins can proceed.
I confirm my previous advices that you should make contact with Bluestone Mortgagees in that regard as it is they who control the subject property.
" 
 ... 
 [G]iven that I have not taken any steps in relation to the contract it follows that it is difficult for me to give instructions to the real estate agent ... in relation to how the deposit held pursuant to that contract should be dealt with.

 ... 
 I consider that it would be difficult for me to give instructions in the current circumstance without first seeking legal advice.
I confirm that I am without funds to seek such advice in the liquidation of Jonkay Pty Limited and that the mortgagee's solicitor has advised that there is no realistic prospect that any funds will become available to the company from any equity after a sale of the property.

 ... 
 I note that I have suggested to you that you seek the consent of the Mortgagee to the course of action proposed by you, but that you have been unable to do so to date.
