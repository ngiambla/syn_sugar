 
1 I delivered judgment in this matter on 18 May 2007: see [2007] FCA 708.
The trial had occupied nine sitting days.
The applicant pleaded causes of action in rectification, contractual breach of a lease, waste, unconscionable conduct contrary to ss 51AA and 51AC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and contraventions of ss 52 and 53 (g) of that Act and sought various forms of relief.
In the event the applicant was only successful on the claim that the respondent had breached a clause of the lease which required it to obtain the written approval of the applicant before undertaking significant structural alterations to the leased premises.
Damages of $34,820.00 were awarded to the applicant.
I invited submissions from the parties as to what costs orders should be made.
