 
1 On 6 November 2006 I ordered that the applicant's further amended statement of claim be struck out.
However, I granted leave to replead on or before 30 November 2006: see [2006] FCA 1441.
2 Pursuant to this grant of leave, the applicant filed a second further amended statement of claim.
On 27 April 2007 I ordered that this pleading also be struck out and said that I would hear the parties on costs: see [2007] FCA 581.
I did so because, at the end of its submissions on the second strike-out application, the respondent sought an order that its costs be paid on an indemnity basis should it be successful in its application.
In its written submissions the applicant reserved its position in relation to costs pending a review of my reasons for judgment.
When judgment was delivered I gave directions for the filing of written submissions and indicated that I would hear oral argument on 9 May 2007.
On that day senior counsel for the applicant advised the Court that certain discussions were taking place between the parties which may have rendered it unnecessary for any costs questions to be further considered and indicated that, for this reason and in an effort to avoid unnecessary costs, his client had not filed written submissions on the issue.
Further directions were given for the filing of written submissions and the hearing was adjourned to 8 June 2007.
