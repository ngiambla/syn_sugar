 Initiating Process 
 
1 The applicant (Mr Walsh) was, in 2000, a student at the University of Technology, Sydney.
He had enrolled in a course for the degree of Master of Education.
Apparently eight subjects were required to be satisfactorily completed.
In one of those subjects, Enhancing Learning Environments with Educational Technology, he failed.
Assessment for the subject involved four assignments.
Mr Walsh was awarded a passing grade in one only.
2 Mr Walsh commenced proceedings in this Court on 3 May 2006 by application.
The application provided as follows:
 
 'I bring action against the University of Technology, Sydney for breaches of consumer protection law in the provision of education services to me, under sections 51 AB, 60 and 74 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 .

 
 I seek remedies through the granting of final injunctions to award me a pass in each of three assignments in the subject "Enhancing Learning Environments with Educational Technologies", resulting in me being awarded a pass in that subject, and the consequent awarding of the degree of Master of Adult Education 
 
 A.
DETAILS OF CLAIM

 5.
In the course "Master of Adult Education" undertaken in 2000, a final injunction to be awarded that degree qualification .
' 
 
 
 (emphasis added)
 

3 Accompanying the application was a document entitled 'Affidavit'.
This document was not an affidavit strictly so called.
It contained a large amount of argument and assertion.
It is 30 pages long and consists of 95 numbered paragraphs.
Paragraphs 6, 13 and 93 --- 95 provide as follows:
 
 '6.
The remedy that I seek is to be awarded a pass grade for the on-line learning task, because my work satisfactorily met requirements including sound value and quantity, and was comparable to if not better than that of other students who were awarded a pass grade.
[under s. 80 and s. 87 of the TPA] 
 
 13.
The remedy that I seek is that I be awarded a pass grade for the case study task part 2 , because my work satisfactorily met requirements including sound value and quantity.
[under s. 80 and s. 87 of the TPA] 
 
 93.
The remedy that I seek is to be awarded a pass grade for the individual project, because my work satisfactorily met requirements including sound value and quantity 
 
 94.
The further remedy that I seek is to be awarded a pass in the subject "Enhancing Learning Environments with Educational Technologies", on the grounds that I have satisfactorily completed the subject requirements 
 
 95.
The further remedy that I seek is to be awarded the qualification of Master of Adult Education on the grounds that I have satisfactorily completed the course requirements' 
 (emphasis added)
 

4 The bulk of the document is concerned with the 'individual project' (from para 14 onwards).
Very little is said about the other two assignments.
The allegations about the individual project consist almost entirely of allegations that 'UTS behaved unconscionably'.
I will attempt shortly to come to grips with the way Mr Walsh has tried to develop his case further than the matters stated in these initial documents.
However, one thing that has not modified substantially (except in respects to which I shall refer) is the nature of the relief he seeks and the assumption which underpins it.
He thinks, evidently, that the Court has power to require directly, by some form of mandatory final injunction, that he be accorded passing grades in individual assignments and a subject and that he be admitted compulsorily, pursuant to an order of the Court, to a Master of Education degree.
Statement of Claim 
 
5 The matter was initially assigned to the docket of another judge of the Court who on 15 June 2006 directed that 'the matter proceed by way of Statement of Claim'.
6 On 1 September 2006 Mr Walsh filed an 86 page document containing 259 paragraphs which was entitled 'Statement of Claim'.
7 The judge who dealt with the matter in the first instance appears to have had some doubt whether the document filed by Mr Walsh on 1 September 2006 could be regarded as a statement of claim under the Federal Court Rules because by directions made on that day he required that: ' The respondent file and serve, by 19 September 2006, a response treating the applicant's document as a statement of facts and contentions.
' 
 
8 The time for filing that response was subsequently extended by his Honour until 30 October 2006 when the matter was transferred to my docket.
I extended time again, having directed that the matter go to mediation and, on 13 March 2007 I relieved the respondent, for the time being, from that requirement.
9 The reason that was done was because the respondent had filed a notice of motion seeking to strike out the proceedings.
That notice of motion was filed on 9 March 2007 and is the matter to which the present judgment is directed.
10 Order 11 rule 2(a) and 3 of the Federal Court Rules provide:
 
 '2 Subject to these Rules --- 
 
 
 (a) a pleading of a party shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party relies, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved.

 
 
 
 3 A pleading shall be as brief as the nature of the case admits.
' 
 
 
 

11 The document filed by Mr Walsh on 1 September 2006 fails to meet those requirements by a very large margin.
Like his earlier affidavit most of the document concerns complaints about his failure to pass the individual project.
The great bulk of the document does not consist of allegations of material fact but is a mixture of argument, personal reflection, supposition and complaint.
12 It is neither possible nor necessary to deal in every detail with this document but mentioning some salient features will set a background for later discussion.
For the purpose of the present notice of motion I proceed upon the basis that Mr Walsh can make good such factual contentions as are set out in the statement of claim.
13 The 'Facts of the case' are set out in paragraphs 1 to 85.
Paragraph 13 identifies the worth of the respective assignments.
It reads:
 
 'EdTech subject content and assessment were specified in Subject Handout Notes, which were issued to students at the start of studies.
Assessment was by 4 assignment tasks, which were known respectively as the group exercise (worth 20%), the 1 st assignment (worth 20%), the 2 nd assignment (worth 20%), and the 3 rd assignment (worth 40%).
' 
 

14 Mr Walsh had particular interests that he wished to incorporate in his studies.
It appears that the course lecturers did not share his view that these interests should play a large part in his course work or assignments.
Mr Walsh explained the position as follows (at paras 14 --- 19):
 
 '14.
The plaintiff stated that his study interest was to develop expertise to obtain professional employment producing educational animations - Education through Animation (hereafter referred to as ETA) movies 
 
 15.
The plaintiff stated that ETA was to deliver visual learning - in contrast to lectures and books that were overwhelmingly verbal.
It was to cater for situations where visual provided significant benefits - eg visual type content, people with a preference for visual over verbal, and helping to overcome language translation problems - and deliver a range of further educational benefits.
He intended to systematically deliver the entire content of appropriate courses visually with minimal onscreen text, and only then add a brief voice-over 
 
 16.
The plaintiff stated his interest in one ETA application only - brief movies to be presented during undergraduate science and engineering lectures, to enhance explanations.
He intended to do this in China, where the total benefits of ETA figured to be very high; and to obtain professional employment there producing ETA movies for universities 
 
 17.
Both teachers displayed strong and unrelenting hostility towards the plaintiff's interest in ETA, in class and in assessment feedback for the 1st and 2 nd assignments.
Mr Housego also displayed strong personal hostility towards the plaintiff in class, and reportedly denigrated him outside the class 
 
 18.
For the plaintiff EdTech was by far the most important subject in the course.
It was the subject most directly related to his professional learning requirements, and the subject that figured to be most important for his future professional credibility if he were to find future employment producing ETA movies.
Therefore he put very considerable effort into the subject, including all of the assignment tasks 
 
 19.
For the plaintiff ETA has particular significance.
It is the only prospect for new professional employment that he has been able to identify during several years of investigation.
It appears to offer genuine opportunities because of the high value that ETA can deliver.
The plaintiff would appear to be well-positioned to obtain employment through already having some level of expertise in multimedia, in China, and in engineering and science' 
 

15 The factual allegations made with respect to the group exercise and first and second assignments (Mr Walsh passed the 1 st assignment) each of which made up 20% of overall marks, are contained in paras 20 to 22 which read as follows:
 
 20.
For the EdTech group exercise the class was divided into 2 teams of 5 students each, who carried out a debate on a UTS email bulletin board system.
The plaintiff carried out all required tasks, and submitted them by the due dates.
Assessment feedback was by Mr Housego and comprised only comments on a review of the exercise that the plaintiff was required to provide (i.e.
not on his assignment performance).
No assessment result (eg not even a fail grade or a 0% mark) was provided 
 
 21.
The EdTech 1 st assignment was a set task in the form of an essay.
The plaintiff completed this task and submitted it by the due date.
Assessment feedback was by Ms Hayes and comprised only negative and hostile comments towards ETA.
Assessment results were provided in the form of a grade (pass) but not a mark 
 
 22.
The EdTech 2 nd assignment was a set task in the form of an essay.
The plaintiff completed this task and submitted it by the due date.
Assessment feedback was by Mr Housego and comprised only negative and hostile comments towards ETA.
No assessment result was provided' 
 

16 Like the earlier affidavit, however, the bulk of the statement of claim, both in this section and others, is concerned with his complaints about the way his third assignment was treated.
17 Mr Walsh sets the scene in paras 23 and 24:
 
 '23.
The EdTech 3 rd assignment was an individual project stipulated in the Subject Handout Notes in the following words.
"The aim of this assignment is the [sic] reflect critically on the use of educational technology for learning.
You will negotiate your own project and how it will be assessed.
Projects must be negotiated by the end of Block 2 Friday 5 th May.
A learning contract is useful for documenting your proposal.
Length --- minimum 3000 words.
Due date --- Friday 2 nd June" 
 
 24.
The plaintiff had stated to both teachers on the first day of classroom sessions (7 March 2000) his interest in producing an essay of practical value for his ETA intentions for the 3 rd assignment.
Mr Housego expressed strong opposition to this idea from the very first day, and throughout the classroom sessions strongly recommended a range of alternative topics, all of which were unsuited to the plaintiff's interests' 
 

18 It appears that, notwithstanding 'strong opposition' to Mr Walsh's proposals he had not by the end of classroom sessions for the subject on 5 May 2000 modified his position and he insisted upon a particular topic of his choosing.
The project later submitted by him was not judged to be satisfactory.
He was requested to resubmit the assignment, first by one of the lecturers who had been responsible for assessing it and later by the Dean of Education of UTS after Mr Walsh had lodged a complaint with the registrar.
19 Mr Walsh decided that he would not resubmit the assignment.
He explained why that was so in his statement of claim as follows:
 
 '61.
The plaintiff has failed to resubmit the 3 rd assignment, motivated by the following considerations 
 
 62.
First, the plaintiff considered that resubmission would incur the grave risk of the plaintiff losing legal ownership --- at a shared public access level --- of ETA intellectual property that he had produced and which was essential to practice in the field of ETA.
If this occurred, the plaintiff could be unable to obtain employment in the field of ETA 
 
 63.
Second, it was not even feasible to produce much of the content demanded by Ms Hayes until some future date, when ETA had been defined at a technical level and there had been experimentation and a history of observation for ETA 
 
 64.
Third, the plaintiff was not confident of being awarded a pass regardless of what he did.
Despite having complied with improper and highly excessive demands, he had been failed.
He had no grounds for believing that he would be passed if he complied with the major new resubmission demands 
 
 65.
Fourth, the plaintiff considered that the request for resubmission constituted a demand for slave labour.
The tasks proposed were irrelevant to his interests, and hence of no learning benefit.
The work would be for zero payment, because assignment requirements had already been met in full.
The work required would be considerable 
 
 66.
Fifth, resubmission based on the new demands was distasteful.
Ms Hayes was fully aware that the focus and philosophy of the article referred to were strongly opposed to the plaintiff's focus and philosophy for ETA.

 
 67.
No action occurred in relation to this dispute between March 2001 and January 2004' 
 

20 The reason for inaction between March 2001 and January 2004 is not disclosed by the statement of claim.
During 2004 there were apparently efforts within UTS to deal further with the matter but without resolution.
21 Following the 'Facts of the case' from paras 86 to 216 is a large section entitled 'Causes of action'.
This section commences with an 'Outline' which in para 92 summarises the relief claimed as follows:
 
 '92.
The plaintiff alleges that all causes of action brought by him justify him being awarded the remedies he seeks under s87 of the Trade Practices Act (1974) --- a pass grade in all assignment tasks, EdTech, and the degree of Master of Education in Adult Education ' 
 (emphasis added) 
 

22 In para 93 Mr Walsh advances the following with respect to the group exercise and second assignment:
 
 '93.
It is argued on multiple grounds that the group exercise and 2 nd assignment --- neither of which were awarded any assessment grade or mark --- be awarded pass grades .
' 
 (emphasis added)
 

23 After advancing some matters with respect to the third assignment he says at para 101:
 
 '101.
It is argued that passes should now be awarded in all plaintiff assignment tasks , and consequently that the plaintiff be awarded a pass in EdTech , and hence be awarded the degree of Master of Education in Adult Education' 
 (emphasis added)
 

24 Paragraph 102 argues that UTS has wrongfully taken Mr Walsh's intellectual property 'by the use of (implied) threats of assignment failure'.
Then para 103 states:
 
 'It is argued that respondent actions are consistent with deliberately and wrongfully demanding and taking possession of all possible intellectual property associated with ETA, including in contravention of its own intellectual property rules and policies.
In order to protect his shared public ownership interests, the plaintiff therefore seeks examination under oath of relevant respondent servants in relation to respondent dissemination of such property, and in relation to any awarding of such property into private legal ownership' 
 

25 Paragraph 104 erects a contention that UTS was not acting alone --- but at the direction of a third party, who has been concealed.
It says:
 
 '104.
It is argued that respondent actions are so inconsistent with expected behaviour of universities and their staff, and with any responsible institution and people in general, that the respondent appears to have been acting under direction --- acting under the direction of some concealed third party.
