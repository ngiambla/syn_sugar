1 This judgment concerns a notice of motion seeking summary judgment under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the FC Act').
The notice of motion has been filed by the first and second respondents to the proceedings and is supported by the third respondent.
2 The proceedings were commenced by an 'application for an order of review' ('the application') under Order 54 of the Federal Court Rules .
The application seeks to invoke the grounds of review set out in ss 5 , 6 and 7 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act').
Indeed it seeks, indiscriminately and without any attempt at specificity, to invoke almost each and every possible ground of review provided in those provisions.
3 The decision with respect to which review is sought is contained in a letter dated 8 January 2007 written to the applicant, Mr Rahman, concerning a complaint which he made to the third respondent, the Privacy Commissioner, on 21 December 2006.
The letter to Mr Rahman was signed by Ms Anna Dobkin, an Assistant Compliance Officer in the Compliance Section of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.
4 Mr Rahman's complaint was that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited ('CBA') (of which the first and second respondents are officers) had by the conduct of the first and second respondents disclosed his personal information to Centrelink.
In her letter of 8 January 2007 Mr Dobkin informed Mr Rahman that it appeared his complaint did not constitute a breach of 'the privacy principles' and that she was therefore declining to investigate it.
5 In a letter dated 1 February 2007, sent to Mr Rahman before the application was filed (on 5 February 2007) Ms Dobkin reversed her earlier decision.
She advised Mr Rahman, who had protested by letter faxed on 15 January 2007 against her earlier response, that she would make 'preliminary enquiries' into his allegations.
6 The term 'preliminary enquiries' comes from s 42 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ('the Privacy Act ').
7 Section 42 provides:
 
 '42 Preliminary inquiries 
 
 
 Where a complaint has been made to the Commissioner, or the Commissioner accepts a complaint under subsection 40(1B), the Commissioner may, for the purpose of determining: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) whether the Commissioner has power to investigate the matter to which the complaint relates; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) whether the Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, decide not to investigate the matter; 
 
 
 
 
 make inquiries of the respondent.
' 
 

8 The inquiries to be made to decide whether there was power to investigate the matter, or it should not be investigated as a matter of discretion, were inquiries, in effect, of CBA.
9 In evidence before me on the notice of motion the first respondent, Ms Ashpole, deposed to the following:
 
 '6.
On 12 August 2006, the Bank was served with a section 196 notice from Centrelink ("statutory notice").
The statutory notice required the production of statements for loan account number 253350500 ("account statements") held by Mr Rahman, from 1 August 2005 to date.
A copy of that notice appears at pages 1 to 3 of exhibit LRA-1.
' 
 

10 The notice from Centrelink was in the following terms:
 
 'Dear Sir,Madam, 
 
 Account Information --- Rahman --- Loan Number 253350500 
 
 Your assistance is requested in providing information that is relevant to a person's entitlement to social security payments.
