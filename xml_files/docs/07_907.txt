 
1 The Migration Review Tribunal found that the appellant, who had previously held a student visa (Subclass 560) ('the visa'), ' failed to substantially comply with ' a condition to which the visa was subject, Condition 8202.
The Tribunal affirmed a decision of the Delegate of the first respondent, made pursuant to reg 572.212 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations') (then in force), to refuse to grant the appellant a further (temporary) student visa.
Regulation 572.212 required the appellant to have "complied substantially" with the conditions to which the visa last held by him was subject.
Condition 8202 required the appellant to satisfy each of a number of conditions, one of which was to achieve an academic result that was ' certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory ' (Item 8202(3)(b) in Sch 8 of the Regulations).
There was no such certification.
2 Fundamental to the Tribunal's decision was its understanding that the relevant test of "substantial compliance" was as discussed in Baidakova v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436 at 6.
The Tribunal applied the "substantial compliance" test to Condition 8202(3)(b).
However, the requirement in Condition 8202(3)(b) to provide a certificate cannot, logically, be satisfied by substantial compliance.
Either Condition 8202(3)(b) is satisfied or it is not; either there is a certificate of an "at least satisfactory" academic result or there is not ( Jayasekara v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 167 ; (2006) 156 FCR 199 per Heerey and Sundberg JJ).
It is not in dispute that the education provider, the University of Sydney ('the University') had not provided the necessary certificate.
There was no compliance with Condition 8202(3)(b).
There is ' no scope for operation of the distinction between strict compliance and substantial compliance ' in determining whether Item 8202(3)(b) of Sch 8 of the Regulations is satisfied ( Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 261 at [10] , cited in Jayasekara at [5]).
3 The appellant did not meet the requirements of Condition 8202.
4 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.
His application was dismissed: Jiang v Minister for Immigration  Anor [2007] FMCA 215.
