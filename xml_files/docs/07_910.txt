 
 1 The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision, made personally by the former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on 17 October 2006, in which she refused to grant a visa to the applicant.
The Minister's decision was made pursuant to s 501(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").
Jurisdiction to review the decision is conferred on the Court by s 476A(1)(c) of the Act .
2 The circumstances in which the Minister came to make the decision are somewhat unusual.
They date back to September 1982 when the applicant, as a member of the Lebanese Phalange Militia entered the Sabra and Shatilla Palestinian Refugee Camp in West Beirut.
A massacre of civilians ensued.
The applicant has, at various times, both admitted and denied that he participated in this massacre.
It is not necessary, for present purposes, to determine whether or not he killed civilians.
3 In December 1993 the applicant came to Australia.
In March 1994 he applied for a protection visa.
His application was refused by a delegate of the Minister in August 1994.
He appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal.
In August 1995 the Tribunal accepted that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution should he return to the Lebanon but held that he was not able to avail himself of the protection provided by the Refugee Convention by reason of the provisions in Articles 1F(a) and 1F(b) which excluded those involved in war crimes or crimes against humanity or in serious non political crimes.
The Tribunal's decision was based on findings that the applicant had taken part in the massacre in the refugee camps.
4 Over the next decade the applicant made a series of applications to the Minister, delegates of the Minister, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and this Court in order that he might be able to remain in Australia.
It is not necessary to rehearse all of these applications or their outcomes.
5 The genesis of the present application was the detention of the applicant, as an unlawful non citizen, on 22 May 2006.
A week later his migration agent lodged an application for a Child (residence) Class BT Visa on his behalf.
It was acknowledged that the applicant did not meet the relevant criteria and it was frankly conceded that the purpose of the application was to facilitate ministerial intervention pursuant to s 351 of the Act .
An application was also made for a Bridging Visa E. A delegate of the Minister refused the application for the Bridging Visa.
This decision was then challenged in the Migration Review Tribunal.
That Tribunal remitted the application to the department for reconsideration.
While the reconsideration was pending the department issued a notice of intention to consider the refusal of his application under s 501(1) of the Act .
The applicant was advised that:
 "In reaching a decision whether to refuse [the] visa the Minister or her delegate will also have regard to whether refusing his visa application and returning him to Lebanon would constitute a breach of Australia's international obligations under the Refugee Convention, the Convention Against Torture (CAT) or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
It is important that you specify in detail, any reason why you believe that Australia would be breaching its international obligations by returning [the applicant] to the Lebanon.
" 
 

This notice was given on 13 June 2006.
On 6 July 2006 the applicant's solicitors made detailed and lengthy submissions on his behalf.
One section of these submissions was devoted to Australia's international obligations.
It was contended that:
 
 "Australia is subject to non refoulment obligations prohibiting the return of a person to a country where, as a necessary or foreseeable consequence of their removal or deportation from Australia, the person would face a real risk of violation of their rights under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) including the Article 6 right to life, Article 7 right to freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or the death penalty.
Further, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or degrading treatment of punishment (CAT) places an absolute prohibition on refoulment on where there are "substantial grounds for believing (the person) would be in danger of being subject to torture.
" 
 
 It is submitted that there is a strong possibility that [the applicant] may well face persecution and/or torture if he is forced to return to Lebanon ... 
 
 ... 
 
 It is therefore submitted that there continues to be a "real chance" that [the applicant] will face persecution in Lebanon on the basis of his previous claims ..." 
 

(Emphasis in original).
This section of the written submission concluded with the observation that Australia "may breach its non refoulment obligations under the ICCR (sic) and the CAT should a decision be made to return [the applicant] to the Lebanon.
"
 
6 The applicant's written submissions were considered by officers of the department.
By letter dated 25 July 2006 addressed to the applicant's solicitors the applicant was advised:
 
 "Please find attached an assessment of Australia (sic) potential International Treaty Obligations in the case of your client ...
This assessment has been developed for consideration by the decision-maker in regard to your client (sic) application for a Bridging Visa E in connection with a dependant child application and is provided to you to facilitate any comments you wish to make in regard to the assessment.
" 
 

The applicant was also invited to furnish any additional information which he might wish the decision-maker to consider.
7 The attached assessment summarised the applicant's claims and then identified a series of relevant considerations.
Those considerations were framed as questions and adjacent to each question was a box which enabled the author to answer the question either "yes", "no" or "refer to comments".
Under the heading "Non Refoulment Obligations" questions 12, 13 and 14 read:
 
 "12.
Is there any evidence that the person will be killed?

 
 13.
Is there any evidence that the person will be tortured?

 
 14.
Is there any evidence that the person will face cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment?
" 
 

Each of the questions was answered "yes" and "refer to comments".
The comments made in relation to these questions were:
 
 "Q12 
 Given the volatile nature of Lebanese politics, as well as the uncertainty created by recent Israeli military exercises in Lebanon, there is a risk that [the applicant] might be killed upon return to Lebanon.
There is, however, no evidence to support his claims that he would be targeted by pro Syrian forces in Lebanon as a result of his past activities as a member of the Lebanese Forces.
He has failed to provide evidence that he has been sufficiently high profile (sic) within the Lebanese Forces to attract that sort of attention upon return to Lebanon from forces subservient to Damascus.
There is no evidence available to supports (sic) his claims that he would be targeted by Palestinians in Lebanon as a result of his participation in the Sabra and Shatilla massacres.

 
 In general terms, while there has been harassment of members and supporters of the Lebanese Forces under previous pro Syrian governments in Lebanon, since the elections in 2005 there has been a lack of country information supporting claims of ongoing detention, torture or killing of such Lebanese citizens.

 
 Q13  14 
 For the same reasons stated in response to Q12 there is no significant, current evidence that [the applicant] would face torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment if returned to Lebanon apart from country information which predates the outcome of the 2005 election.
" 
 

8 Immediately after the comments the following passage appeared:
 
 "NON REFOULMENT OBLIGATIONS ASSESSMENT 
 
 CAT Are there substantial grounds for believing that the person will be in danger of being subjected to torture if returned to the Country of reference?

 
 ICCPR Is there a real risk that the person will face a violation of their fundamental human rights under Article 6 or 7 of the ICCPR as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of return to the country of reference?
" 
 

Both of these questions were answered "no".
The following comments followed:
 
 "While the violent and volatile nature of Lebanese politics since 1975 means that there will always be some risk of [the applicant] being targeted for killing or torture, the political situation in Lebanon as a result of the withdrawal of Syrian military forces and the outcome of the national elections in 2005 has substantially changed.

 
 The reduced incidence of political violence in Lebanese politics has significantly reduced the risk of [the applicant] facing violation of his fundamental rights under Article 6 (Right to Life) or Article 7 (Freedom of Torture and Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment) of the ICCPR if he returned to Lebanon.

 
 Similarly, there are not substantial grounds for believing that [the applicant] would face torture if returned to Lebanon given the lack of evidence in the form of Country Information that in the aftermath of the 2005 elections, members and supporters of the Lebanese Forces face torture, detention and imprisonment by the Lebanese Government.

 
 The current uncertainty in regard to the future stability of Lebanese politics giving the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and the potential for this conflict to spark a return of sectarian violence in Lebanon means that it is not possible to rule out the possibility that [the applicant] would be targeted for killing and/or torture as a result of his past, and potentially future, membership of the Lebanese Forces.
" 
 

9 The applicant's solicitors responded with a further lengthy and detailed submission in a letter dated 8 August 2006.
The letter acknowledged receipt of the department's "preliminary assessment" and continued:
 
 "It is primarily submitted that there are substantial grounds for believing that [the applicant] faces a real risk of violation of his fundamental human rights, including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ... and the Convention Against Torture ..., should he be returned to Lebanon.
Any suggestion to the contrary in the Department's Assessment reflects a failure to appreciate the correct legal test as the factual findings made by the Department indicate that Australia's non refoulment obligations are engaged in [the applicant's] case notwithstanding a discrete, global conclusion of the contrary.
" 
 

Later in the letter attention was directed to what was meant by a "real risk" of harm within the meaning of the International Instruments.
It was submitted that:
 
 "International case law, including the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in Soering v The United Kingdom ... has established that the obligation of non refoulment arises where there is a "real risk of exposure" to violation of the ICCPR right in question.
The European Court of Human Rights has identified the correct legal test to be applied in determining the obligations of State act as to be whether, 
 
 
 
 "Substantial grounds have shown for believing that the person concerned, if expelled, faces a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country" ... 
 
 
 
 The relevant risk is required to be "real", "foreseeable" and "personal".
The meaning of "real" in this context is something more than "mere possibility of ill treatment" but need not amount to "certainty" ...
In the CAT context, international bodies have found that the risk "must be assessed on grounds that go beyond mere theory or suspicion" but need not be "highly probable" ..." 
 

It was then submitted "that the Department's own preliminary assessment disclose[d] a level of recognised risk that satisfies the international law requirement that there be a risk that is greater than "mere possibility" but less than "certainty".
" 
 
10 Following receipt of the solicitor's letter an issues paper was prepared by an officer of the department for consideration by the person who was to determine whether or not to refuse the applicant's visa application under s 501(1) of the Act .
The issues paper summarised the initial assessment and the response to it by the applicant's solicitors.
In particular, it summarised the submissions relating to the proper construction of the "real risk" test.
The issues paper continued:
 
 "[115] Departmental legal advice was sought on the issues raised by [the applicant's solicitors].
This advice indicates that [the applicant's] agents relied in their submissions on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) jurisprudence, to which Australia is not a party.
It stated that whilst it is useful in interpreting similar obligations in instruments to which Australia is a party, it is "by no means determinative".
In addition, they did not see anything quoted by [the solicitors] from the ECHR as suggesting that the department had applied the test for refoulment incorrectly.

 
 [116] The advice also refuted the interpretation by [the solicitors] of UNCAT's general comment Number one, and stated that there did not appear to be anything wrong in the way the department had applied the test for non refoulment.
Based on this advice the department prepared a reassessment of Australia's International Treaty Obligations.

 
 [117] That assessment clarifies the first by stating that there would be "remote possibility, of [the applicant] facing torture and/or death if returned to Lebanon and that it is not possible to rule out this possibility given the volatile nature of Lebanese politics.
The conclusion reached in the initial assessment was that there was a "possibility" of torture and/or death, there was no "real risk" of this given recent changes in Lebanon and therefore the refoulment obligation of the CAT and ICCPR are not invoked in regard to [the applicant] possible return to Lebanon.
" 
 
 [118] The United Nations Human Rights Committee requires that violation of fundamental rights be a "necessary and foreseeable consequence" of an individual's removal when determining whether there is a "real risk".
The Department assessed that country information did not support the view that [the applicant] would face violation of his rights under Article 6 or 7 or the ICCPR as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of his removal.
Nor did the Department accept that the recent political volatility in Lebanon make (sic) the risk any greater than prior to the conflict.

 
 [119] The Departmental assessment also stated that [the applicant's] representatives have provided no evidence that he was anything other than a junior officer and in this context the threat of torture and or death to [the applicant] upon return to Lebanon remains "merely a possibility or remote risk"".

 

11 On 4 October 2006 the then Minister declared that she reasonably suspected that the applicant did not pass the character test and that he had not satisfied her that he passed the character test.
She decided to exercise her discretion under s 501(1) of the Act to refuse his application for a Bridging Visa E and refused to grant the visa.
12 On 11 October 2006 the Minister published a statement of reasons for her decision.
Relevantly, the Minister dealt with Australia's international treaty obligations as follows:
 
 "[31] I gave particular consideration to the issue of [the applicant's] safety if he were removed to Lebanon.
An International Treaties Obligation Assessment (ITOA) was undertaken in relation to [the applicant], which stated that while there was a remote possibility of the risk of torture and/or death if the applicant was to be returned, there was no real risk given the changes in Lebanon since the formation of the present elected government in July 2005.

 
 [32] I also took into account that the ITOA concluded that country information did not support the view that torture or death would be a "necessary and foreseeable consequence" of [the applicant's] removal from Australia, which is the test for risk set by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
The assessment also concluded that the recent conflict in Lebanon would not make that risk any more likely than prior to the conflict.

 
 [33] In view of this I accept that returning [the applicant] to the Lebanon in the present circumstances would not contravene Australia's international obligations.
I gave this consideration moderate weight.
" 
 

13 The Minister formed the view that the applicant participated in killing civilians during the 1982 massacre at the refugee camps.
She further found that he did not pass the character test because he was not of good character having regard to his past general conduct: see s 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Act .
The Minister said that, in reaching her decision, she had "considered all relevant matters including (1) an assessment against the character test as defined by s 501(6) of the Migration Act 1958, (2) Ministerial Direction 21 under s 499 of that Act and (3) all other evidence available to me, including evidence provided by, or on behalf of, the applicant.
"
 THE LEGISLATION 
 
14 Section 501(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may refuse to grant a visa to a person if the person does not satisfy the Minister that he or she passes the character test.
The character test is defined in s 501(6), it provides that a person does not pass the character test, inter alia, if the person is not of good character having regard to the person's past and present general conduct.
Section 499 of the Act empowers the Minister to give written directions to decision-makers about how they are to exercise discretionary powers under the Act.
Decision-makers are bound to comply with such directions.
The Minister him or herself is not so bound when exercising powers personally: see Rocca v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 87 ALD 529 at 544 [57].
Decisions made by a delegate of the Minister under s 501(1) are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; decisions made personally by the Minister are not: see s 500(1).
THE TREATIES 
 
15 Article 4 of the CAT provides that:
 
 "No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
" 

16 Article 6 of the ICCPR provides that:
 
 "Every human being has the inherent right to life.
This right shall be protected by law.
No one shall be arbitrately deprived of his life.
" 

17 Article 7 of the ICCPR provides that:
 
 "No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
" 
 THE APPLICANT'S CASE 
 
18 The applicant accepts that none of the relevant treaty obligations has been incorporated in Australian domestic law.
There is, therefore, no statutory obligation on the Minister or other decision-makers under the Act to give effect to those obligations when making decisions under the Act.
The applicant, however, argues that, because the Minister determined that she "would follow Direction No 21" and that she would take into account, as a relevant consideration, the question of whether the applicant could be returned to the Lebanon consistently with Australia's treaty obligations, she was obliged to have regard to the CAT and ICCPR, properly construed, when exercising the discretion conferred on her by s 501(1) of the Act.
The applicant contends that the Minister made two errors in dealing with the treaties.
