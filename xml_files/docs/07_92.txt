 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The first plaintiffs (the Liquidators) are the liquidators of the second plaintiff (Terraplanet).
The Liquidators have applied for leave under s 436B(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) to appoint themselves as administrators of Terraplanet.
On 21 December 2007 I granted that leave.
These are my reasons for having done so.
2 Section 436B falls within Pt 5.3A of the Act which deals with the administration of a company's affairs with a view to its executing a deed of company arrangement (DOCA).
Section 436B(1) provides that a liquidator or provisional liquidator of a company may by writing appoint an administrator of the company if he or she thinks that the company is insolvent, or is likely to become insolvent at some future time.
However, a liquidator or provisional liquidator may appoint himself or herself as an administrator under that provision only with the leave of the Court.
BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
3 Terraplanet carried on business as a publisher of magazines, graphic design and pre-press service provider, internet web site designer and developer and related businesses.
It was admitted to the Official List of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on or about 12 May 2000.
However, Terraplanet's securities were suspended from being traded on the ASX in November 2002.
4 On 3 December 2002, Terraplanet and two subsidiary companies, Terraplane Press Pty Ltd (Press) and Terraplane Imaging Pty Ltd (Imaging), by resolutions of their respective boards of directors, appointed the Liquidators as administrators of the respective companies pursuant to s 436A of the Act.
5 The Liquidators, in their then capacity as administrators, negotiated a contract for sale of most of the business assets of Terraplanet and Press.
The sale was completed on 6 January 2003.
The sale price was $951,000 plus GST, of which $682,321 was paid to the secured creditor, Quality Web Australia Pty Ltd (Quality).
6 On the following day, 7 January 2003, at the meeting of the creditors of Terraplanet convened under s 439A of the Act, the creditors resolved under s 439C(c) of the Act that Terraplanet be wound up.
The creditors also resolved that a committee of inspection be appointed.
By the operation of s 446A(4) of the Act, Terraplanet was taken to have nominated the Liquidators to be liquidators for the purposes of the winding up, and the creditors were taken not to have so nominated anyone.
7 In their capacity as liquidators, the Liquidators sought, under s 588FF of the Act, to recover as an unfair preference an amount of $509,871 from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (DCT).
DCT joined the directors of Terraplanet as parties to the proceeding pursuant to s 588FGA of the Act.
The proceeding was settled in December 2005 for $272,000, on the basis that each party bear its own costs.
DCT released the directors from any potential claims for insolvent trading.
8 The Liquidators also launched a proceeding against Quality in relation to payments made to Quality totalling $445,754.
Quality had been granted a fixed charge over assets of Terraplanet on 15 November 2002 (not long before the appointment of the Liquidators as administrators).
Apparently, the dispute concerned pre-charge payments made by Terraplanet to Quality.
The proceeding was settled in November 2005 for $70,000, on the basis that each party bear its own costs.
9 Creditors of Terraplanet had previously been advised that there was unlikely to be any distribution to ordinary unsecured creditors unless the proceedings against DCT and Quality resulted in substantial recoveries.
