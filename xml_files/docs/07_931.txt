 
1 Before the court are three appeals pursuant to s 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).
Each appeal is against an assessment under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) ("the FBTA Act "), the three years in question being those ended 31 March 2001, 2002 and 2003.
The only questions which the court is required to determine in each of the appeals are whether the applicant was, at the relevant time, 
 
 (a) a "charitable institution" within the meaning of s 65J(1)(b) of the FBTA Act ; or 
 (b) a "non-profit association, ... established for community service purposes" within the meaning of s 65J(1)(j) of the FBTA Act .


If the answer to either of these questions is yes, the applicant will be a "rebatable employer" for the year in question.
The proceeding was conducted on the basis that no distinction was to be made between the years to which the three appeals relate.
2 The applicant is a not-for-profit company, limited by guarantee, which provides private health insurance.
It is not suggested that such an activity is charitable as such; rather, the applicant's claim to be a charitable institution is based upon the limitation, in its rules, of the class of persons whom it may accept as members of the fund which is conducts.
Broadly, that class is confined to serving members of the Navy (and other arms of the services) who have dependants and other identified categories of persons having particular connections with the Navy (or the other arms).
The applicant contends that its objects are thus to promote the efficiency of the Defence Forces and thereby manifest a concern with the benefit of the community as a whole sufficient to invoke the fourth class of charitable purposes identified in Lord Macnaghten's speech in Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel [1891] AC 531.
THE FACTS 
 
3 The applicant's evidentiary case commences on 4 November 1954, when, at a meeting of the Navy Central Canteen Fund Committee, it was resolved to recommend that a Naval Health Benefits Society be formed and that the Central Canteen Fund make a grant of [sterling]15,000 to that Society.
On 4 January 1955 a memorandum over the hand of T J Hawkins, "Secretary" (possibly of the Department of the Navy) to the Assistant Secretary, Department of the Treasury, referred to the proposal for the formation of a Naval Health Benefits Society.
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of that memorandum were as follows:
 
 Serving personnel are entitled to receive medical, dental and hospital treatment at Departmental expense and are therefore under a disadvantage when joining an outside Health Benefits Society which requires them to pay a contribution which covers themselves as well as their families.
They are also subject to frequent transfers from state to state, shore to sea, and to overseas locations and because of this factor, many are deprived from obtaining the benefits receivable by other members of the community, brought about by their difficulty in maintaining continuity of membership of local societies and also the lack of facilities for becoming a member of such a society when serving in certain posts.
It is therefore thought most desirable that an organisation be provided which will ensure that Naval personnel receive in respect of their dependants the benefits applicable to other members of the community, and at the same time allow him a concession in respect of his own non-insurable status.
The lower deck committee of the R.A.N.
Central Canteen Fund has also considered this matter and has recommended that a substantial grant be made from Canteen Funds to establish the society.


By 15 April 1955, Treasury approval had been received for the formation of a Naval Health Benefits Society.
Implementation of the proposal was approved by the Naval Board on 6 May 1955.
4 The Society was duly formed.
The objects of the Society were --- 
 
 
 (a) to assist members in meeting the cost of 
 
 
 
 
 (i) medical, surgical and therapeutic treatment of and attendance on members and their dependants by legally qualified medical practitioners, and the provision of comforts, appliances and requisites arising out of any such treatment; and 
 (ii) accommodation, maintenance and treatment of members and their dependants as hospital patients; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) to do all such other things as may be considered by the Committee to be necessary or desirable in connexion with all or any of the objects referred to in the last preceding paragraph.

 
 
 

The Society consisted of members, in accordance with the following eligibility provision: 
 
 Any person employed in continuous full-time duty --- 
 
 
 (a) in the Naval Forces, other than a person without dependants, or 
 (b) as a civilian in the Department 
 
 
 shall be eligible to become a member.


When a member died, his widow during her widowhood, his children under the age of 16 or any other person approved by the committee as being wholly dependent upon him at the date of his death, were permitted to continue membership.
The constitution provided for the establishment of a medical benefits fund and a hospital benefits fund.
It provided for the circumstances in which benefits would be paid to members or their dependants.
It set out the contributions which members were required to pay.
It provided for general meetings of members, and for other matters commonly found in the rules of voluntary associations.
If the Society were dissolved, its funds, property and assets remaining after the payment of outstanding claims, debts and liabilities were to be applied "as the Naval Board shall direct".
At its formation and, it appears, throughout its life, the Society was a true association of members.
Its particular feature, of course, was that the contributions which members made as such went into the fund from which benefits were paid in the case of illness or injury.
5 As appears from the provision defining eligibility for membership, a particular feature of the Society was that a member of the naval forces without dependants was not eligible.
This was consistent with one of the originating purposes which led to the foundation of the Society, and to which I have referred above, namely, to provide a scheme which would, for an attractive family contribution rate, provide cover only for dependants.
As I have said, serving members of the Navy did not (and still do not) require health insurance for themselves.
Another feature of the Society which should be noted is that civilians employed in the Department of the Navy were also eligible for membership.
Such persons were not provided with medical and hospital benefits as part of their employment, and were, in that respect, in the same position as members of the community having no connection with the Navy.
However, apparently it was thought appropriate to include within the range of persons who would be eligible for membership of the Society the civilian employees of the department.
Accordingly, there was a contribution rate for civilian members without dependants (whereas there was, for the reasons I have explained, no such rate for naval members without dependants).
The family contribution rate for civilian members was higher than the corresponding rate for naval members.
6 The Society apparently operated as intended for many years.
However, in 1972 the Society found itself in circumstances which, according to the evidence, made it "technically insolvent".
As a result, it sought a loan of $30,000 from the RAN Central Canteens Board, and that loan was approved on 27 September 1972.
On 14 June 1973 the loan was renewed, at which time the board also agreed to guarantee the operation of the Society "until it is overtaken by the National Health Scheme in July, 1974.
" It seems that the loan was never repaid, and was effectively forgiven, and treated as a donation.
7 In 2000, substantial changes were effected to the National Health Act 1953 (Cth) ("the NH Act "), under which the applicant was registered.
These changes were introduced by the Health Legislation Amendment Act (No 3) 1999 (Cth) ("the 1999 Act ").
