 
1 I have before me two applications brought by the applicant, Mr Forest, against the respondent.
2 The first application QUD324/2005 was filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 16 June 2005.
The application relates to an incident at the Cairns Base Hospital on 16 November 2004 during which the applicant was refused services at the hospital whilst accompanied by his dog, Knuckles.
The applicant claims that Knuckles is an animal trained to assist the applicant to alleviate the effect of his psychiatric disability within the meaning of Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) ("DD Act") and, in refusing the provision of services to him whilst accompanied by the dog, the respondent acted in breach of the DD Act .
3 The matter was transferred to the Federal Court by order of Coker FM of 31 August 2005.
