 PART 1 --- INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW 
 Introduction 
 
 1 The essential issue which arises in these proceedings is whether the terms of a letter of engagement, under which an investment bank was retained by a large public company to advise on a proposed takeover, excluded the existence of any fiduciary relationship between the investment bank and its client.
2 The corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC') contends that, notwithstanding the existence of a clause in the letter which excluded the existence of such a relationship, the investment bank breached certain fiduciary duties to its client by failing to obtain the client's informed consent to proprietary trading in the takeover target's shares by another division of the bank.
ASIC also contends that the purchase, and subsequent sale, of a portion of the parcel of the target's shares, constituted insider trading.

 Abbreviations, Acronyms etc 
 
 3 Toll Holdings Limited ('Toll') is the parent company of a number of corporations in the Toll corporate group, including Toll (Corporate Services) Pty Limited ('Toll Corporate').
I do not propose to distinguish between the various members of the Toll group, except where necessary.
Accordingly, I will describe Toll and its related bodies corporate by the abbreviation 'Toll', unless the context otherwise requires.
4 I will set out a list of acronyms as Schedule I to my reasons for judgment.
Schedule II will contain a dramatis personae.

 Overview 
 
 5 Citigroup Inc is a global financial services company which conducts its business in more than 100 countries.
It operates in Australia primarily through Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Limited ('Citigroup') which is the defendant in these proceedings.
6 Citigroup's activities are conducted through various businesses including the Corporate and Investment Bank, known by the acronym 'CIB'.
The CIB provides a diverse range of products and services.
They include investment banking and financial products and services to wholesale investors, financial advisory services and equities trading.
The CIB conducts equities trading on its own account, as principal, as well as for institutional or wholesale customers.
7 The CIB is divided into a number of operational areas and divisions.
Employees who work in some of these areas are likely to be exposed to "inside information" within the meaning of s 1042A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
A prime example is the Investment Banking Division, known by the acronym, 'IBD', which provides financial advisory and investment banking services including in relation to mergers and acquisitions.
8 Employees in other areas, such as Equities (other than Equity Capital Markets, or 'ECM'), are not expected to come into possession of such information.
Those employees work on the public side of Citigroup's business and are known as 'public side' employees.
Employees who work in areas which are exposed to information that may amount to inside information are called 'private side' employees.
9 Citigroup has established Chinese walls between employees who work in the private side and the public side of its business.
It is apparently now more common to describe these structures by the anodyne term "information barriers": see Asia Pacific Telecommunications Limited v Optus Networks Pty Limited [2007] NSWSC 350 at [4] .
I prefer the traditional description, Chinese walls.
10 The issues which arise in the present proceedings raise, at least in part, the question of whether Citigroup's Chinese walls were adequate to prevent the flow of inside information from the private side to the public side.
11 The proceedings arise out of the purchase by a public side employee of over one million shares in Patrick Corporation Limited ('Patrick') at a time when private side employees working in the IBD were acting for Citigroup's client, Toll, on a proposed takeover bid for Patrick.
The shares were purchased by a trader, Mr Andrew Manchee, who worked on the proprietary trading desk which is situated in Equity Derivatives, within the Equities Division.
12 ASIC does not suggest that Mr Manchee was in possession of inside information when he purchased the shares.
However, when Mr Manchee's purchases became known to private side employees, steps were taken to instruct him to stop buying further shares in Patrick.
Mr Manchee followed the letter of the instruction but not long after receiving it he sold nearly 200,000 of the parcel he had previously purchased.
13 ASIC relies on the steps which were taken within Citigroup once Mr Manchee's purchases became known to the private side as demonstrating the inadequacy of the Chinese walls to prevent the flow of inside information from the private side to the public side.
ASIC also contends that the sale by Mr Manchee of 192,352 Patrick shares after a conversation with his superior, Mr Paul Darwell, constituted insider trading by Citigroup in contravention of s 1043A of the Corporations Act .
14 But the more fundamental point for which ASIC contends is that Citigroup, as an adviser to Toll on its proposed takeover of Patrick, occupied a relationship which was, in critical respects, fiduciary.
ASIC contends that as a fiduciary, Citigroup was obliged not to allow itself to be placed in a position of actual or potential conflict between its duty of loyalty to Toll and its interest in the profits sought to be obtained from its proprietary trading in Patrick shares.
15 ASIC submits that the fundamental point to be made in these proceedings is that if trading by an institution such as Citigroup in the shares of its client's target company is to be undertaken, the institution needs to obtain the informed consent of the client.
It is not sufficient, according to ASIC, for consent to be given indirectly.
What is said to be required is the client's express permission for trading.
16 A difficulty immediately arises in ASIC's argument in the present case.
This is because ASIC contends that the fiduciary relationship between Citigroup and Toll arose from the contract between them.
But the mandate letter, under which Toll's wholly owned subsidiary, Toll Corporate, engaged Citigroup as its adviser for the proposed takeover bid provided expressly that Citigroup was engaged:
 "as an independent contractor and not in any other capacity including as a fiduciary".

 17 In Hospital Products Limited v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64 ; (1984) 156 CLR 41 at 97, Mason J said that where a contractual relationship provides the foundation for the erection of a fiduciary relationship, the contract regulates the rights and liabilities of the parties.
His Honour went on to say that the fiduciary relationship, "if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to", the contractual terms.
18 How then, to use the language of Mason J in Hospital Products , can a fiduciary relationship be superimposed upon the mandate letter in the face of clear language which excludes it?
19 ASIC's answer to this conundrum is to be found in eleven propositions to which I will refer later.
At the heart of them is the proposition that where the inclusion of a particular term in a contract between a fiduciary and client would create an actual or potential conflict of interest between the fiduciary and the client, the fiduciary must obtain the client's informed consent to the inclusion of that provision.
This approach to the question builds, in large measure, analogically upon principles applicable to solicitors: see in particular the observations of Mahoney JA in Law Society of New South Wales v Foreman (1994) 34 NSWLR 408 at 435-436.
20 The gravamen of ASIC's case is that for the exclusion of the fiduciary relationship in the mandate letter to be effective, it was incumbent upon Citigroup to draw Toll's attention expressly to the effect of the exclusion, that is, that it permitted Citigroup to trade in Patrick shares on its own account, in potential conflict with the interests of Toll.
21 Citigroup disputes the applicability of ten of the eleven propositions propounded by ASIC.
It submits that because the mandate letter provides so precisely that no fiduciary relationship exists between Citigroup and Toll, there is simply no scope for the mandate to accommodate a fiduciary relationship.
It submits that the propositions put forward by ASIC to overcome this difficulty have no application particularly when the fiduciary relationship is not one of the 'per se' relationships referred to in the authorities: see for example Hospital Products at 96 per Mason J.
22 The substance of Citigroup's answer to the claim is that the duty of a fiduciary to obtain the informed consent of a client has no application here because it presupposes the existence of an antecedent fiduciary relationship.
No such pre-existing relation is claimed to have been created.
23 Citigroup also relies, to the extent necessary, upon events preceding (and post-dating) the execution of the mandate letter, as demonstrating Toll's knowledge of, and informed consent to, Citigroup's proprietary trading in Patrick shares.
These events include the submission by Citigroup to one of the Toll companies, Toll Transport Pty Limited ('Toll Transport'), and subsequent execution, of a Custodian  Nominee Appointment Agreement dated 23 June 2005.
That contract deals with the acquisition by Citigroup of a discreet pre-bid stake in Patrick for and on behalf of Toll.
This contract contained express disclosure of Citigroup's right to trade as principal in Patrick shares.
24 ASIC also points to events pre-dating the execution of the mandate letter as part of its case.
However, a difficulty arises because of its disavowal of any fiduciary relationship pre-dating the actual execution of the mandate letter: cf United Dominions Corporation Limited v Brian Pty Limited [1985] HCA 49 ; (1985) 157 CLR 1 at 11-12 per Mason, Brennan and Deane JJ.
25 A central part of ASIC's case is that Citigroup was required, as a financial services licensee, to have in place adequate arrangements for the management of conflicts of interest: see s 912A(1)(aa) of the Corporations Act .
According to ASIC, conducting proprietary trading without having obtained Toll's informed consent to the proprietary trading, amounts to a breach of this subsection.
26 ASIC does not concede that, as a matter of statutory construction, s 912A(1)(aa) applies only where a licensee and its client are in a fiduciary relationship.
However, Mr Walker SC, for ASIC, did concede that for the purposes of the present case, ASIC's contention that Citigroup contravened s 912A(1)(aa) depends upon the success of ASIC's submission that the parties were in a fiduciary relationship.
27 Even if Citigroup did owe fiduciary duties to Toll, the question of whether s 912A(1)(aa) was engaged depends upon a number of questions of statutory construction.
The principal questions are whether Citigroup was providing "financial services" within the meaning of s 766A(1) and "financial product advice' within the meaning of s 766B(1) of the Corporations Act , as well as whether any such services were exempt services within Reg 7.1.29(3) of the Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth).
28 ASIC seeks to argue the conflicts claim on three further bases.
These are, first, a contravention of s 1041H of the Corporations Act , second, breach of s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) and third, breach of s 12CA of the ASIC Act .
However, each of them depends upon acceptance of ASIC's contention that Citigroup owed fiduciary duties to Toll.
29 There are two separate insider trading claims against Citigroup.
The first is Mr Manchee's sale of the 192,352 shares in Patrick.
Mr Manchee was a public side employee.
He was not told that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the proposed takeover of Patrick.
Nevertheless, he is alleged to have made that supposition as a result of an instruction from Mr Darwell.
30 Thus, a question which arises in the first insider trading claim is whether an uncommunicated supposition, formed as a result of a person's internal thought processes, amounts to "information" within the meaning of s 1042A of the Corporations Act .
However, there is a threshold question as to whether Mr Manchee was an "officer" of Citigroup whose knowledge is to be attributed to that corporation.
31 The second insider trading claim is that certain private side employees of Citigroup were aware that Citigroup was acting for Toll on the proposed takeover and that there was a substantial likelihood that Toll would announce its bid in the very near future.
The purchase and sale by Citigroup of Patrick shares while those employees were in possession of the information is said to constitute insider trading.
32 Issues arise as to whether the information was "generally available" and whether a reasonable person would expect it to have a "material effect" on the price of Patrick shares: see s 1042A of the Corporations Act .
33 A central issue which arises on the second insider trading case is whether Citigroup has made good its defence that it had in place adequate Chinese walls in accordance with the statutory defence contained in s 1043F of the Corporations Act .

 PART II --- THE FACTS 
 Private Side Employees Learn of Public Side Purchases 
 
 34 On 8 August 2005, Toll engaged Citigroup, through the IBD, to act as Toll's joint adviser on a proposed takeover of Patrick.
The terms of the retainer were recorded in the mandate letter to which I referred briefly at [16].
35 I will set out the terms of the retainer in more detail later.
It is sufficient to record by way of introduction that Citigroup undertook to perform such "financial advisory and investment banking services" for Toll as were customary and appropriate in a proposed takeover bid.
36 Although the mandate letter was not signed until 8 August 2005, the IBD had been 'pitching' to Toll from at least January 2005 in an effort to secure the mandate.
37 The head of the team of Citigroup employees who led the pitch was Mr Grant Dempsey.
He was Co-Head, Melbourne Coverage, Investment Banking.
All of the employees who worked for Mr Dempsey were private side employees who were members of the IBD.
38 Mr Dempsey's team was not the only team on the private side of the Chinese wall who worked for Toll on the takeover.
The ECM Division of Citigroup was retained by Toll in January 2005 to acquire, on a confidential basis, a shareholding in Patrick of up to 4.9% on behalf of Toll.
39 Mr Mark Bartels was the head of the ECM Division.
His team commenced purchasing Patrick shares on 19 January 2005.
The purchases continued until 26 July 2005.
40 Mr Bartels' team was separate from Mr Dempsey's team.
The primary function of ECM was to provide advice on structuring, marketing and pricing of equity and equity-linked securities offers for capital raising transactions.
In the context of the Toll takeover, however, Mr Bartel's team provided share market summaries to both Toll and to Mr Dempsey's team.
41 On 19 August 2005, the market was alive with rumours that Toll would make a bid for Patrick.
That morning, between about 10:15am and about 11:50am, Mr Manchee purchased approximately 450,000 shares in Patrick.
He then adopted a particularly aggressive buying approach in the afternoon acquiring 674,752 shares in Patrick, on Citigroup's account, between 2:55pm and 3:07pm.
42 At some time during the course of the day, Mr Bartels noticed that Citigroup had engaged in extensive trading in Patrick shares.
During the afternoon Mr Bartels made two significant calls.
One was to Mr Malcolm Sinclair, Citigroup's Head of Equities.
The other was to Mr Peter Monaci, Managing Director, Head of Capital Markets and Global Banking Compliance for the Asia Pacific region of CIB.
43 Mr Sinclair and Mr Monaci are both private side employees.
However, the contact between Mr Bartels and Mr Sinclair resulted in a conversation between Mr Sinclair and an employee on the public side of the Chinese wall.
That employee was Mr Darwell, the Head of Equity Derivatives, who was as I mentioned above, Mr Manchee's superior.
What took place between Mr Sinclair and Mr Darwell, and in a subsequent conversation between Mr Darwell and Mr Manchee, is at the heart of the first insider trading case.
44 Mr Bartels' conversations with Mr Sinclair and Mr Monaci also resulted in knowledge of Citigroup's stake in Patrick radiating through various parts of the private side of the Chinese wall.
Discussions took place between Mr Sinclair, Mr Monaci, Mr Stephen Roberts, the CEO of CIB (Australia and New Zealand), and Mr Warren Scott, Citigroup's General Counsel (Australia and New Zealand).
Those four persons then contacted Mr Bartels to seek his opinion as to whether Toll should be informed of Citigroup's trading.
45 The conversations between those gentlemen on the private side of the Chinese wall, as well as those which took place across the Chinese wall between Mr Sinclair and Mr Darwell and then between Mr Darwell and Mr Manchee are said to show that Citigroup had no adequate mechanism or procedures to manage a conflict.
46 What is noticeable about the discussions that took place on the afternoon and early evening of 19 August 2005 is that Mr Dempsey was not informed that Citigroup had acquired a stake in Patrick.

 Mr Bartels' Conversations with Mr Sinclair and Mr Sinclair's with Mr Darwell 
 
 47 The evidence suggests that Mr Bartels called Mr Sinclair before he alerted Mr Monaci, although the exact sequence of the calls is not entirely clear from the evidence.
In my view, it is more likely that Mr Sinclair was Mr Bartels' first port of call because there was no suggestion that Mr Monaci was aware of the trading when he first spoke to Mr Sinclair.
48 Mr Sinclair's Equities Division is on the public side of the Chinese wall but Mr Sinclair sits on the private side.
At some time during lunch or in the early afternoon of 19 August 2005 Mr Bartels told Mr Sinclair that Citigroup was trading in Patrick shares.
There appear to have been two telephone conversations between Mr Bartels and Mr Sinclair about that fact.
49 Mr Sinclair was sufficiently concerned about the situation that he contacted Mr Darwell, a public side employee.
Equity Derivatives, of which Mr Darwell is Head, is a subdivision of Equities.
Mr Darwell reports to Mr Sinclair.
50 The conversation between Mr Sinclair and Mr Darwell took place shortly after 3pm.
Mr Sinclair asked Mr Darwell whether Citigroup was involved in trading in Patrick shares and who was doing the buying.
Mr Darwell made some enquiries and reported back to Mr Sinclair that the proprietary trading team was involved.
He said that Mr Manchee had purchased the shares.
51 In one of the conversations between Mr Sinclair and Mr Darwell, most likely before Mr Darwell spoke to Mr Manchee, Mr Sinclair said to Mr Darwell "we may have a problem".
52 Mr Darwell did not ask Mr Sinclair why there might be a problem.
He thought in his own mind that there may be some truth in the rumours of a takeover bid for Patrick and that Citigroup may be involved.
But he made no enquiry of Mr Sinclair because he was unaware of the takeover and:
 "I would not ask because it may put me in a position where I would cease to function in my job".

 The 'Cigarette on the Pavement' Conversation 
 
 53 Mr Darwell's Equity Derivatives area is organised into trading desks, one of which is the proprietary trading desk at which Mr Manchee sits.
He is one of five traders at that desk and reports to Mr Darwell.
Mr Manchee is, of course, a public side employee.
54 Mr Manchee has a daily trading limit of AUD$10 million in leading stocks, that is to say, those within the ASX 200.
He can purchase up to AUD$10 million worth of any one stock.
The limit is an end-of-day limit, so that he is apparently authorised to spend more than AUD$10 million during the day, provided that his book is within the limit at the close of trading.
The purchase of approximately one million shares in Patrick at a price of just over AUD$6 was well within Mr Manchee's limit.
55 After Mr Sinclair's enquiry of Mr Darwell, Mr Darwell phoned Mr Manchee.
The phone call took place between about 3:15 and 3:30pm.
The call was short.
Mr Darwell said "Can we go down for a cigarette?
" This was enough for Mr Manchee to realise that Mr Darwell wanted to discuss something.
56 A conversation then took place on the pavement outside of Citigroup's offices.
Mr Darwell asked Mr Manchee how many shares he had purchased and why he had bought them.
He asked why Mr Manchee was being so aggressive.
Mr Manchee had bought approximately 1.2 million shares and told Mr Darwell that he had bought them because of hedge fund trading, charts, volume and rumours.
Mr Darwell said "Don't buy any more".

 Mr Manchee's Thought Processes 
 
 57 Mr Manchee accepted that the conversation with Mr Darwell was unusual.
He agreed that this applied to the circumstances and the subject matter, including the fact that Mr Darwell gave no reason for the instruction not to buy any more shares.
Mr Manchee took Mr Darwell to mean that he was carrying too much risk; that was one of the reasons he sold nearly 200,000 shares when he returned to his desk.
58 Mr Manchee gave the following evidence in his examination under s 19 of the ASIC Act on 12 December 2005: 
 
 
 "Q Didn't it occur to you that Darwell's reason for giving you this instruction was a matter that he felt unable to communicate with you?

 A Privilege.
I suppose there was a possibility that he was unable to communicate something to me.

 Q Didn't you suppose that when he was telling you to stop buying it had something to do with these rumours about a Toll takeover?

 A Privilege.
I probably assumed it did.
" 
 
 
 59 The examination continued as follows: 
 
 
 "Q I am trying to explore what your state of mind was at the time.
Didn't it occur to you that Darwell knew something that he couldn't tell you, but which was in his view a good reason why he should tell you to stop buying Patrick shares?

 A Privilege.
That might have been one of the things that I thought about.

 Q Didn't it occur to you that a possibility was that he knew something about Citigroup's involvement with the rumoured Toll takeover and that's why he was speaking to you?

 A Privilege.
As I said, perhaps there was a possibility he did know something I didn't know.

 Q What I was wanting to explore was, do you agree that that was something that occurred to you at the time as a possibility?

 A Privilege.
I can't recall exactly, but it probably, it could have occurred to me at the time that, you know, it was a possibility.

 Q Well, isn't this right, that you supposed at the time that one possibility was that the reason Darwell was telling you to stop buying Patrick shares was because he knew something that he couldn't tell you about the Citigroup's involvement in the rumoured Toll takeover.

 A Privilege.
Perhaps at the time I thought he might have known something that he couldn't tell me, and the reason that he would know something but couldn't tell me that Citigroup were involved somehow, perhaps he would have known, and I might have thought about that as a possibility.
" 
 
 
 60 Later in the examination the following exchange took place: 
 
 
 "Q But wasn't it obvious to you that the reason that Darwell was telling you to stop buying shares was because he knew something about Citigroup's involvement that he couldn't tell you that was the reason you should keep out of it?

 A Privilege.
No.
I didn't know that was --- I wouldn't have even thought, even if Citigroup did have something to do with it, that he would know anything.
" 
 
 
 61 It will be seen that in the earlier part of the examination, Mr Manchee made a concession which, on one view, he later withdrew.
Mr Myers QC for Citigroup did not concede that there was an inconsistency between the two portions of the transcript but he consented to leave being granted to Mr Walker to cross-examine Mr Manchee on the apparent inconsistency in accordance with s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).
I will deal with this later in my reasons for judgment.

 The Compliance Department is Notified 
 
 62 Sometime prior to 4pm, Mr Sinclair and Mr Monaci had a conversation in Mr Sinclair's office.
The conversation was to the following effect: 
 
 "Mr Sinclair: It's the prop desk who have traded.

 Mr Monaci: What do you mean?

 Mr Sinclair: The prop traders have been trading in Patricks.

 ... 
 Mr Monaci: Just because the prop desk has traded in Patrick doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem with the Chinese wall.
We shouldn't automatically assume that there's something wrong.
We will probably get a regulatory inquiry given the volume of trading in Patrick that has occurred.

 Mr Sinclair: I agree.
I asked Paul Darwell to look into the trading.
Let me call Paul in.

 Mr Monaci: Wait, hang on, Paul is public side.

 Mr Sinclair: I understand that.
We'll tell him that we've got a query.
" 
 
 63 Mr Monaci wanted to ensure that he did not tip off Mr Darwell or "taint him".
He therefore said to Mr Sinclair:
 "Okay.
We'll tell him that we picked it up on surveillance and that given the increase in the price of the stock, we're expecting a query from the stock exchange.
" 
 64 At some stage during the afternoon of 19 August 2005, most probably after his conversations with Mr Sinclair, and after Mr Sinclair had first spoken with Mr Monaci, Mr Bartels rang Mr Monaci.
He also told him that Citigroup had purchased a large parcel of Patrick shares.
He said that Mr Monaci could expect an enquiry from ASIC.

 Citigroup's General Counsel and CEO Are Informed 
 
 65 At some time after his conversation with Mr Sinclair, Mr Monaci went to see another private side employee, Mr Scott.
It is not clear whether Mr Sinclair was present though the evidence seems to indicate it was likely he was there.
66 Mr Monaci told Mr Scott that Toll's bid was expected to be announced on Monday and that Citigroup's proprietary trading desk had engaged in substantial trading during the day.
67 Messrs Monaci and Scott then went to a conference room on level 40 of Citigroup's premises where Mr Roberts was present with Mr Les Matheson, Country Officer for Citigroup in Australia.
Mr Matheson was responsible for all aspects of Citigroup's retail business.
He left shortly after Mr Monaci and Mr Scott arrived.
Mr Sinclair also seems to have been present during the discussions that took place.
68 A discussion took place between Messrs Roberts, Sinclair, Scott and Monaci.
The fact that Citigroup had engaged in proprietary trading, with the purchase of about one million shares in Patrick, was revealed to Mr Roberts.
69 Mr Monaci expressed concern to Mr Roberts and the others that there may be a perception within ASIC of potential insider trading by Citigroup.
Mr Monaci seems to have expressed the view that there was no breach in the Chinese wall.
70 One of the persons present at the meeting asked "Should we tell Toll?".
Mr Roberts appears to have said that Mr Bartels was the appropriate person to answer that question.

 The CEO and Others Telephone Mr Bartels 
 
 71 In the early evening of 19 August 2005, at about 6pm or 7pm, those present at the meeting with Mr Roberts called Mr Bartels on a speaker phone.
One of them asked Mr Bartels whether they should tell Toll that Citigroup had purchased shares in Patrick.
72 Mr Bartels expressed the view that it was unnecessary for Citigroup to inform Toll.

 A CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT OF THE RELEVANT FACTS 
 December 2004 to January 2005: Citigroup Begins Pitching to Toll 
 
 73 By late December 2004, Citigroup's IBD began preparing documents for the purpose of an approach to Toll.
Citigroup sought to be retained by Toll as its adviser in relation to opportunities to enter the Ports logistics market in Australia.
74 A discussion paper prepared by Citigroup, dated 31 December 2004, identified Patrick as "the most immediate and realistic entry opportunity" for Toll.
It stated that Toll was uniquely positioned to acquire Patrick.
It also stated that Citigroup would be pleased to work with Toll to refine its analysis of the acquisition and to agree on a final recommendation.
75 Even before this discussion paper, Citigroup was well aware of the need to identify and deal with potential conflicts of interest in transactions generally.
In a memorandum dated 29 November 2004 to CIB Division Heads and various managers, including Compliance Managers, a directive was given about proceeding with transactions that may involve, inter alia , the likelihood of a conflict.
76 The memorandum included a directive that if business management wished to proceed with such a transaction, the Division Head:
 "must determine if the transaction could reasonably be expected to cause clients or regulators to express concern as to whether the transaction is consistent with the behaviour they would expect of a leading market participant and, as a result, our reputation and standing could be damaged".

 77 Indeed, in another transaction between Citigroup and Toll recorded in a mandate letter dated 10 December 2004, Mr Dempsey and Mr Bartels provided expressly for Citigroup to be entitled to purchase shares on its own account.
The letter stated:
 "The Company hereby agrees that Citigroup and/or a related body corporate thereof will, subject to adherence with the Corporations Act and any other relevant laws, above confidentiality obligations and the effective operation of appropriate 'Chinese Walls' within by [sic] Citigroup, have the right to purchase shares for their own account and that any such purchase will not constitute a conflict of interest for purposes of Citigroup's engagement hereunder.
" 
 January 2005 to February 2005: The Pitch Continues; Citigroup Purchases Shares Discreetly for Toll 
 
 78 On 12 January 2005, Mr Dempsey sent an email to Mr Neil Chatfield, the Chief Financial Officer of Toll, setting out a number of possible alternative methods for the acquisition of Patrick.
One of them was a takeover offer to Patrick shareholders consisting partly of cash and partly of scrip.
The scrip was to comprise partly shares in Toll and partly shares in Patrick' s 62.4% owned subsidiary, Virgin Blue Holdings Limited ("Virgin").
79 On 19 January 2005, Mr Chatfield instructed Mr Bartels to acquire a stake in Patrick of up to 4.9%.
The shares were to be acquired discreetly in the name of a Citigroup company as nominee.
Acquisitions commenced that same day.
80 On 20 January 2005, Mr Christian Lunny of Citigroup's IBD sent an email to Mr Dempsey, Mr Bartels and others within Citigroup.
The email sought to check possible conflicts of interest so as to ensure it was appropriate "to continue pitching" the transaction to Toll.
The email went on to describe Citigroup's role as being "to act as financial adviser to Toll for the 100% acquisition of Patrick".
It also stated that Citigroup would seek to provide Toll with its acquisition financing requirements.
81 On 21 January 2005, Citigroup's IBD prepared an updated analysis for the proposed acquisition of Patrick.
Codenames were given to the project, the bidder and the target.
The project was known as "Douro", the bidder as "Tawny" and the target as "Para".
82 The updated analysis document stated that Citigroup believed the best method of achieving Tawny's strategic objectives was to acquire 100% of Para with the consideration to comprise cash and scrip in Virgin.
The document also stated that:
 "Citigroup would be pleased to work with Tawny to refine the acquisition analysis and to agree on the most appropriate transaction structure.
" 
 83 On 24 January 2005, Mr Dempsey sent an email to Mr Chatfield and Mr Stephen Stanley of Toll.
The email thanked them for their time at a meeting on 21 January 2005.
Mr Dempsey suggested a meeting take place with Citigroup's head of mergers and acquisitions to discuss the takeover process.
Mr Dempsey also stated:
 "Now that we are fully aware of the history, we can really get some good advise [sic] back to you in terms of options next meeting.
" 
 84 On 31 January 2005, Citigroup prepared a further draft working document for Project Douro.
The document stated that it was agreed at the last meeting between Tawny and Citigroup that their analyses of the potential acquisition of Para were "well aligned" and the focus should shift to the question of acquisition approach and funding issues.
85 The document also stated that:
 "Tawny should consider formally engaging Citigroup to further develop an acquisition financing plan, encompassing all capital markets (debt, hybrid and equity).
" 
 86 The document also made reference to the fact that Tawny had commenced discreet purchases of shares in Para in an effort to move to the substantial shareholder threshold of 4.9%.
An estimate of the time required to accumulate that stake was given at up to four months.
87 On 2 February 2005, Mr Dempsey sent an email to Mr Chatfield setting out some thoughts for further discussion.
The email included the following:
 "So, my pitch is to get mandated (of course!
) And get our guys internally to the line on funding approval ..." 
 88 On 3 February 2005, Mr Dempsey sent an email to an officer of Citigroup Inc in the USA.
He said that Citigroup had targeted Toll strongly and that "we are 'near mandated'".
89 On 7 February 2005, Mr Dempsey sent another email to Mr Chatfield.
Mr Dempsey suggested a further meeting to chat about Project Douro and to discuss Citigroup being given a mandate.
90 On 8 February 2005, Citigroup prepared a draft working document dealing with the next steps in Project Douro.
It said that those steps should be to "focus on key funding strategy and execution issues" to prepare for a bid.
91 Citigroup prepared a further working document on 18 February 2005 for a presentation to Tawny.
The stated objective of the document was to "re-assess the economics to Tawny for the acquisition of Para".
Core assumptions of the analysis included an offer premium range of 25% to 35% over the prevailing Patrick share price.
92 The document of 18 February 2005 contained a number of projections on the impact of the takeover including the impact on Tawny's earnings per share after the acquisition of Para.

 March 2005 to April 2005: Citigroup Reports on Share Purchases and Continues Pitching 
 
 93 On 24 March 2005, Mr Bartels sent an email to Mr Chatfield reporting on Citigroup's purchase of shares in Patrick for Toll Holdings.
He said that the purchases had been very discreet and that Citigroup's purchases since 19 January 2005 had been at a price which was lower than the Volume Weighted Average Price ('VWAP') on the active days.
94 Mr Bartels sent a further email to Mr Chatfield on 20 April 2005 stating that Citigroup had beaten the VWAP on all the days it had been active.
95 On 22 April 2005, Mr Dempsey sent an email to Mr Chatfield, with a copy to Mr Paul Little, the CEO of Toll.
The email attached an updated analysis of the proposed takeover based on the latest research reports on Tawny, Para and "Vintage".
Vintage was the code name for Virgin.
The document included a sensitivity analysis of the effect on Tawny's earnings per share based on a range of different premiums over the Patrick share price.

 May 2005: Citigroup Still Not Appointed 
 
 96 By May 2005 Citigroup had still not received the mandate it sought.
On 3 May 2005, Mr Dempsey sent an email to Mr Chatfield stating that he had spoken to Mr Little who was in New Zealand.
He reported that Mr Little had said that Citigroup should not assume it would advise Toll on the takeover and "there were others interested in doing so".
Mr Dempsey commented that he had assumed that Citigroup was "working somewhat in the tent despite not being mandated".
97 On 13 May 2005, Mr Dempsey sent an email to Mr Stanley of Toll.
The email attached an analysis showing the projected premium on Patrick's share price based on the VWAP over various periods.
98 Mr Dempsey sent another email to Mr Chatfield on 18 May 2005 pitching yet again for the mandate and attaching a confidential letter to this effect from himself and Jason McLeod, also Co-Head of IBD Coverage, Melbourne.
It is apparent from the email and letter that by this date, another company, Carnegie Wylie  Company Pty Limited ('Carnegie Wylie'), had been named by Toll as a possible adviser.
99 The email of 18 May 2005 included the following:
 "The only thing we will continue to emphasis [sic] as we work the scope out is our ability to add significant value on the advisory side of the business as well.
As the letter says, we respect the capabilities in this area of Toll and the position Wylie has but we also think we have exhibited our strong capabilities in this area.
We continue to have very good global market news which is invaluable in these processes.
We not only have access to global players (as you now have) we have strong understanding of their transaction history which again is invaluable in interpreting interactions with them.

 There is also an enormous amount of work in a public takeover and most of that grunt will be done by our team.
So, just a little pitch for us to continue to be seen as not just a funder but also adviser.
To that end, participating in as many meetings as possible relating to the transaction is important to be able to maxim [sic] our value.
At the end of the day this is a large transaction with room for many points of view.
One that Citigroup will back to the hilt even if it gets a little hairy.
" 
 100 The confidential letter attached to the email pointed out to Mr Chatfield the advantages to Toll of the appointment of Citigroup as its adviser.
101 Mr Dempsey and Mr McLeod stated in the letter that they supported the possible role for Mr John Wylie of Carnegie Wylie.
They also said they would "work with you to ensure a working relationship to the benefit of Toll".
102 The letter of 18 May 2005 continued as follows:
 "We also appreciate the in-house capabilities Toll has in merger  acquisitions and look forward to defining the scope parties may play in this transaction and to demonstrate the value Citigroup will deliver in a broad advisory leadership role.

 We strongly believe Citigroup's ability to bring a complete advisory and funding package (equity  debt) will be crucial to the success of the proposed transaction.
Driving the advisory effort is important to us and we believe we will add as much in that area as we will in funding support.
In particular, we trust that Citigroup has already demonstrated some of the key requirements needed as financial adviser.
" 
 June 2005: Citigroup Requires Execution of Custodian  Nominee Appointment 
 
 103 Although Citigroup had commenced purchasing a stake in Patrick on Toll's behalf in January 2005, no formal documentation was prepared until mid-June of that year.
104 On 15 June 2005, Mr Bartels sent an email to Mr Chatfield stating that, as previously discussed, Citigroup had purchased shares in the name of Citigroup nominees and another nominee company.
He forwarded a form of Custodian  Nominee Appointment for execution by Toll.
105 The form of Custodian  Nominee Appointment provided for Toll Transport to appoint Citigroup (or its authorised representative) as its custodian and nominee for the financial products designated by it.
106 The proposed terms of the Custodian  Nominee Appointment incorporated certain standard Citigroup Terms of Business.
