 
1 I have before me a notice of motion filed by Mr Ian Delaney on 13 February 2007.
Mr Delaney's notice of motion sought the following orders:
 
 
 1.
That Ian Delaney be joined as a party to the Native Title Determination Application --- QUD355/2006 Noonukul of Minjerrabah.
2.
That the Native Title Determination Application --- QUD355/2006 Noonukul of Minjerrabah be struck out.
3.
Such further or other orders as the Court considers fit.

 

2 Mr Delaney is the Registered Native Title Applicant for the Quandamooka Peoples #1, QUD6010/1998 and Quandamooka Peoples #2, QUD6024/1999 Native Title Determination Applications (Quandamooka Claims).
These claims were accepted for registration on 11 October 2000 and 14 June 2000 respectively.
BACKGROUND 
 
3 The Native Title Determination Application --- QUD355/2006 Noonukul of Minjerrabah (Noonukul Application) was filed 8 September 2006.
However, it substantially overlaps the Quandamooka Claims and was rejected for registration by a delegate of the Native Title Registrar on 9 January 2007.
4 Queensland South Native Titles Services ("QSNTS") for Mr Delaney submits that prosecution of Mr Delaney's notice of motion relates to concerns by the Quandamooka Claim group that the Noonukul Application would impede progress towards a consent determination, due to the policy of the State of Queensland not to engage in mediation when overlapping claims exist.
5 This matter was listed for directions before me on 9 March 2007.
At that hearing there was no appearance by the applicant, however I granted leave to Mr Robert Corowa to appear for the applicant.
I made the following orders:
 
 
 1.
Ian Delaney be joined as a respondent in the proceedings pursuant to s 84(5) Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).
2.
The notice of motion filed 13 February 2007 to be heard at 10.15 am on 28 May 2007.
3.
The respondent to the notice of motion to file and serve any material upon which it intended to rely by 30 March 2007.
4.
The applicant to the notice of motion to file and serve an outline of argument by 13 April 2007.
5.
The respondent to the notice of motion to file and serve an outline of argument in response by 4 May 2007.
6.
Notification of witnesses required for cross-examination by any party to be served upon the other party and filed by 14 May 2007.

 
 NON-APPEARANCE OF THE APPLICANT 
 
6 At the hearing of the notice of motion on 28 May 2007, there was no appearance in Court by Mr Walker, the applicant in the substantive proceedings (to whom I shall refer in this judgment as "the applicant").
Further, it is apparent from the file that the applicant did not comply with my orders of 9 March 2007 in relation to the filing of material for the hearing of this notice of motion.
I note that QSNTS filed an outline of submissions on 13 April 2007.
