 OUTLINE OF ISSUES 
 
1 In mid 1999 three businessmen, John Bax, Fred Gulson and John Reece, through their shareholdings in and directorships of BGR Corporation Pty Ltd, gained control of the Main Star One group of companies.
That group was involved in the production, distribution and sale of tea tree oil and its products.
Initially Mr Gulson's company, The Triad Health Products Group of Companies Pty Ltd, held 70.4% of the shares in BGR, Mr Bax's company, The Food Improvers Pty Ltd held 22.2% and Mr Reece's company, Karcor Holdings Pty Ltd, held 7.4%.
Sometime shortly after the beginning of July 1999, Mr Gulson caused Triad to transfer 7.4% of the shares in BGR to Cordato Partners (Services) Pty Limited, a company controlled by his law school friend and a solicitor, Mr Tony Cordato.
2 Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece carried out the functions of the senior management of the businesses, which were known as Main Camp, after the takeover.
They did so in accordance with a business plan which Mr Bax prepared.
Mr Cordato provided the business with legal services, but did not play a role as a director or executive.
In July 1999 each of Triad, Food Improvers and Karcor entered into consultancy agreements, which Mr Cordato had drafted, with a Main Camp company.
In July 2000 replacement consultancy agreements were made with BGR.
All the consultancy agreements provided for the payment to each consultant company of $20,833.33 per month for, inter alia, the provision of services by its respective principal.
3 In March 2001 the consultancy fees ceased to be paid.
There is a substantial issue as to the terms on which that occurred.
Mr Bax and Mr Reece say that invoicing of the fees was suspended but that in the future invoices could be rendered and payments would be made for services provided if and when the Main Camp group could afford to pay.
Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato say that there was no arrangement deferring rendering, or for the payment of, consultancy fees if they had not been invoiced contemporaneously with the provision of the services.
Later, after a dispute in 2002, Mr Reece relinquished his shareholding.
The holdings of the remaining three shareholders from then on were Triad 68%, Food Improvers 24% and Cordato 8% of the shares in BGR.
4 After Mr Reece's departure, Jim Gobert, an expert in the use of and applications of tea tree oil products, took up the role of marketing manager of the group as an employee, but not as a shareholder or partner.
5 Eventually in about mid 2003, the payment of consultancy fees recommenced, but at much reduced rates, though there were increases later.
Mr Bax's and Mr Gulson's companies received consultancy fees thereafter.
6 In early 2005 Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Gobert were planning an overseas trip to market tea tree oil.
Mr Gobert was also to have discussions with European regulators about standards that were then being contemplated that would affect the sale of tea tree products within the European Commission.
They arrived in Europe in the latter part of May 2005.
Mr Gulson began to exhibit quite erratic behaviour as a result of a psychiatric condition which he had and which worsened during this time.
7 On 29 May 2005, in circumstances which I will describe in more detail below, Mr Gulson, without any prior discussion with Mr Bax, summarily dismissed Mr Gobert in London for no good reason on the eve of important meetings with an Israeli customer.
Mr Bax then said that he could no longer work with Mr Gulson and refused to do so.
Mr Gulson attended the meetings with the Israeli customer that had been scheduled the next day.
All three men made their way home, Messrs Bax and Gobert travelling together and Mr Gulson separately.
Mr Gulson returned and immediately went to the Main Camp plantation in Northern New South Wales.
His erratic behaviour became more and more pronounced and caused alarm to the plantation manager, Mr Williams, and staff.
8 On 8 June 2005 Mr Gulson met in Sydney with Mr Cordato and Mr Bax.
Mr Gulson was adamant that Mr Gobert would not be reinstated, although Mr Bax had already re-employed him.
Mr Bax said that he would not work with Mr Gulson.
Mr Cordato was at that time trying to hold what was obviously a highly fractious position together as best he could so that the parties could co-operate to effect the sale of the Main Camp undertaking and an orderly dissolution of the business relationship.
However, on 10 June 2005 Mr Gulson caused an extraordinary general meeting of BGR to be called for 1 July 2005.
The business of that meeting was to remove Mr Bax as a director, ratify Mr Gulson's summary dismissal of Mr Gobert, and his termination of Food Improvers' consultancy agreement.
Because Mr Gulson's shareholding was sufficient, the July meeting proceeded to do so with Mr Cordato's support.
In the meantime, Mr Gulson had been admitted to the Northside Clinic psychiatric hospital for treatment for his condition which had by then become quite unstable.
Thereafter, Mr Gulson and Mr Cordato substantively exercised control over the direction of BGR to the exclusion of Mr Bax.
In mid July 2005 Food Improvers and Mr Bax commenced these proceedings.
9 In mid September the 2005 the parties met and agreed to appoint an agent for sale of the Main Camp business.
After the meeting Mr Bax prepared two suggested methods of distribution one of which involved a recognition that Food Improvers was owed $500,000 for consultancy fees and that after payment of this amount, the balance of the net proceeds of sale of the Main Camp plantation and business would be distributed to the shareholders by BGR as a fully franked dividend.
After that distribution the shareholders would repay their loan accounts, which were substantial, and BGR would then make a further fully franked dividend.
This became known as 'option B'.
Correspondence ensued in which Mr Cordato, acting as the solicitor for all of the defendants, confirmed that the distribution would be made in accordance with option B.
10 But once the sale had been completed, without notice to Mr Bax, the distribution was ultimately made simply on the basis of shareholding entitlements without any payment recognizing Mr Bax's claim for consultancy fees.
Earlier, when the Main Camp sale was about to be settled, Mr Cordato's solicitors' firm, Cordato Partners, issued 16 accounts totalling about $135,000 in respect of matters in which his firm had acted since 1999.
Those accounts were paid very promptly from the sale proceeds.
11 The proceedings have been conducted with considerable feeling on all sides.
