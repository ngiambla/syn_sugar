 
1 This proceeding came before me as an application for leave to appeal from a decision of a judge of the Court on appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal'): Druett v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2007] FCA 475.
The appellant appears in person.
At the hearing, counsel for the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (named in the notice of appeal as the Department of Family and Community Services) ('the Department') accepted that leave to appeal was not required.
As an appeal from a decision of a judge of the Court to dismiss an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal, that is the case.
Counsel also accepted that service, which had been effected by service on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, was sufficient.
2 Mr Kunc, who appears for the Department, then foreshadowed a notice of motion seeking summary judgment pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') and, in the alternative, an order that the Department be removed as a party to the proceedings pursuant to s 25(2B)(a) of the Act.
A single judge of the Court has power under those sections to make the orders sought (s 25 ; Zegarac v Dellios [2007] FCA 566 at [12] ; Zambini v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2006] FCA 1773 at [4] ; Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 923).
The notice of motion for summary judgment was filed on 24 May 2007 ('the motion').
3 Mr Druett, the appellant, did not object to the presentation of Mr Kunc's submissions in support of the motion.
Mr Druett had come to Court to argue that he was entitled to leave to appeal, which itself raises the question of the merits of the appeal.
He relied upon his affidavit before the primary judge ('the affidavit').
The material annexed to the affidavit included what appear to be submissions to the Family Court in respect of Mr Druett's divorce and application for child custody and extracts from transcripts of, and judgments in, a number of cases in New South Wales courts.
There are also transcripts of applications for special leave in the High Court.
I heard from Mr Druett in response and shortly from Mr Kunc in reply.
Mr Druett did not seek to make further oral submissions but, in order to give him a further opportunity to consider Mr Kunc's submissions in support of the application for summary judgment and the relevant considerations for the Court, I directed that he file and serve any further written submissions by 7 June 2007.
4 Mr Druett then sent extensive additional material ('the additional material') to my Chambers.
That material included a list of authorities, legislation and written submissions set out in a document titled ' Application for costs '.
Also included was Mr Druett's curriculum vitae, family photographs, scanned cards from his children, documents related to his former employment, medical records and an audio file.
The latter file apparently records a conversation between a call attendant at Crime Stoppers Australia and a Police officer.
Transcripts of proceedings in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and transcripts of further applications for special leave in the High Court, including an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal where the Tribunal had found and the High Court affirmed an absence of jurisdiction, were also provided ( Druett v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services (Unreported, High Court of Australia, Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Heydon JJ, 13 May 2003)).
5 Some of the additional material was received after the date for filing and serving of written submissions had passed.
The Department has no objection to the Court having regard to that material.
6 I have had regard to the matters put to me by Mr Druett and also to the matters in the affidavit and the additional material.
The decision of the Tribunal 
 
7 In the decision the subject of this appeal, the Tribunal noted that no respondent had been identified and that Mr Druett was the only party to appear ( Druett and No Respondent [2006] AATA 1043).
The Tribunal invited Mr Druett to identify the decision as to which he sought review.
Mr Druett was unable to refer to one particular decision but gave the Tribunal a history that he considered to be unfair (at [3]).
