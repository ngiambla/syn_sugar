1 Mr Bassam Dekkan seeks an order setting aside Bankruptcy Notice NN 0324/08 served on 17 February 2008.
The notice was issued upon the basis of a number of judgments obtained in the Local Court by Uther Webster  Evans, Solicitors, for outstanding legal fees.
The amount of the judgments totalled approximately $46,000.
2 Mr Dekkan appeared in person on the application.
The substance of his claim to set aside the bankruptcy notice was that he had a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debts in accordance with s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).
3 The effect of Mr Dekkan's claim is that the solicitors were negligent in the advice they gave him as to how he should seek to set aside an adverse judgment obtained against Mr Dekkan by a Mrs Picciau in the District Court.
He also claimed that Ms Vivian Evans, a partner in the firm of solicitors, had failed, unreasonably, to assist him by giving evidence in an appeal from the District Court judgment.
4 In addition, Mr Dekkan alleged that the solicitors had made charged amounted to improper fees for the handling of a local court proceeding against Mrs Picciau, which involved a claim for an apprehended violence order.
5 Mr Dekkan made various claims of overcharging in relation to the handling of his affairs.
He joined Ms Evans as a respondent to the present applications, as well as Ms Zoe Ramsay, who was the solicitor assisting Ms Evans in the conduct of Mr Dekkan's proceedings.
6 Although, as Lockhart J said in Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 30 ALR 433 at 439, the Court is not required to undertake a preliminary trial of the counter-claim, set-off or cross demand, a substantial body of evidence was adduced at the hearing.
7 The evidence consisted of two affidavits of Mr Dekkan and an affidavit of each of Ms Evans and Ms Ramsay.
Having regard to the background of the matter and the overall circumstances, I permitted Mr Dekkan to cross-examine Ms Evans and Ms Ramsay.
8 At the start of the hearing Mr Dekkan filed a notice of motion seeking to have the hearing adjourned due to his mental and physical condition which he said prevented him from adequately dealing with the matter.
He went into the witness box and was cross-examined.
9 I dismissed the motion but the matters relied upon by Mr Dekkan on the motion are relevant to a consideration of the application to set aside the bankruptcy notice.
This is because Mr Dekkan's medical problems contributed to the situation which resulted in the judgment against him in the District Court.
The retainer of the solicitors 
 
10 In about February 2007 Mr Dekkan met with Ms Evans for the purpose of retaining her firm to act for him in order to obtain possession from Mrs Picciau of a property owned by Mr Dekkan at 806/11 Jacobs Street, Bankstown.
11 Mr Dekkan says in his affidavit of 27 March 2008 that the purpose of the meeting with Ms Evans was to lodge an appeal in the New South Wales Court of Appeal against Mrs Picciau.
Whether or not this was the limit of the retainer at that time is not entirely clear.
It appears from the evidence before me that it became apparent at the first meeting that Mr Dekkan wanted to obtain possession of the property, which was occupied by Mrs Picciau, but that he was prevented from doing so because of the judgment against him in the District Court.
12 The terms of the retainer seem to have been to advise, and take such other action as may be necessary, to set aside the judgment in the District Court.
The judgment was for less than $100,000 and leave to appeal was therefore required.
The judgment was obtained ex parte , in very unusual circumstances, as is explained in the judgment of the Court of Appeal referred to below.
13 Ms Ramsay was present at Uther Wesbster Evans's first meeting with Mr Dekkan.
Ms Evans informed Mr Dekkan that Ms Ramsay's hourly rates were lower than hers and that she would therefore arrange for Ms Ramsay to work on the matter where appropriate to save some legal expenses.
14 An application for leave to appeal was filed in the Court of Appeal in February 2007.
It is not clear from the evidence whether the application was filed by Ms Evans's firm or whether it had been filed by the previous firm acting for Mr Dekkan.
15 Uther Webster  Evans acted for Mr Dekkan until June 2007 when the retainer was terminated.
Mr Dekkan asserts that Ms Evans terminated the retainer but Ms Evans's evidence was that Mr Dekkan terminated the firm's services.
It is not necessary to decide who terminated the retainer.
What is important is that the firm ceased to act in about June 2007 when it was replaced by another firm of solicitors.
16 During the period from February 2007 to June 2007 the retainer of Uther Webster  Evans was extended to cover various other aspects Mr Dekkan's business affairs which related, inter alia , to certain dealings with Mrs Picciau.
17 The retainer was also extended to cover the proceedings involving Mrs Picciau and the claim for an apprehended violence order.
The District Court proceedings 
 
18 The relevant details of the District Court proceedings are set out in the judgment of Basten JA (with whom Hodgson and Tobias JJA agreed) on the application for leave to appeal: Dekkan v Picciau [2008] NSWCA 18.
19 When the hearing in the District Court commenced on 25 October 2006, Mr Dekkan was represented by a solicitor, Mr Joseph Johnson of Bruce Dennis  Co. At the commencement of the hearing Mr Johnson applied to vacate the hearing on the ground that Mr Dekkan was "in a psychiatric hospital".
20 Evidence was given by Mr Dekkan's psychiatrist, Dr Selwyn Smith, that Mr Dekkan was experiencing a major depressive episode.
21 The trial judge, Kearns DCJ, heard cross-examination of Dr Smith (by telephone) that Mr Dekkan was capable of giving instructions and attending Court.
The hearing proceeded on 25 October 2006 without further incident but there was a dramatic turn of events on the following day.
22 The events of 26 October 2006 are recorded in the judgment of Basten JA at [15]ff.
