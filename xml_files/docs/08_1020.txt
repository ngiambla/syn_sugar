 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 These reasons relate to a complex discovery dispute.
Over a period the parties have managed to reach agreement in relation to many categories of documents.
Their efforts are to be commended.
The categories on which a decision is required are set out in an annexure to these reasons for judgment.
On the second day of the hearing, the applicant (the University) proposed amendments to a number of those categories on the basis that the University may seek discovery of the original categories at a later date.
The respondent (ResMed) opposed such a course.
I discuss this proposal in more detail at [82]ff below.
2 The University is the registered proprietor of Australian Patent No 643994 for an invention entitled "Nasal mask" (the Patent).
Its priority date is 21 May 1990.
3 At the heart of the parties' dispute is a written agreement dated 17 May 1991 entitled "Licensing Agreement" between the University and ResMed (the Agreement).
In the Agreement ResMed is called "the Licensee".
4 The University sues ResMed for infringement of the Patent and for breach of the Agreement.
The question whether the categories of documents in dispute are discoverable turns largely on the Agreement and on a proper construction of the University's further amended statement of claim (FASOC).
ResMed has filed a further amended defence and an amended cross-claim.
5 ResMed resists discovery on grounds of relevance and oppressiveness, that is to say, that the categories in dispute are not relevant for discovery purposes (see [40] below) to the issues raised on the FASOC, and to the extent that any of them are relevant for those purposes, it would be oppressive for ResMed to have to give discovery of them.
6 In accordance with a suggestion made by ResMed, I have decided to publish these reasons addressing, for the present interlocutory purposes only, certain questions of construction and other issues in the hope that the parties in the light of the reasons may yet be able to agree on the course to be followed.
If they cannot do so, I will deliver the remaining instalment of the reasons and make orders.
7 I decide nothing finally on this interlocutory application.
For one thing, I note that the Agreement is not to be construed in a vacuum, and I do not have before me evidence of the background against which it was entered into and which could bear upon its proper construction.
However, I am required to form tentative views for the purposes of the exercise of my discretion on the discovery of the dispute.
THE AGREEMENT 
 
8 The Agreement provides for the grant of a licence by the University to ResMed to use the "Intellectual Property" as defined in the Agreement for the purposes set forth in the Agreement.
9 The expression "Intellectual Property" is defined in cl 1 of the Agreement to mean:
 the trademarks, patents, copyrights, processes, know-how, registered designs or other like rights particulars of which are set forth in Schedule 2.
Schedule 2 is as follows:
 
 
 (a) Patent Applications in respect of an invention entitled Nasal Mask 
 Australian Applic No PK0228 Filed 21 May 1990.

 
 
 
 (b) Information and know-how relating to the Nasal Mask but not including that information which was known by the Licensee or which was in the public domain prior to 21 May 1990.

 

The reference to PK0228 is a reference to a provisional application (Provisional Application).
In fact the Patent, a standard patent, was granted on a complete application that was associated with the provisional application.
10 Another important definition in the Agreement is that of "Product", which is defined in cl 1 to mean:
 the products and/or processes set forth in Schedule 4 which incorporate the use of the Intellectual Property.
The expression "Products and/or processes" is defined in cl 1 of the Agreement to include "technologies, products, devices, processes or techniques".
However, Schedule 4, which is headed "The Product", states simply "Nasal Mask".
Notwithstanding the reference to "products and/or processes" in the definition of "Product" and to "technologies, products, devices, processes or techniques" in the definition of "Products and/or processes", it seems clear that the Product is simply the physical Nasal Mask product that was the subject of the invention the subject of the Patent.
11 By cl 3.1 of the Agreement the University granted to ResMed an exclusive world-wide licence to use the Intellectual Property to manufacture and market the Product.
Clearly the "Product" was taken here to be a physical thing.
The term of the licence was from 1 January 1991 to 7 December 1992, but upon ResMed's request the University might grant an extension for a period to be agreed.
12 By cl 3.2 the University undertook to furnish the Intellectual Property to ResMed for the purposes of the Agreement in the manner and at the time stipulated in Schedule 7 to the Agreement.
Schedule 7 stated:
 The University will supply the Licensee with a copy of the provisional patent specification referred to in Schedule 2, detailed information provided by Associate Professor Colin Sullivan and a working prototype of the Nasal Mask.
13 By cl 3.3 of the Agreement, ResMed undertook not to use the Intellectual Property for any purpose other than that permitted by cl 3.1, which was "to manufacture and market the Product".
Again, "Product" refers to the physical thing.
14 Clause 5 provided for payment of licence fees by ResMed to the University in the manner and at the time set forth in Schedule 3 to the Agreement.
Schedule 3 stated a certain percentage of the "Net Ex-works Selling Price of all Product sold".
15 Clause 11.1 provided that should ResMed or any agent, servant or employee of ResMed make or discover any "improvement" in connection with the Intellectual Property, whether patentable or not, ResMed must forthwith disclose or cause to be disclosed to the University any information concerning that discovery or improvement, and, if so required by the University, must make available or supply to the University all information or data necessary or convenient for the proper understanding or development of the discovery or improvement, which discovery or improvement was to "belong to and be the absolute property of the University".
16 Clause 11.2 of the Agreement provided:
 The University will if requested by the Licensee grant to the Licensee a licence or licences to use, exercise and develop such discovery or improvement each upon the same terms and conditions as are herein contained but upon payment of such additional royalty or royalties as may be agreed.
THE FURTHER AMENDED STATEMENT OF CLAIM 
 
17 The following is a summary account of the FASOC.
Numbers in bold in brackets indicate paragraphs of those numbers in the FASOC.
Claim pursuant to cl 5 of the Agreement 
 
18 The FASOC begins by pleading both the Patent and various provisions of the Agreement ( 5---13 ).
In particular, it was a term of the Agreement that the University granted to ResMed a licence to use the Intellectual Property as defined in the Agreement to manufacture and market the Product as defined in the Agreement ( 10 ).
19 Commencing in or about August 1997 and continuing to date, ResMed has sold a "Mirage" series of twelve nasal masks ( 14 ).
The names of the masks in the series are set out in particulars to para 14, but the Mirage series is called "the Mirage Mask" in the FASOC.
Inconsistently with this definition, however, at various later points in the FASOC, the term "Mirage Mask" is used to refer to one particular mask in the series, rather than the entire series (for example, in the particulars to para 14 itself, the first mask in the series of twelve nasal masks listed is called "The Mirage Mask").
20 The Mirage Mask is a Product within the meaning of the Agreement, being a nasal mask that incorporates the use of the Intellectual Property ( 15 ).
According to subparas (a) and (b) of para 15, the Mirage Mask consists of or incorporates the use of the Intellectual Property because it consists of or incorporates the invention disclosed in the Provisional Application.
According to subparas (c), (d) and (e) of para 15, the Mirage Mask possesses certain integers of certain claims of the Provisional Application, and this is a further reason why the Mirage Mask incorporates the use of the Intellectual Property.
21 Subparagraph (f) of para 15 alleges, further or in the alternative, that the Mirage Mask incorporates the invention disclosed in the Patent itself, and subpara (g) alleges, further or in the alternative, that the Mirage Mask incorporates "information and know-how relating to the nasal mask, being the nasal mask disclosed in the Provisional Application".
22 Subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) are akin to a conventional pleading of patent infringement --- the possession of the integers of claims.
But subparas (f) and (g) are broader.
The Mirage Mask is there said to incorporate the invention disclosed in the Patent, or to incorporate "information and know-how relating to the nasal mask ... disclosed in the Provisional Application".
23 The University emphasises that its case is not simply one of patent infringement.
As will be seen, its breach of contract claim depends on a chain of causation from the invention the subject of the Patent and from the other elements of the Intellectual Property irrespective of whether they result in a product involved in an infringement of the Patent or are objectively apparent in any final product.
I discuss this issue in more detail at [60]ff below.
24 In breach of the Agreement, ResMed has not paid the University licence fees in respect of the sales of the Mirage Mask, in consequence of which the University has suffered and continues to suffer loss and damage ( 16 , 17 ).
Claims pursuant to cl 11 of the Agreement 
 
25 Paragraphs 19---26 of the FASOC plead a claim based on cl 11 of the Agreement.
26 After pleading cll 11.1 and 11.2 of the Agreement, ResMed alleges that if, contrary to para 15, any Mirage Mask (the Relevant Mask) is not a Product, the Relevant Mask nonetheless is or incorporates a discovery or improvement in connection with the Intellectual Property, and therefore, pursuant to cl 11.1 of the Agreement, belongs to and is the absolute property of the University ( 22 ).
