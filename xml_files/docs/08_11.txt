 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 While a prisoner at the Darwin Correctional Centre, the applicant completed an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa (Subclass 866).
With the assistance of the Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission the completed application was forwarded to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (the Department) under cover of a letter dated 6 June 2006, and it was received by the Department on 8 June 2006.
As the relevant application fee was not paid to the Department until 16 June 2006, the application was treated as having been made on 16 June 2006.
2 Section 65A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) requires that the Minister make a decision either to grant the visa or to refuse to grant the visa within 90 days starting on the day on which the application was made.
That period expired in September 2006.
Notwithstanding this clear and unqualified requirement, no decision has yet been made on the application --- some 16 months after the expiry of the 90 day period and some 19 months after the making of the application.
The applicant has been in immigration detention throughout.
3 Clearly there was an egregious failure by the Minister to obey the Parliament's command.
4 In addition to other relief, the applicant seeks an order in the nature of mandamus requiring the Minister to determine the application for the Protection visa according to law.
Counsel for the Minister offered no submission against the making of such an order.
If such an order is to be made, it is desirable that it incorporate a time limit and that is something on which I would wish to give the parties an opportunity to be heard.
5 Is it appropriate to make such an order in circumstances in which legislation so unequivocally requires that a decision be made within 90 days starting on 16 June 2006?
Arguably, the very making of the order detracts from the unequivocal demand of s 65A of the Act and from the Ministerial failure to comply with it for some 16 months.
6 The making of an order would, however, add the prospect of contempt of court by the Minister if the Minister were not to comply within the time fixed in the order.
In this respect an order in the nature of mandamus would have utility.
7 Subject to giving the parties the opportunity to make submissions, my present intention is to make an order of the kind mentioned.
8 Also subject to considering the parties' submissions, I propose to order the Minister to pay the applicant's costs, even though, for the reasons that will appear below, the applicant has failed on the other issues raised by him.
The applicant commenced this proceeding on 31 July 2007 as a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia and the proceeding was subsequently transferred to this Court.
The event which was the immediate stimulus for the launch of the proceeding was the sending of a Notice of Intention to Consider Refusal (NOICR) of the visa application under s 501(1) of the Act on 18 July 2007.
However, previously pleas had been made by and on behalf of the applicant over a long period for a decision to be taken on his application.
In substance, he was forced to litigate in an attempt to compel the Minister to comply with s 65A of the Act, albeit so very late.
In the circumstances I think it is a proper exercise of discretion for me to order the Minister to pay the applicant's costs.
BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
9 The applicant is a national of Iraq.
He claims to have been persecuted by the Saddam Hussein rgime and to have spent some six years in Abu Ghraib gaol.
He claims to have fled Iraq, and then to have spent time in Iran, Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia.
10 The applicant arrived in Australia on 22 February 2003 on a criminal justice entry visa after extradition from Thailand to face charges of "people smuggling" under s 232A of the Act, or in the alternative, s 233(1)(a) of the Act.
The allegation was that the applicant had been responsible for the organisation of the arrival of four boats of illegal immigrants over a period of one year in 2000 and 2001 and that he was reckless as to whether or not those persons had a lawful right to come to Australia.
11 The applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of the offence and asked the Court to take a further count into consideration.
He was convicted of the offences in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and on 21 September 2004 was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment commencing on 17 June 2002, with a non parole period of four years.
12 The period of the applicant's imprisonment, and his criminal justice entry visa, expired at midnight on 15 June 2006.
On 16 June 2006, he was taken into immigration detention, and shortly afterwards, at his request, transferred to the Immigration Detention Centre in Villawood, Sydney.
13 The applicant's mother, three sisters and three brothers live in Australia, some or all of them at Villawood.
The applicant's mother and siblings came to Australia as illegal immigrants on the vessels organised by the applicant, and apparently have been recognised as having refugee status.
The applicant's wife and daughter live in Indonesia and his father and another brother still live in Iraq.
The applicant claims that a further brother was killed by the Saddam Hussein rgime.
14 The application for the Protection (Class XA) visa made on 16 June 2006 (see [1] above) was also treated as an application for a Bridging visa (Bridging Visa E) (Subclass 050) and as an application for a Temporary Protection visa (Subclass 785).
In his application, the applicant gave as details of his employment between 1999 and 2002 that in Malaysia and Indonesia he had been "helping with people smuggling".
His frankness may suggest that he saw nothing to be ashamed of in what he had been doing.
15 On 7 July 2006, then Minister Vanstone refused the application for the Bridging visa under s 501 of the Act, on the basis that the applicant had a "substantial criminal record" (see s 501(6)(a)).
The applicant's conviction within the four years preceding his application meant that he did not satisfy the criteria for the grant of a Subclass 866 Permanent Protection visa, but was to be considered for the grant of a Subclass 785 Temporary Protection visa.
16 The application for the Protection visa was for a time dealt with by a s 65 delegate, Ms Kate Watson, who authored a "Decision Record" document which she signed and dated 5 December 2006.
There is a question as to the status of that document, particularly in the light of two further documents authored by Ms Watson that accompanied it.
Those two documents, to which I will refer as "the annexures", were in the nature of briefing memoranda addressed to other Departmental officers, because, for reasons that the evidence does not reveal, Ms Watson ceased to be the Case Manager of the applicant's application in or about December 2006.
17 Before she parted with the matter, Ms Watson, whose position was "Case Manager, Onshore Protection, NSW", wrote in October 2006 to the "Director, Character and Cancellation Section" requesting a waiver of an internal Departmental requirement of a "police clearance certificate" or "penal clearance" from Iran where the applicant had resided for a time.
The applicant's adviser had obtained such a certificate from Indonesia where the applicant had also resided, but apparently it was not the policy of the Iranian Government to issue such certificates in relation to people such as the applicant who had resided in Iran unlawfully, that is to say, without an Iranian visa.
I discuss the waiver of this requirement at [107]-[109] below.
18 In the time that has passed from 5 December 2006 to date, various officers of the Department have been occupied with questions relating to the waiver of the requirement of an Iranian police clearance certificate and to the applicant's character more generally.
The Departmental documents in evidence show that there were different views held within the Department concerning the relationship between ss 65 and 501 of the Act, and that there were changes in the administrative arrangements within the Department for dealing with applications that raised overlapping ss 65 and 501 issues.
19 It is not necessary to describe in detail the various positions that were taken by various officers from time to time.
However, it is helpful to note the following events.
20 On 30 March 2007, Nicole Pearson, Director, Character Policy, Character Assessment and War Crimes Screening Branch, expressed several concerns over aspects of the handling of the applicant's application.
