 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant ("OMI") holds Australian Patent No 775427 entitled "A Single Use Syringe" (the "OMI patent").
The respondent ("RTI") is entitled to exploit the invention which is the subject of Australian Patent No 701878, entitled "Tamperproof Retractable Syringe" (the "RTI patent").
2 In letters dated 5 October 2004 and 24 March 2006, RTI's legal advisers asserted or implied that OMI was infringing, or proposing to infringe, RTI's intellectual property and other rights including, in particular, those held in connection with the RTI patent.
These allegations apparently arose out of the proposed exploitation by OMI of the OMI patent.
OMI commenced proceedings for a declaration that RTI had made unjustifiable threats and for interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief.
I found that the letter of 5 October 2004 contained unjustifiable threats and declared accordingly.
I found that the letter of 24 March 2006 did not contain unjustifiable threats.
In the course of these proceedings OMI indicated that it proposed to seek a declaration of non-infringement pursuant to s 125 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the "Act").
A prayer for such relief appears in OMI's second further amended statement of claim.
However the application seems not to have been amended.
OMI should seek leave to amend the application to add such a prayer.
THE ACT 
 
3 In Part 2 of Chapter 11 of the Act, ss 124 to 127 provide as follows:
 124 Interpretation 
 
 In this Part: 
 patentee includes an exclusive licensee.

 
 125 Application for non-infringement declaration 
 
 
 (1) A person who wishes to exploit an invention may apply to a prescribed court for a declaration that the exploitation of the invention would not infringe a claim of a particular complete specification.

 
 (2) An Application may be made: 
 
 
(a) at any time after the complete specification has become open to public inspection; and (b) whether or not the nominated person or patentee has made any assertion to the effect that the exploitation of the invention would infringe the claim.

 
 
 
 (3) The nominated person or patentee must be joined as a respondent in the proceedings.

 
 
 
126 Proceedings for non-infringement declarations 
 
 
 (1) A prescribed court must not make a non-infringement declaration unless a patent has been granted in respect of the relevant invention and; 
 
 
(a) the applicant for the declaration: (i) has asked the nominated person or patentee in writing for a written admission that the proposed exploitation would not infringe a claim of the complete specification; and (ii) has given the nominated person or patentee full written particulars of the proposed exploitation; and (iii) has undertaken to pay a reasonable sum for the nominated person's or patentee's expenses in obtaining advice about whether the proposed exploitation would infringe the claim; and (b) the nominated person or patentee has refused or failed to make the admission; and (c) if the patent is an innovation patent --- the patent has been certified.

 
 
 (2) The validity of a claim cannot be questioned in proceedings for a non-infringement declaration.

 
 (3) The costs of all parties in proceedings for a non-infringement declaration must be paid by the applicant for the declaration unless the court otherwise orders.

 
 
 
127 Effect of non-infringement declarations 
 
 
 If: 
 
 (a) a nominated person or patentee has given a person a written admission that the exploitation of an invention would not infringe a claim, or a prescribed court has made a non-infringement declaration in respect of an invention; and 
 
 (b) the patentee later gets an injunction restraining the person from exploiting the invention as specified in the admission, or the declaration is revoked; 
 
 the person is not liable: 
 
 (c) to account to the patentee for any profits, made by the person before the date on which the injunction was granted or the declaration was revoked, from the exploitation of the invention as specified in the admission or declaration; or 
 
 (d) to pay damages for any loss suffered by the patentee before that date as a result of that exploitation.

 
 
 
 A CONSTRUCTION QUESTION 
 
4 There is some superficial difficulty in understanding these sections.
Although OMI asserts that it proposes to exploit its patent rights, and that the s 125 application relates to such proposed exploitation, it submits that even if such proposed exploitation were not of its patent rights, it would be entitled to a declaration.
RTI submits that s 125 relief is only available if the proposed exploitation is of OMI's patent rights.
5 The regime established by Part 2 contemplates there being two parties, each claiming certain rights pursuant to the Act.
The person identified in subs 125(1) is a person who is entitled to exploit an invention as defined in the dictionary.
I infer that such invention must be the subject matter of a patent or a patent application.
I will refer to that person as the "applicant".
The person described in subs 125(2) as the "nominated person or patentee" is a person who holds a patent, or has applied for a patent and filed a complete specification.
I will refer to that person as the "respondent".
It is important to note that the word "invention" is used to describe the subject matter of the applicant's rights.
On the other hand, the subject matter of the respondent's rights is described as "a claim of a particular complete specification".
6 The applicant will be entitled to apply under s 125 if he or she wishes lawfully to exploit the relevant invention.
However subs 126(1) provides that no declaration may be made unless and until a patent has been granted for the invention.
In my view the patent referred to in subs 126(1) and para 126(1)(c) is that which relates to the invention which the applicant proposes to exploit.
The reference in subs 126(1) to the "nominated person or patentee" is to the respondent and not to the holder of such patent.
The use of the words "invention" and "claim of a particular complete specification" in subs 125(1) has led me to that view.
However there is another reason for it.
If s 126 were interpreted as referring to a patent held by the respondent, the operation of Part 2 would be greatly reduced.
An applicant would not be able to obtain a declaration until after the respondent's patent had been granted (and, in the case of an innovation patent, certified).
He or she could not safely exploit his or her invention for a period which might be quite lengthy.
On the other hand there are good policy reasons for limiting the availability of relief under Part 2 to a person who wishes to exploit a patent which has been granted, excluding mere applicants whose rights have not been finally determined.
OMI must demonstrate an intention to exploit the OMI patent.
