Earlier in the course of the trial objection was taken on behalf of the Defendants to the then form of the charges on the basis that they were duplex.
After consideration of the submissions made on behalf of the Defendants, the prosecution determined that the appropriate course to take was to make an election.
The result of that election, as well as other amendments which were sought and which became the subject of leave, is now reflected in an amended information and summons which is presently Exhibit 2.
Schedule A reflects the charges as made after the amendment.
2 It is not necessary to elaborate upon the occasion for the amendment which resulted from the concession as to duplicity.
I delivered short ex tempore reasons separately on that subject in the course of the trial.
The effect, though, of the amendment is materially that, in respect of each charge, there is but one diamond which is the subject of the alleged criminal conduct.
That conduct is said to amount to a breach of s 75AZC(1)(g) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("Trade Practices Act").
So far as presently material that section provides:
 Section 75AZC False or misleading representations A corporation must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services, or in connection with the promotion, by any means, of the supply or use of goods or services, do any of the following: (a) ... (b) ... (g) Make a false or misleading representation about the price of goods or services.
3 The Corporate Defendant is a company presently known as Carrerabenz Diamond Industries Proprietary Limited.
That company was originally known as Kleen Artefacts Proprietary Limited, its Australian Company Number is ACN098 814 227.
It was incorporated in Queensland on 20 November 2001.
A Mr Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary is and, at all material times has been, the sole director and secretary of that company.
He is also the owner of the only issued share in that company.
The business of the Corporate Defendant has, at all times material to these proceedings, been the buying and selling of diamonds and other items of jewellery.
The effect of the course taken by the prosecution is that the proceedings, insofar as they alleged originally that Mr Chaudhary was knowingly concerned in the offences alleged against the Corporate Defendant, must be dismissed.
4 What remains then is the question as to the appropriate penalty to impose, by way of fine, on the Corporate Defendant.
It is necessary, first, to make some, albeit brief reference to the nature of the offending conduct as was disclosed in the material put before me for the purposes of sentencing.
That material, so far as background facts are concerned, principally comprised Exhibit 1.
Exhibit 1 was the written statement of the opening made by the prosecution in respect of the charges as originally drawn.
In light of the course of events, care must be taken in the reading of Exhibit 1 so as to recall the nature of the amendments that are made to the charges and, further, to recall that it is not the case that Mr Chaudhary is any longer in jeopardy in respect of an allegation of being knowingly concerned in respect of offences against the Trade Practices Act .
5 In their amended form the charges, in a collective sense, might be said to allege that, on six occasions the Corporate Defendant placed newspaper advertisements advertising diamond sales which described various items of jewellery, one only being the subject of each charge in amended form, showing a "usual mark.price" and a "crazy price" in respect of that particular jewellery item.
6 The case for the Commission, which is by the plea now conceded by the Corporate Defendant, is that these descriptions grounded offences against s 75AZC(1)(g) of the Trade Practices Act .
The way that particular offence has been particularised is as follows.
First, the advertisement would have led a reasonable person to believe that the diamond in question had previously been offered for sale to the general public at a "usual mark.price" and was now being offered for sale for a limited period at a substantially lower "crazy price".
Second, each advertisement would have led such a person to believe that if they purchased the diamond in question in each instance, that they would obtain a substantial saving, which amounted to the difference between those two prices, as described.
Third, the representation in the advertisement in question in each instance that there would, for a limited period, be substantial reductions to the "crazy price" from prices which had previously been charged for the diamonds, was misleading, in that in each instance, the diamond in question had never previously been offered for sale to the general public at the "usual mark.price.
" So much now is accepted by the Corporate Defendant.
7 It is very important in the context of sentencing to recall what this case is not about.
It is no part of the prosecution case that it concerns a price at which a member of the public might have been able to purchase a diamond of comparable quality, size and description in the marketplace to that diamond which has become the subject of a particular amended charge.
Rather, what is put forward by the prosecution is that the Corporate Defendant has misleadingly advertised to the public that the particular diamond, the subject of a particular amended charge, was previously offered for sale to the general public at the usual marked price, when in fact, each particular diamond had not previously been offered for sale at the "usual mark.price".
8 The 27 offences alleged against the Corporate Defendant arise from six advertisements placed in metropolitan newspapers on the following dates, and they relate to what have been described as "exhibition sales" of jewellery at the following places: 
 
(a) 17 January 2003, Herald Sun, Melbourne, Crown Towers, Melbourne; 
 
(b) 24 January 2003, Daily Telegraph, Sydney, Star Casino, Sydney; 
 
(c) 26 January 2003, Sunday Telegraph, Sydney, Star Casino, Sydney; 
 
(d) 21 February 2003, West Australian, Perth, Burswood Convention Centre; 
 
(e) 1 March 2003, West Australian, Perth, Burswood Convention Centre; 
 
(f) 8 March 2003, The Advertiser, Adelaide, Hyatt Regency Hotel.
9 In all, there are 25 diamonds which are the subject of reference in the 27 charges.
The occasion for the difference is that in some instances, an advertisement was placed such that it appeared on two days.
In each advertisement, the diamond in question is identified by a discrete alphanumeric stock number.
The form of the advertisements differed somewhat in terms of the entitlement of the advertisement.
For example, that which appears in the Herald Sun was entitled:
 Public Notice The Final Sale Diamond Clearance View the most spectacular collection of exquisite certified diamonds and diamond jewellery ever gathered in Australia at prices never seen before.
10 That which appeared, for example, in The Adelaide Advertiser had a different entitlement.
It was as follows: 
 Under Instructions from the Official Court Appointed Liquidator Diamond Clearance Carrerabenz has been officially instructed to sell all remaining diamonds up to 70 per cent off usual marked prices!
11 It should be noted that it is no part of the prosecution case that any of the diamonds in question were the subject of an instruction from a court appointed liquidator for sale, although there were other diamonds that were the subject of such instruction.
They do not form part of the alleged offending conduct, and neither, it must be emphasised, is there any allegation of any misleading quality in relation to that generic heading.
I therefore do not take that particular aspect of the general descriptor into account adversely, as against the Corporate Defendant.
12 The Corporate Defendant did have a system in relation to the pricing after receipt of jewellery purchased by it in the course of the conduct of its business.
An affidavit from a person once employed as an accountant in the Corporate Defendant's office at Bundall, on the Gold Coast, has deposed to the nature of that system in an affidavit particular paragraphs of which were read before me in the course of sentencing submissions.
13 From that it emerges that the Corporate Defendant did not have a fixed retail outlet in the sense of having a store front, as the nature of its business was the sale of jewellery at exhibition venues.
Thus the Corporate Defendant rarely sold jewellery from its Bundall office.
Any such sales were of an ad hoc nature and insignificant in number compared with the total sales of the Corporate Defendant.
The system employed was that upon the delivery of jewellery to the Corporate Defendant's Bundall office, staff would, in general, sort, tag and price each item and then arrange for an independent appraisal.
The staff would write a unique alphanumeric stock number on the particular supplier invoice for each item of jewellery.
This was done so as to identify each item for tagging with the particular relevant stock number.
14 The First Defendant, after purchasing an item of jewellery, adopted a formula by which its cost price was marked up either by its director or employees.
This would then be entered into the Corporate Defendant's computer system as a recommended retail price.
A subordinate officer of the Corporate Defendant was engaged in the task of recording on tags for each item of jewellery, on one side of the tag a stock number together with some information relating to carat size and clarity in the case of diamonds.
On the other side of the tag the staff member would, as a matter of system, write two prices, one in red ink which was then immediately crossed out with a lower price being written underneath it in black ink.
The staff member wrote these prices from information written on copies of invoices.
That task was of a clerical nature and, it would seem, followed the making of pricing decisions by a more senior person in the company.
15 The case for the Commission was, and remains, that the mischief involved is similar to that which was disclosed in Trade Practices Commission v Cue Design Pty Ltd  Anor (1996) 85 A Crim R 500.
So it is that the submission of the Commission is that the following passage from the reasons for judgment in that case, at page 505, is apposite:
 What I need to determine, for the purpose of assessing penalty, is Cue's motive in involving itself in the dual-priced swing tags in the manner in which it did.
If [the product manager] truthfully stated that it did not occur to her that members of the buying public would infer from the two prices that the garments had been on sale at the higher prices for any substantial period of time then she is either very naive or recklessly indifferent to the perceptions of the buying public.
16 Then a little later :
 In my opinion, the natural and probable consequence of a dual-priced swing tag is that members of the buying public would assume that the garment had previously been offered for sale at the higher of the two prices and was now available at the lower price.
17 Then a little later still, at page 508:
 I regard the conduct of the defendants as serious breaches of the TPA.
It was conduct that preyed on the gullibility of the public.
18 The case for the Commission which is, in effect, accepted now by the plea of guilty, is that the practice revealed in these advertisements in the specification of the "usual mark.price" and "crazy price" reveals the same type of breach.
That is certainly one way in which one might view the advertisements in question and I propose to sentence the Corporate Defendant on that basis.
In so doing, I recall, though, a response which the Corporate Defendant gave to a notice which had been directed to it by the Commission under s 155 of the Trade Practices Act .
In that response the Corporate Defendant stated as follows:
 The usual marked price of the items was calculated utilising a standard formula that the company has adopted for a number of years to calculate its retail prices, namely, four times the wholesale price of the item.
