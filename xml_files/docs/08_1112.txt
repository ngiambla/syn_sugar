 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 By its further amended application dated 30 January 2008 ('the FAA'), leave for the filing of which I granted on the same date, the applicant, Donald Financial Enterprises Pty Limited ('DFE'), as trustee of a trust fund known as 'The Elysum Trust', claims relief in respect of DFE's subscription for 200,000 shares in the first respondent, APIR Systems Limited ('APIR'), and in respect of DFE's purchase of 81,904 shares in APIR from existing shareholders.
The FAA is stated to be made under ss 1041E , 1041H , 1041I , 1325 (1) and (5) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth); ss 12DA and 12GM of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ('the ASIC Act'); and ss 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the TP Act').
2 The bases for DFE's claims for relief, set out in DFE's Second Further Amended Statement of Claim dated 16 March 2006 ('the SFASC'), are that the respondents jointly and each of them severally: 
 
(1) engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive contrary to s 52 of the TP Act, s 12 of the Fair Trading Act 1992 (ACT) ('the ACT Act') and/or engaged in conduct in relation to a financial product or a financial service that was misleading or deceptive or was likely to mislead or deceive contrary to s 1041H of the Corporations Act 2001 and/or subs 12DA(1) of the ASIC Act;
 
(2) engaged in conduct in contravention of s 1041E of the Corporations Act 2001 ; and
 
that by engaging in such conduct, the second to sixth respondents, jointly and each of them severally:
 
 
 (3) (i) aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contraventions of s 52 of the TP Act and/or s 12 of the ACT Act by APIR; and
 (ii) have been directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in or party to the aforesaid contravention; and
 (iii) have conspired to effect the contraventions as contemplated by s 75B of the TP Act and s 40 of the ACT Act respectively, together with s 12GB of the ASIC Act in relation to contraventions to s 12DA of that Act.

 

(4) was involved in the contravention of the aforesaid Acts (namely the TP Act, the ACT Act, the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASIC Act), as contemplated and referred to in s 82 and s 87 of the TP Act and s 46 of the ACT Act and further was engaged in the aforesaid contraventions as contemplated in s 1041I, s 1324, subs 1325(1) and subs 1325(5) of the C orporations Act 2001 together with s 12GH and s 12GM of the ASIC Act.
(5) both directed and/or procured the aforesaid contraventions of the statutory obligations of APIR and/or engaged in the deliberate wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement and/or reflected an indifference to the risk of infringements of the aforesaid statutory obligations.
3 By an amended cross-claim dated 21 August 2006 and filed on 4 September 2006 ('the ACC'), APIR claims various forms of relief against Mr Donald Sharp ('Mr Sharp'), the sole director of DFE, and DFE, as trustee of The Elysum Trust, on the following bases:
 
(1) During negotiations leading up to the transactions described in [1] above, Mr Sharp and DFE engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead APIR within the meaning of s 12DA of the ASIC Act and/or s 12 of the ACT Act and/or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) ('the NSW Act') and/or s 1041H of the Corporations Act 2001 ; and such conduct constituted representations as to a future matter within the meaning of s 12BB of the ASIC Act, s 41 of the NSW Act, s 11 of the ACT Act, which Mr Sharp and DFE had no reasonable grounds to make.
(2) that the conduct of Mr Sharp and/or DFE was unconscionable conduct in trade and commerce within the meaning of s 12CA of the ASIC Act and/or s 13 of the ACT Act; and/or s 43 of the NSW Act;
 
(3) that Mr Sharp in his capacity as the sole director of DFE:
 
 
 (a) aided counselled and/or abetted; and/or
 (b) induced; and/or
 (c) conspired with DFE 
 

to contravene ss 12DA, 12BB and 12CA of the ASIC Act within the meaning of subs 12GB(1) of the ASIC Act; s 61 of the NSW Act; and/or s 40 of the ACT Act;
 
(4) in the alternative, for breach of clause 6.1 and clause 6.2 of a Share Subscription Deed between APIR, DFE and Mr Sharp dated 23 January 2004 ('the SSD').
BACKGROUND 
 
4 APIR was incorporated on 15 December 1997 as a proprietary company and on 7 February 2003 converted to a public company.
Its first directors were the second respondent, Mr Andrew Hutchings Broso ('Mr Hutchings Broso'), the third respondent, Mr Andrew Riley ('Mr Riley'), the fifth respondent, Mr David McGregor ('Mr McGregor') and the sixth respondent, Mr Noel Wicks ('Mr Wicks').
The fourth respondent, Ms Maureen Cane ('Ms Cane') joined the Board on 8 April 2000.
At all relevant times:
 
(1) Mr Hutchings Broso was the Managing Director of APIR;
 
(2) Mr Riley was the Technical Director and Company Secretary of APIR; and
 
(3) Mr Hutchings Broso and Mr Riley were the only executive directors of APIR, all other directors being non-executive directors.
Mr Hutchings Broso and Mr Riley are sometimes hereinafter together referred to as 'the executive directors' or 'EDs'.
Initially, Mr Hutchings Broso was the Chairman but was replaced as Chairman by Ms Cane on 27 February 2004.
5 According to its financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2003, APIR had a paid-up capital at that date of $1,118,000 comprising 763,982 fully paid ordinary shares (compared to $939,200 as at 30 June 2002 comprising 686,535 fully paid ordinary shares).
Accumulated trading losses as at 30 June 2003 reduced total equity to $56,439 (compared to $665,399 as at 30 June 2002).
According to the Directors' Report for the year ended 30 June 2003, the principal activity of APIR during that year '... was the development and implementation of electronic commerce infrastructure for the financial services industry'.
6 In this latter respect, the background evidence of its executive directors was not in dispute.
7 Mr Hutchings Broso deposed:
 
 
 '3.
...
Following my retirement [from the Army] in 1993 I provided consultancy services to the government and private enterprise in the Canberra region, relating to communication, particularly in the financial services industry.

 
 
 
 4.
As a part of the consultancy services I was engaged in advising a company that was developing a coding system for participants in the finance industry and the products which they manufacture and sell.
That company went into liquidation in 1997 but as a result of that consultancy I developed specialist knowledge of the company and financial products coding system.
This knowledge combined with my military training meant I had specialist experience on how that coding system was to be used in the market and how information could be formatted, categorised, applied and communicated.
I identified that the business of the company that had gone into liquidation had significant potential value and that a properly funded and well run business utilising the intellectual property of that company would have significant capacity to make substantial in-roads into the industry.
As a result of my opinion I formed a consortium of people who were creditors of the failed company and had a substantial investment in that company by way of unpaid consultancy fees and investment funds and I negotiated with the liquidator of the failed company, Mr Rangott, to purchase the intellectual property of the Asia Pacific Investment Register.
I invested $20,000 and the other investors invested $100,000.
I then formed the company to be known as APIR Systems Pty Ltd. 
 
 
 
 5.
... As the managing director and chairman of APIR, along with Andrew Riley I set about creating a new software program based on intellectual property of the earlier company and in April 1998, with the support of the Investment and Financial Services Association ('IFSA') APIR became the industry standard coding for products and participants in the financial services industry.
That coding provides a unique identifier and is used throughout the industry in reporting and identifying participants and products.
Any analysis in the public media includes the coding system developed by APIR.

 
 
 
 7.
The initial coding purchased from Asia Pacific Investment Register involved 3,000 products that had been transferred as part of the purchase price from the liquidator.
This coding utilised a software approach, APIR quickly developed new software and with the support of IFSA, obtained substantial industry coverage of approximately 7,000 products and participants by the year 2000, and now over 14,000.
The approach of APIR was completely different from the failed company in that the revenue of APIR was derived from a fee for service, rather than an advertising revenue model.
This has resulted in considerable growth in the company revenues, particularly in the last couple of years.
There is considerable scope to market this coding business into emerging economies.

 
 8.
... 
 
 9.
In late 1999 [I] was approached by a group of large financial institutions asking whether APIR could build a system to identify financial advisors and check whether they were compliant with the incoming regulatory regime (the Financial Services Reform Act).
I identified that APIR had the technical expertise and capacity to meet the request but insufficient capital to fund the research and development required to deliver the hardware and software necessary.
I approached AusIndustry on behalf of APIR and sought a grant to enable the development of the solution sought by major industry players.
APIR was successful in obtaining a grant for nearly one million dollars, which was required to be matched dollar for dollar by APIR.
APIR therefore needed to access nearly one million dollars to meet its obligations to AusIndustry.
As a result of this imperative, I began to look around for methods of raising that money.

 
 
 
 10.
I approached a number of potential lenders and investors and whilst those discussions were ongoing, APIR provided its contribution as required by the AusIndustry "R  D Start Grant" from existing working capital and some small loans from existing shareholders and some capital injection.
This process put strain on APIR's cash flow position and there was a need to find a substantial investor.
As a result by mid 2003 I had entered into discussion with 2 potential investors, Mr Charles Gibbon and some time later, Mr David Adams.
...' 
 
 
8 Mr Riley deposed:
 
 
 '7.
APIR is a technology based company and produces a unique identifier code which enables operators within the financial services industry to enable the recognition of information about a particular financial product or participant.
That code is recognized as the industry standard code.
I was a member of the team that helped develop this coding system and I brought that specialised knowledge to APIR when it was set up.
The importance of the APIR coding system to the financial services industry is such that the company must be regarded as being beyond reproach and can't be aligned with any financial service participant.
Because of the industry standard coding system, APIR is privy to Market sensitive information so that APIR can code appropriately a product and issue a code to be used in an information statement or prospectus.
Participants must be assured that the information will be held in confidence and not made available to other participants in the industry.

 
 8.
As the technical director of APIR, I supervise the smooth running of APIR's computer system technology, software development, for the issuing, storing and publishing of code data.
Because the market for financial products is growing, and APIR is increasing its penetration of that market the hardware and software used to develop unique codes is constantly under development.
This development is set against the background of the use of a diverse range of computer systems operated by participants in the Financial Services Industry.
APIR's coding system enables computer systems to recognise the participant and its financial products.

 
 9.
It was apparent to me in October 2002 that APIR needed more capital to enable it to keep abreast of developments and maintain its position as industry standard provider.
I had informal discussions with other directors about the need I perceived for greater investment and the need to raise more working capital.
As a result of those conversations, I, in my role as executive director was asked by the directors to assist in seeking to source more working capital.
Andrew Hutchings Broso was with me whilst those conversations took place.
The directors wanted us both to raise money.
' 
 
 
9 In early 2003, APIR engaged Newport Capital Group Pty Ltd ('Newport Capital') to provide services directed to raising funds for APIR through various financing strategies, including evaluation of such strategies and advice as to the manner in which to structure and implement such financing transactions.
APIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION: THE FIRST HEADS OF AGREEMENT 
 
10 The minutes of a meeting of directors of APIR held on 7 March 2003 record the following:
 'EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S REMUNERATION 
 
 The proposed Heads of Agreement (see Minutes 29/11/02 and 31/1/03) for future remuneration of the Executive Directors was discussed in detail in the context of the progress with Newport Capital Group and consequently to ensure that agreements were in place for continuing management.

 The interests of A Hutchings Broso and A Riley as the Executive Directors were noted.

 It was AGREED to circulate the proposed Heads of Agreement with amendments to be signed off as agreement is reached.

 It was subsequently RESOLVED by separately executed Resolution last date 4 May 2003 that the two Executive Directors each be offered an Agreement for the on-going provision of their services in accordance with the Heads of Agreement now attached.
The commencement date of the Agreements will not be until the receipt of at least $1,000,000.00 from new investors.
' 
 
 

Mr Riley agreed in cross-examination that this minute was prepared shortly after 4 May 2003.
11 The heads of agreement referred to in the minute was embodied in a separate resolution sent to each of the non-executive directors by Mr Riley under cover of a letter bearing date 24 April 2003.
The separate resolution was signed by all directors of APIR, including Mr Hutchings Broso and Mr Riley, between 24 April and 4 May 2003 and is hereafter referred to as 'the first heads of agreement'.
12 The separate resolution provided:
 'EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION It was RESOLVED that the two Executive Directors each be offered an Agreement for the on-going provision of their services in accordance with the Heads of Agreement attached: The commencement date of the Agreements will be that of the receipt of at least $1,000,000.00 from new investors.
HEADS OF AGREEMENT Subject to shareholder approval where required, this Agreement will apply for the Managing Director, Andrew Hutchings Broso, and Andrew Riley as the Executive Directors (each an ED).
The company, "APIR", includes associated companies.
The ED will initially provide his services as defined in the Schedule for a period of two years from the Commencement Date.
The cost of employment of the ED will be in three increments.
From the Commencement Date until the receipt of a further $1M from the capital raising program, the cost of employment will be $120/100 pa. From that date until the receipt of a further $1 M from the capital raising program the cost of employment will be $1 60/140K per annum.
From that date the cost of employment will be $210/175K pa.
In the event that the Board decides not to proceed to raise this further $IM, then the cost of employment will increase to $210/175K on the achievement of revenue from operations of $2M pa.
The Agreement will include a Completion Payment which becomes due at the end of the two year commitment if the company chooses not to continue the EDs.
The Completion Payment will be the greater of $350K or 100,000 times the share price on completion, but will not be payable unless in the opinion of the Board, not acting unreasonably, the company is expected to make a profit from operations and will have the option of making a return to shareholders if so resolved by them.
If APIR chooses to terminate the Agreement before the end of the two year period, then the Completion Payment is payable as a Termination Payment.
If APIR chooses to offer a Continuing Agreement for the provision of services the Completion Payment will be carried forward as an obligation with payment in future tranches or in an equivalent value in shares to be negotiated with the EDs.
The Continuing Agreement would be for an indefinite period, terminable on 6 months Notice or payment in lieu.
A Continuing Agreement would include an annual performance Bonus which may include payment or issue of options or shares.
APIR would have the right of termination for any reason justifying summary dismissal at law.
Each ED will have the choice of providing their services as an employee or as a consultant and of arranging their remuneration packages as they choose, except that the Board may, not acting unreasonably, not approve a proposed arrangement on the grounds of prejudice to the company.
The EDs will be directors of APR but will not receive additional remuneration for this role.
APIR will pay premiums for appropriate DO insurance and indemnify the EDs within the capacity of the company.
The EDs will agree to appropriate clauses on deeding Intellectual Property, on the protection of Confidential Information and for the Restraint of activities to the detriment of APIR both during and after the term of the Agreement.
The EDs will be entitled to reimbursement of expenses, and to take annual leave, sick leave, and parental leave as agreed.
There is no entitlement to be paid out for accumulated sick leave on termination.
In addition to the cost of employment, the EDs will be offered a performance incentive by way of options to purchase shares in the same class as those held by the "foundation shareholder group" (i.e.
the current shareholders on the members register not including those issued $3.50 shares).
The initial opportunity will be on reaching revenue from operations of $2M per annum.
The number of shares will be that required to bring the shareholdings of the EDs in aggregate to 25% of the number of shares held by the "foundation group shareholders".
The shares will be offered to the two EDs on the ratio of .1.2/1.0.
A second opportunity will be on the achievement of an annual net profit of $500,000.
The number of shares will be negotiated.
The exercise price of the Options will be negotiated in good faith.
APIR will arrange finance for the EDs to exercise the options with interest and principle repayment tied to dividend rates and franking credits paid.
The exercise period for taking up the Options will be three years.
There will be allowance for trigger events ie takeover, change of control, joint ventures and splits.
AGREED by: M Cane ................................. A Hutchings Broso ................................. D McGregor ................................. A Riley ................................. N Wicks .................................'
