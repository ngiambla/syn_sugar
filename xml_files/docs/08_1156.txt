 BACKGROUND 
 
 1 On 26 September 2005 the appellant lodged an application for a Skilled --- Independent Overseas Student (Class DD, subclass 880) visa.
In the application she gave her "nominated occupation" as "tradesperson and related worker" and said she had obtained an Advanced Diploma of Information Technology (E-Business Development) from AlphaBeta Colleges.
She paid the required application fee of $1,935.
2 At the time of lodgement of the application the criteria to be satisfied at the time of decision were, in part, as follows:
 
 
 
 880.221 If regulation 2.27B applies, the applicant provides, for the purposes of the application, the assessment of his or her skills mentioned in subregulation 2.27B(4).
880.222 The applicant has the qualifying score when assessed in relation to the visa under Subdivision B of Division 3 of Part 2 of the Act.

 
 
... 
 
 
 880.230 A relevant assessing authority has assessed the skills of the applicant as suitable for his or her nominated skilled occupation.

 
 
 
3 Clause 880.230 was inserted by the Migration Amendment Regulations 2005 (No 3) (Cth) (the 2005 Regulations).
By reg 4(1) (the 2005 transitional provision) this amendment applied to a visa application made on or after 1 July 2005.
4 The appellant had supplied a positive skills assessment to meet the requirement in clause 880.221.
However, by the time her application was assessed by the Minister's delegate, clause 880.230 had been amended to read:
 
 
 (1) A relevant assessing authority has assessed the skills of the applicant as suitable for his or her nominated skilled occupation, and no evidence has become available that the information given or used as part of the assessment of the applicant's skills is false or misleading in a material particular.
(2) If the assessment mentioned in subclause (1) is made on the basis of a qualification obtained in Australia while the applicant was the holder of a student visa, the qualification was obtained as a result of full time study of a registered course.

 
 
The expression "registered course" was defined as:
 a course of education or training provided by an institution, body or person that is registered, under section 9 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, to provide the course to overseas students.
5 The amendments in [4] were made by the Migration Amendment Regulations 2006 (No 4) (Cth) (the 2006 Regulations).
By reg 4(3) (the 2006 transitional provision) the amendments applied in relation to a visa application:
 (a) made but not finally determined (within the meaning of subsection 5(9) of the Migration Act 1958 ) before 1 July 2006; or (b) made on or after 1 July 2006.
6 The course upon which the appellant relied in her visa application was not a "registered course" for the purposes of clause 880.230(2).
7 The application was refused by the Minister's delegate on 14 February 2007.
An application for review by the Migration Review Tribunal was dismissed on the ground that clause 880.230(2) applied and was not satisfied.
MAGISTRATES COURT 
 
8 The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the Tribunal's decision.
Three grounds were propounded.
The first was that either clause 880.230(2) or reg 4(3) of the 2006 Regulations (see [5]) was beyond power because it was ambiguous in its relationship with reg 4 of the 2005 Regulations (see [3]).
The second was that those provisions were laws "with respect to the acquisition of property" which were not "on just terms", contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution .
The third was that they were not authorised by the regulation making powers in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) and were entirely disproportionate to the purposes of the Act.
