He has remained in Australia ever since.
In 1995, he was granted a permanent residency visa.
In 1998, he was convicted in the District Court of Western Australia of three charges of sexual penetration without consent, the offences having been committed in 1996.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for eight years with eligibility for parole.
He was imprisoned in the Acacia Prison in Western Australia.
2 In September 2001, the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs issued Mr Fernando with a notice of intention to cancel Mr Fernando's permanent residency visa.
On 29 November 2001, the then Minister cancelled Mr Fernando's permanent residency visa under the provisions of s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).
3 Mr Fernando challenged the lawfulness of the cancellation of his visa by an application for judicial review made to this Court.
In September 2003, the Federal Court set aside the Minister's decision to cancel Mr Fernando's visa on the grounds that Mr Fernando had not been afforded procedural fairness ( Fernando v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 975).
This was because the Minister had not given Mr Fernando an opportunity to comment on the substance of allegations made in a document, referred to as Annexure L, which were adverse to Mr Fernando.
4 Carr J observed at [60]:
 The information in Annexure L was adverse to the applicant as it related not only to whether he passed the character test but was also relevant to the exercise of the respondent's discretion to allow the applicant to remain in Australia despite having failed the character test.
5 At the hearing before Carr J, the Minister contended that the identity of an informant in respect of the information in Annexure L needed to be protected.
Carr J ordered that Annexure L be placed in an envelope, sealed and not be unsealed until further order.
6 In October 2003, Mr Fernando was released from Acacia Prison on parole.
Shortly before his release from prison, the then Acting Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs cancelled Mr Fernando's permanent residency visa for a second time.
On his release from prison, Mr Fernando was taken into immigration detention.
He remained in immigration detention until he was released on 18 January 2007 in the circumstances set out in the next paragraph.
7 Mr Fernando commenced a proceeding in this Court challenging the lawfulness of the second cancellation decision.
Before that proceeding was determined, the decision of the Federal Court in the case of Sales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1807 ( Sales ) was delivered.
In Sales , the Court held that the visa cancellation decision was unlawful.
On 18 January 2007, following the judgment in Sales , Mr Fernando was released from immigration detention.
He was advised by the then Minister that he was being released because Sales applied to the circumstances of the cancellation of his visa.
On 24 January 2007, the then Minister consented to orders in the proceeding setting aside the visa cancellation decision made in respect of Mr Fernando on the basis that Sales was applicable in relation to the decision to cancel Mr Fernando's visa.
8 By a letter dated 16 April 2007, from an officer of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Fernando was advised that consideration was to be given to whether his visa may be cancelled, and if it was liable to be cancelled, whether it should be cancelled.
The letter was headed "Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation of Your Visa under Subsection 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 ".
