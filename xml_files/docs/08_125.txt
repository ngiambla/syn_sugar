In response to the application, the second respondent filed a submitting appearance on 27 July 2007.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 Mr Green arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom on 4 January 1974 and, as a result of changes brought about by the Migration Reform Act 1994 (Cth), has held a transitional (permanent) visa since 1 September 1994.
3 Mr Green has been convicted of numerous offences since his arrival in Australia.
As a young man, he appeared before the Children's Court on four occasions and was convicted of offences including break and enter, escaping lawful custody, illegal use of a conveyance, gross insubordination, malicious injury and malicious damage.
At 19 years of age, Mr Green was convicted of stealing a motor vehicle and sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, with a non parole period of 6 months.
This was the first occasion on which he was imprisoned.
4 Over subsequent years, Mr Green was convicted of various offences and sentenced on several occasions.
These offences ranged from stealing a toy from a supermarket to armed robbery and possession of a shortened firearm.
5 It is not disputed that Mr Green has had a troubled life.
Apart from recidivism, Mr Green was subjected to domestic physical abuse as a teenager, ceased school after year nine, has lived with and sought to overcome a drug addiction, and for long periods of time has been unable to care for his child due to his repeated imprisonment.
Counsel for Mr Green emphasised that Mr Green is contrite about his misdemeanours, and is attempting to overcome the problems he has faced.
6 On 12 August 2005, the delegate of the Minister determined to cancel Mr Green's visa pursuant to s 501(2) of the Act.
The reasons given by the delegate were as follows:
 
 'I considered all relevant matters including (1) an assessment of the Character Test as defined by s 501(6) of the Migration Act 1958, (2) the Direction under s 499 of that Act and (3) all evidence provided on behalf of/and by Mr Green.

 
 In reaching my decision I concluded that the pattern of his offending over an extended period, the seriousness of Mr Green's crimes, the disruption these crimes have caused others and the expectations of the Australian community outweighed all other considerations above.

 
 In all the circumstances I exercised my discretion to cancel the visa under s 501(2) of the Act.
' 
 

7 Mr Green filed an application for review of this decision in the Tribunal.
The issue before the Tribunal was not whether Mr Green failed to pass the character test in s 501, which Mr Green concedes he does not, but rather whether the discretion in s 501(2) of the Act should be exercised so as not to cancel his visa.
On 19 October 2005, the Tribunal dismissed the application, finding at [111] that "the primary considerations of community protection and expectations outweigh the other considerations in this case".
LEGISLATION AND POLICY 
 
8 Section 501(2) of the Act provides that the Minister may cancel a visa if the visa-holder does not satisfy the Minister that he or she passes the character test contained in s 501(6) of the Act.
Subsections 501(6)(a) and (c) provide that a visa-holder does not pass the character test if he or she has a "substantial criminal record" or, having regard to his or her past and present criminal and general conduct, is not of good character.
Subsections 501(7)(c) and (d) provide that a person has a substantial criminal record if he or she has been sentenced to either a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more, or two or more terms of imprisonment totalling two years or more.
9 Section 499(1) of the Act provides that the Minister may give written directions to a person or body having functions or powers under the Act if the directions are about the performance of those functions or the exercise of those powers.
Section 499(2A) mandates that the relevant person or body (which includes the Tribunal: see Rokobatini v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1238 ; (1999) 90 FCR 583 at 591 (per Katz J)) must comply with such a direction.
The power of the Minister under s 499(1) is limited by s 499(2), which provides that a direction must be consistent with the Act and regulations promulgated pursuant to it.
10 On 23 August 2001, pursuant to s 499(1), the Minister issued Direction No 21 entitled Visa Refusal and Cancellation under section 501 ("the Direction").
Part 2 of the Direction concerns the exercise of the discretion under s 501(2) once a decision has been made that the character test is not satisfied, a matter which is conceded by Mr Green in this case.
Part 2 provides that, when exercising the discretion, "decision-makers must have regard to" three primary considerations, namely, the protection of the Australian community, the expectations of the Australian community and, if relevant, the best interests of any children involved.
Other considerations, which are not "primary considerations" and are not mandatory, include the effects on the visa-holder's family, evidence of rehabilitation, the likelihood of breaching or evading obligations under a legal or other ongoing matter, the duration of the proposed stay in Australia and whether the visa is permanent or temporary.
11 Paragraph 2.5 of the Direction identifies three factors which are relevant to the protection of the Australian community.
They are the seriousness and nature of the conduct, the likelihood of recidivism and whether visa cancellation would provide general deterrence.
12 Of importance to this case is the process laid down by the Direction for considering "the seriousness and the nature of the conduct of a non-citizen".
Paragraph 2.6 outlines what the Minister views as serious offences, and paragraph 2.7 states that the sentence imposed for a crime is an appropriate indicator of the seriousness of the offender's conduct against the community.
Paragraph 2.8 then provides that decision-makers must take into account certain mitigating considerations:
 
 'When exercising discretion, decision-makers must also take the following factors into account as relevant considerations: 
 
 
 
 (a) any relevant factors provided by the non-citizen as mitigating factors ; 
 
 
 
 (b) the offence is not classified as an offence in Australia.
... 
 
 
 
 (c) a lighter sentence would be incurred in Australia for a similar offence; or 
 
 
 
 (d) the non-citizen has been pardoned' 
 
 (Emphasis added.

 THE DECISION BELOW 
 
13 The Tribunal's reasons comprehensively set out at [10]-[76] the chronology of facts and the evidence relevant to this matter.
The Tribunal summarised Mr Green's personal history, detailed his criminal record in Australia since 1978, and described the events leading up to the cancellation of his visa by the Minister and his detention on 16 August 2005.
14 The Tribunal's reasons summarised the evidence led by Mr Green, most of which pertained to Mr Green's explanation of his personal history, how and why he came to possess a criminal record, and also some mitigating circumstances.
His reasons, in short, were that he had led a life of few opportunities, and that he had unfortunately been surrounded by "bad kids, then bad adults".
The Tribunal described Mr Green's time in prison, and noted his evidence which stated that he was not a "vicious outlaw type of criminal", but rather more of the "Robin Hood" type.
The Tribunal also discussed Mr Green's developing drug addiction, and the crimes he committed to support that addiction, as well as the rehabilitation which Mr Green had sought in art and family.
15 The Tribunal found Mr Green's evidence unsatisfactory in certain respects.
It concluded at [53] that although Mr Green's evidence should not "be entirely discarded, his tendency towards exaggeration and opportunistic fabrication dictates a certain caution in evaluating it.
" An observation as to the need for caution in this context does not mean that Mr Green's evidence was rejected out of hand.
16 After making this finding, the Tribunal addressed the psychological and other evidence before it.
Several psychological assessments of Mr Green were before the Tribunal and, although they appeared to "differ in material respects", the Tribunal found at [64]:
 
 'It is difficult to derive much assistance from this part of the evidence, other than to conclude that the applicant has psychological problems, whether produced by drug abuse, incarceration, an unhappy childhood or a combination of all three.
He has not to date been able to shake off anti-social or self-destructive patterns of behaviour but is not a hopeless case.
He could be rehabilitated and his development of his artistic capacities, as well as his [drug rehabilitation] program are positive steps, as is the possibility of employment and of continuing his relationship with [a female friend].
' 
 

17 The Tribunal then summarised other evidence provided by friends and family of Mr Green, which detailed various matters of personal concern, including the likelihood of Mr Green obtaining employment after his release from prison, continuing an intimate relationship with a female friend, and succeeding in an artistic career.
18 Having reviewed the evidence before it, the Tribunal noted at [81]-[82] that Mr Green conceded that he did not pass the character test within s 501(6) of the Act due to his "substantial criminal record" (as defined in s 501(7)), and that the issue for decision was whether to exercise discretion under s 501(2) not to cancel his visa.
19 The Tribunal decided at [111] that "community protection and expectations outweigh the other considerations in this case" and consequently that the decision to cancel Mr Green's visa must be affirmed.
