 
 THE PROCEEDING 
 
1 The Court has two motions before it.
The first is an application by the respondent, the Commonwealth of Australia, for summary dismissal of the proceeding.
The second is an application by the applicant, Mr Peter Spencer, for interlocutory relief.
Since there is considerable overlap in the questions raised by the two applications, they have been heard together.
2 Mr Spencer is the holder of freehold or leasehold title in respect of some sixteen separate contiguous parcels of land that together comprise the property known as " Saarahnlee ", situated at Shannons Flat in New South Wales.
He says that the effect of the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 (NSW) ( the 1997 Vegetation Act ) and the Native Vegetation Act 2003 (NSW) ( the 2003 Vegetation Act ) (together the State Statutes ) has been to impose a prohibition or general restriction on the reasonable use of Saarahnlee, with the consequence that certain of his interests in Saarahnlee have been expropriated or acquired.
3 Mr Spencer claims that that expropriation or acquisition was effected or authorised by the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992 (Cth) ( the Financial Assistance Act ) and the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997 (Cth) ( the Natural Heritage Act ) (together the Commonwealth Statutes ).
He says that, therefore, they are laws with respect to the acquisition of property.
However, because they do not provide for just terms, they are not authorised by s 51(xxxi) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (Imp) ( the Constitution ).
He says that therefore they are both invalid in so far as they effect or authorise an acquisition of his property.
