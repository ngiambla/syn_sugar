 
1 The Court has three applications before it.
They have been heard together.
Two separate proceedings are involved, although the parties in each proceeding are the same.
Bradken Resources Pty Limited ( Bradken ) is the applicant in both and Lynx Engineering Consultants Pty Limited ( Lynx ) is the respondent in both.
Both proceedings are concerned with Australian Patent Application Number 749848 for an invention titled "Side Reinforced Bulk Material Transport Container" ( the Patent Application ).
The Patent Application was lodged by Lynx.
2 Proceeding NSD 439 of 2007 ( the Appeal Proceeding ) is an appeal by Bradken from part of a decision of a delegate of the Commissioner of Patents ( the Commissioner ) to reject the opposition to the Patent Application filed by Bradken.
Lynx has filed a cross-appeal in the Appeal Proceeding.
3 Proceeding NSD 2461 of 2007 ( the Threats Proceeding ) is a claim by Bradken that a letter of 11 October 2007 ( the Threats Letter ) to BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Limited ( BHP ) constitutes unjustifiable threats by Lynx within s 128 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ( the 1990 Act ).
The Threats Letter was written by Watermark Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys acting for Lynx.
4 Prior to the commencement of both the Appeal Proceeding and the Threats Proceeding, Lynx had commenced proceedings numbers WAD 219 of 2006 and WAD 217 of 2007 in the Western Australia Registry of the Court.
On 13 February 2008, those proceedings were consolidated by order of the Court ( the Confidential Information Proceeding ).
The respondents in the Confidential Information Proceeding are ANI Corporation Limited, trading as "ANI Bradken Rail Transportation Group" ( ANI ), Bradken, Bradken Limited and WorleyParsons Services Pty Limited ( WorleyParsons ).
5 It appears to be undisputed that it would be desirable for the Appeal Proceeding and the Threats Proceeding to be managed together, since the outcome of the Appeal Proceeding could have a bearing on issues in the Threats Proceedings.
However, Lynx has applied in each of the Appeal Proceeding and the Threats Proceeding for an order that each proceeding be transferred to the Western Australia Registry and that, when transferred, it be managed together with the Confidential Information Proceeding.
6 Bradken, in its turn, has applied for orders striking out certain paragraphs of the Defence filed by Lynx in the Threats Proceeding.
In the Defence, Lynx relies, inter alia , on s 129(b) and 57 of the 1990 Act.
However, Lynx also alleges in the Defence that Bradken should be denied relief by reason of the conduct that it alleges against Bradken in the Confidential Information Proceeding.
7 It is desirable to say something about the provisions of the 1990 Act that are relevant to the Threats Proceeding.
I shall then say something about each of the three proceedings in order to place in context the issues raised by the three applications presently before the Court.
STATUTORY CONTEXT 
 
8 Sections 57, 128 and 129 of the 1990 Act are of particular importance in the present context.
However, I shall first say something about the regime for public inspection of documents relevant to a patent application.
That regime is relevant to one of the questions raised by the strike out motion.
9 Under s 29(1) of the 1990 Act, a person may apply for a patent by filing a patent request.
Section 49(1) provides that the Commissioner must accept a patent request and complete specification relating to an application for a patent if certain prerequisites are satisfied.
Under s 49(5)(b), where the Commissioner accepts a patent request and a complete specification, the Commissioner must publish a notice of the acceptance in the Official Journal .
10 Under s 53 of the 1990 Act, where a patent application is made, the Commissioner must publish prescribed information about the applicant and the application.
Section 54(1) provides that, where a complete specification filed in respect of an application has not become open to public inspection, the Commissioner must , if asked to do so by the applicant, publish a notice that the complete specification is open to public inspection.
Under s 54(3), where a complete specification has been filed in respect of an application, the prescribed period has ended and the specification is not open to public inspection, the Commissioner must publish a notice that the specification is open to public inspection.
11 Section 55(1) then provides that, where a notice is published under s 54, the specification concerned and other prescribed documents are open to public inspection.
Section 55(2) provides that, where a notice is published under s 49(5)(b) in relation to an application, the documents specified in s 55(2) that have not already become open to public inspection become open to public inspection.
Under s 56, except as otherwise provided by the Act, documents of the kind mentioned in s 55 must not be published or be open to public inspection.
12 Section 57(1) provides that, after a complete specification relating to an application has become open to public inspection, and until a patent is granted on the application, the applicant has the same rights as he or she would have had if a patent for the invention had been granted on the day when the specification became open to public inspection.
However, s 57(3) provides that s 57(1) does not give the applicant a right to start proceedings in respect of the doing of an act unless:
 
(a) a patent is granted on the application; and
 
(b) the act would, if done after the grant of the patent, have constituted an infringement of a claim of the specification.
13 Section 128(1) provides that, where a person threatens a person with infringement proceedings, or other similar proceedings, a person aggrieved may apply for:
 
(a) a declaration that the threats are unjustifiable; and
 
(b) an injunction against the continuance of the threats; and
 
(c) the recovery of any damages sustained by the applicant as a result of the threats.
14 Section 129 relevantly provides that the Court may grant the applicant the relief applied for under s 128, unless the respondent satisfies the Court that the acts about which the threats were made infringed, or would infringe:
 
(a) a claim that is not shown by the applicant to be invalid; or
 
(b) rights under s 57 in respect of a claim that is not shown by the applicant to be a claim that would be invalid if the patent had been granted.
The reference to a claim in paragraphs (a) and (b) is a reference to a claim of a standard patent or application for a standard patent.
15 Section 130(1) of the 1990 Act provides that the respondent in proceedings under s 128 may apply, by way of counter-claim, for relief to which the respondent would be entitled in separate proceedings for an infringement by the applicant of the patent to which the threats relate.
Section 130(2) permits the applicant to apply in the proceedings, after the respondent has applied by way of counter-claim, for the revocation of the Patent.
The provisions of the Act relating respectively to infringement proceedings and revocation of a patent apply mutatis mutandis to such proceedings.
THE PATENT APPLICATION AND THE APPEAL PROCEEDING 
 
16 The Patent Application was lodged on 30 March 1999 and became open to public inspection on and from 16 December 1999.
The Commissioner accepted the Patent Application on 4 July 2002.
17 On 4 October 2002, Bradken filed a Notice of Opposition to the grant of a patent pursuant to the Patent Application.
On 13 March 2007 a delegate of the Commissioner made a decision that the opposition did not succeed except in relation to certain claims.
The delegate directed that Lynx be given leave to file amendments in relation to those claims.
The Appeal Proceeding was brought by Bradken in respect of that decision.
18 On 11 May 2007, Lynx filed amendments to the Patent Application pursuant to the leave given by the delegate ( the Lynx Amendments ).
On 16 July 2007, Bradken filed submissions in relation to the Lynx Amendments.
However, notice of acceptance of the Lynx Amendments was published on 1 November 2007.
On 31 January 2008, Bradken filed an opposition to the Lynx Amendments.
THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION PROCEEDING 
 
19 In the Confidential Information Proceeding, Lynx claims a declaration that ANI, Bradken and Bradken Limited have infringed the copyright of Lynx in various drawings and materials containing technical specifications and other manufacturing details ( the Lynx Copyright Works) .
Lynx also claims a declaration that those three respondents have breached a duty of confidence owed to Lynx in respect of the Lynx Copyright Works on the basis that the information contained in the Lynx Copyright Works is unpublished confidential information of Lynx ( the Lynx Confidential Information ).
Lynx further claims a declaration that the respondents have engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct under ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( the Trade Practices Act ).
Lynx also claims consequential relief in respect of the alleged infringement of copyright, breach of duty of confidence and misleading and deceptive conduct.
20 Lynx alleges that Bradken used, and procured and joined in the use of, the Lynx Confidential Information knowingly to manufacture, or join in and procure the manufacture of, railway wagons that are the subject of the claimed invention of the Patent Application and to market such wagons and sell them or offer them for sale.
Lynx asserts that, by doing so, Bradken achieved a head start in relation to the manufacture, offering for sale, marketing and sale of such wagons because it avoided the need for independent design, development, marketing and manufacture.
Lynx alleges that products designed, developed, marketed and manufactured by Bradken involve the use of the Lynx Confidential Information in breach of contractual and equitable obligations of confidence.
THE THREATS PROCEEDING 
 
21 In the threats proceeding, Bradken claims an order restraining Lynx from representing that the Patent Application permits it to sue any third party for infringement of a patent and from representing that Lynx has an expectation that the Patent Application will proceed to grant and that thereupon it will obtain rights to sue any third party for infringement of a patent.
Bradken also claims damages pursuant to s 129 of the 1990 Act.
