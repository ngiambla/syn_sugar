 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The appellant, a citizen of Indonesia, was born on 11 December 1956.
She arrived in Australia on 22 June 1982 as a student.
On 13 February 2001, she applied for a protection visa pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the "Act").
On 28 March 2002 a delegate (the "Delegate) of the first respondent (the "Minister") declined the application, which decision was affirmed by the second respondent (the "Tribunal") on 1 July 2003.
The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.
She was unsuccessful but, on 9 March 2006, Bennett J allowed an appeal from the Magistrate's decision, set aside the Tribunal's decision and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for further consideration.
On 5 September 2006 the Tribunal again upheld the Delegate's decision.
The appellant again applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of that decision.
On 1 February 2008 a Federal Magistrate (the "Magistrate") dismissed that application.
This is an appeal from that decision.
2 The appellant was born in Surabaya in East Java.
She speaks, reads and writes Indonesian, English and Dutch.
She is of Chinese extraction and is a Roman Catholic.
Prior to coming to Australia she was a housekeeper.
She claims to have qualifications in accounting, commerce and secretarial work.
She entered Australia as an overseas private student and, until 1992, remained here in that capacity.
She then decided to remain permanently, notwithstanding expiry of her visa.
