 
1 Mr Frank Anton is a self-employed builder and handyman who usually undertakes small renovations and maintenance jobs in and around his hometown of Hamilton in Western Victoria.
Between May 2005 and late 2006 or early 2007, Mr Anton performed work on a project called the Iluka Murray Basin Development Project.
The project included the construction of two plants.
The first was a mineral sands separation plant at Hamilton ("the Hamilton site") and the second was a mine unit and wet concrete plant at nearby Douglas.
2 This proceeding arose as a consequence of the interaction by Mr Anton with workers on the Hamilton site who were members of the first respondent, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("the CFMEU").
The applicant, Mr Cruse, is a workplace inspector under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act ") and an Australian Building and Construction Commissioner under the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("the BCII Act ").
He is entitled to bring this proceeding.
3 Mr Cruse alleges that, in May 2005, the fourth respondent, Mr Fry, contravened s 298SC of the pre-Reform WR Act by making a false or misleading representation to Mr Anton about Mr Anton's obligation to join the CFMEU.
Mr Fry was employed at the Hamilton site and was a delegate of the CFMEU at that site at all material times.
4 Mr Cruse also alleges that Mr Fry breached s 170NC of the pre-Reform WR Act by taking action with intent to coerce Mr Anton to agree to make an enterprise bargaining agreement with the CFMEU.
5 The second and third respondents, Mr Bannister and Mr Hoffman were employed at the Hamilton site at all material times.
It is not in dispute that Mr Bannister was also a delegate of the CFMEU, but whether Mr Hoffman was such a delegate is in dispute.
As it transpires, it is not necessary to resolve that dispute.
