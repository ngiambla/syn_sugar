 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The second respondent (Lilly) is registered as proprietor of Australian Patent No 565856 entitled "difluro nucleoside antivirals".
Lilly is also the patentee of the Austrian equivalent of the Australian Patent.
The second cross claimant is the exclusive licensee of the Patent in Australia.
2 On 14 January 2000 the Commissioner of Patents granted an extension of term of the Patent for a period of five years ending 7 March 2009.
On 19 March 2008 the applicant commenced proceedings seeking, amongst other things:
 
(a) an order setting aside the Commissioner's decision to extend the term of the Patent (ss 5 , 15 and 16 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (ADJR Act) and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth));
 
(b) an order rectifying the Register of Patents by removing all references to any extended term of the Patent (s 192 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth));
 
(c) an order revoking the Patent (s 138(1) of the Patents Act );
 
(d) damages pursuant to ss 52 , 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
3 On 12 May 2008 Lilly and the second cross claimant filed a cross claim alleging infringement of the Patent.
4 The Patent describes and discloses a class of compounds which have an anti-viral therapeutic effect.
The invention described and claimed in the complete specification is a class of compounds being antiviral nucleosides for the treatment of viral infections.
5 In its application for an extension of the term of the Patent, Lilly relied upon registrations on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) for the commercial product Gemcitabine hydrochloride.
The registrations state that the approved indication for Gemcitabine hydrochloride is:
 
(a) treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer, and
 
(b) from 4 July 1997, treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small lung cancer, locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and 5-FV refractory pancreatic cancer.
6 The applicant claims there is a disconformity between the pharmaceutical substance with the indication described in the ARTG registrations and the class of antiviral compounds described and claimed in the specification.
This perceived disconformity forms the basis for its application to review the extension of the term and revoke the Patent for lack of fair basis and false suggestion, the Trade Practices Act claim, and its defence to the infringement action pursuant to s 78 of the Patents Act .
THE TWO MOTIONS 
 
7 Before me are two motions.
The first, by Lilly, seeks an order under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that pars 1 to 6, 8 and 10 of the Amended Application, and pars 7 to 19 of the Amended Statement of Claim be dismissed.
The second, by the applicant, seeks leave to amend its Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim.
8 Section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act is in part as follows:
 
 
 (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.

 
 
 
 
 (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be:
 (a) hopeless; or 
 
 (b) bound to fail; for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.
9 Lindgren J has recently collected the cases on the meaning and effect of s 31A and comparable provisions: White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [58] - [59] , where he considered the test to be whether there are "real" as opposed to "fanciful" or "merely arguable" prospects.
10 Lilly's motion gives rise to three issues.
The first is the viability of the applicant's claim to relief under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act .
The second is whether the applicant has standing to claim relief under the ADJR Act, s 192 of the Patents Act and s 39B of the Judiciary Act .
The third is whether, assuming it has standing, it should be denied relief because of its delay.
In a s 31A context, in each case the question is whether the Court is satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the applicant succeeding in the relevant claim or issue.
TRADE PRACTICES ACT 
 
11 The applicant alleges that in applying for an extension of the term of the Patent, Lilly represented to the first respondent (the Commissioner) that the pharmaceutical substance on the ARTG on which it relied was disclosed in claims 1 to 4 and 6 of the Patent.
The applicant alleges that these representations were made in trade and commerce and were false.
12 In Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75 the applicant alleged that Novopharm, in trade or commerce, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent.
At [32] to [33] Lindgren J said:
 The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novopharm to the APO ... were not made in trade or commerce.
They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novopharm on the one hand, and ... the APO ... on the other hand.
Novopharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO ....
Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts ....
The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation.
No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novopharm in trade or commerce in a broad non-s 52 sense.
However, in Concrete Constructions the High Court ... rejected the view that the expression 'in trade or commerce' in s 52 referred to the 'immense field of activities' in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on some overall trading or commercial business .... 
13 The course of authority to which Lindgren J referred consisted of Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 , Village Building Co Ltd v Canberra International Airport (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 ; (2004) 134 FCR 422 at [57] - [58] , affirmed on appeal at [2004] FCAFC 240 ; (2004) 139 FCR 330 at [50] - [55] , and RGC Mineral Sands Ltd v Wimmera Industrial Minerals Pty Ltd (No 2) [2000] FCA 22.
14 The applicant sought to distinguish the present case from Glueck on the ground that the facts of the two cases were different.
That is true, but the proposition derived by Lindgren J from the authorities referred to is applicable here.
Essentially that is because of the passage in Concrete Constructions at 604, upon which Glueck was based, in which it was said:
 What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it ... has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character.
It is that relationship that is absent here.
I am not persuaded that Glueck is plainly wrong, and accordingly I should follow it.
15 The applicant filed material that bore on the activities of the Patent Office.
However, no reliance was placed on it in the applicant's counsel's submissions, and Lilly's counsel made no reference to it.
I have not carried out my own investigation as to what might have been made of the material.
16 In my opinion the applicant has no reasonable prospect of succeeding in its s 52 claim.
STANDING 
 
17 Section 5 of the ADJR Act enables a "person aggrieved" by a decision to which the Act applies to seek an order of review.
Section 192(1) of the Patents Act enables a "person aggrieved" by, amongst other things, an entry wrongly existing in the Register of Patents, to apply for an order to rectify the Register.
Section 39B of the Judiciary Act does not use the expression "person aggrieved".
It was, however, common ground that if the applicant was not a "person aggrieved" under s 5 of the ADJR Act or s 192, it would lack standing under s 39B.
18 In Assa Abloy Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Lock Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 246 ; (2005) 68 IPR 105 at [19] the Full Court referred to the observations of McLelland J in a trade mark context in Ritz Hotel Ltd v Charles of the Ritz Ltd (1988) 15 NSWLR 158 at 193 ( Ritz ), and said:
 [Adapting] that language to the design context, the expression would embrace any person having a real interest in having the entry expunged and thus would include any person who would be or in respect of whom there is a reasonable possibility of his or her being 'appreciably disadvantaged in a legal or practical sense' by the entry not being expunged.
