 
1 I have before me three applications relating to access to material on the Court's file, including affidavits.
Some of the material is in evidence and some of it is not.
Argument in relation to the three applications, including written submissions, was completed on 20 August 2008, when I indicated the conclusions that I had reached in relation to most, but not all, of the material in dispute.
On 21 August 2008, I made orders giving effect to those conclusions but reserved my decision in relation to some of the material in dispute.
I have now reached a final conclusion in relation to all of the material in dispute.
My conclusions and the reasons for them follow.
2 The applications are concerned with s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( the Federal Court Act ) and Order 46 Rule 6 of the Federal Court Rules .
Section 50 relevantly provides that the Court may make such order forbidding or restricting the publication of particular evidence, or the name of a party, as appears to the Court to be necessary in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice .
Order 46 r 6(1) of the Federal Court Rules provides that a person may search in the Registry for, and inspect, documents specified in r 6(2).
Subject to an exception not presently relevant, affidavits are not specified in r 6(2).
Rather, r 6(3) specifically provides that, except with the leave of the Court or a judge, a person who is not a party to a proceeding must not inspect an affidavit.
THE PROCEEDING 
 
3 The first respondent, the Australian Crime Commission ( the Commission ), is conducting a special investigation pursuant to a determination made by its Board under s 7C of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) ( the Commission Act ).
By notice dated 30 September 2005 ( the Notice ), issued pursuant to s 29 of the Commission Act, an international accounting firm with an office in Sydney ( the Accountants ) was required to produce, to an officer of the Commission, documents described in the schedule to the Notice.
The schedule referred to documents pertaining to a number of individuals and entities, including the present applicant.
The Accountants produced a number of documents to the Commission in compliance with the Notice.
4 The Notice contained a notation, pursuant to s 29A of the Commission Act, that prohibited the Accountants from disclosing the existence of the Notice or any official matter connected with it.
However, the notation was subsequently varied to allow the Accountants to disclose the existence of the Notice to the applicant.
The present proceeding was instituted in early 2006, after the applicant became aware that the Notice had been issued to the Accountants.
5 A claim to legal professional privilege on the part of the present applicant was made in respect of a number of the documents produced to the Commission.
The basis of that claim was that each of the disputed documents was prepared, or evidenced, a communication made, for the dominant purpose of the giving of instructions for, or the obtaining of, legal advice, or the provision of legal services, for or on behalf the applicant.
Instructions for such advice were given by an individual ( the Consultant ) and the advice was furnished to the Consultant.
The Consultant was originally the applicant in the proceeding.
6 The Commission disputed that the documents were prepared for, or evidenced communications made for, the purposes described above.
The Commission also contended that, even if the documents were prepared for or evidenced communications made for those purposes, there were reasonable grounds for believing that any such communications were made in the furtherance of fraud or the commission of an offence, such that legal professional privilege did not attach to any of the documents in dispute.
7 When the proceeding was originally commenced, the Consultant was referred to by the pseudonym " A3 ".
Subsequently, the present applicant, who has been referred to by the pseudonym " P ", was joined as an applicant and, later, the Consultant was removed as an applicant.
Orders were made by the Court relieving both the Consultant and the applicant from compliance with Order 4 rule 4(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules , on the basis that sealed envelopes, marked "NOT TO BE OPENED UNTIL FURTHER ORDER OF THE COURT" and containing the respective names and addresses of the Consultant and the applicant, would be filed with the Court.
The Court also ordered, pursuant to s 50, that publication of the names and addresses of the Consultant and the applicant be forbidden and that, until further order, the Consultant and the applicant be referred to respectively by the pseudonyms.
In addition, in the course of the proceeding, orders were also made under s 50 concerning parts of certain affidavits filed and read in the proceeding and certain of the documents admitted into evidence in the proceeding.
8 The course described above was adopted with the consent, and in some instances, at the behest, of the Commission.
A principal reason why that course was adopted was the concern expressed by the Commission that disclosure of names and other documents issued by the Commission in relation to its special investigation could prejudice the effectiveness of that investigation (see C v Australian Crime Commission [2005] FCA 1736).
9 After hearing the applicant and the respondents and after examining the documents in dispute, I concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, save for minor exceptions, the documents in dispute are documents brought into existence for the predominant purpose of either requesting or providing legal advice in relation to the affairs of the applicant.
For the greater part, that advice concerned matters of taxation in either Australia or the United States.
I concluded that the advice could not fairly be characterised as mere accounting or taxation advice, in the sense of expressing opinions concerning accounting treatment or accounting records.
Rather, the advice in question could fairly be characterised as legal advice in relation to certain taxation consequences of proposed action on the part of the present applicant (see A3 v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2006] FCA 929).
10 The Commissioner has now abandoned its contention as to fraud or the commission of an offence.
The documents that are the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege are therefore to be returned to the applicant.
However, before final disposition of the proceeding, the present three applications were made.
