 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 20 August 2008 I made certain orders following a review of the decision and orders of a Deputy Registrar.
These are my reasons for the making of those orders.
2 On 27 June 2008 the Deputy Registrar ordered that the defendant (the Company) be wound up and that Anthony Sims of Sims Partners be appointed liquidator.
The Deputy Registrar also ordered that the costs of the plaintiff (DCT --- I will also use the abbreviation "ATO" to refer to the Australian Taxation Office) be fixed at $1,256.70 and be reimbursed pursuant to s 566 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).
3 The Deputy Registrar noted by consent that the Company had not had the leave of the Court under s 490(1) of the Act when, on 19 May 2008, it had resolved to be wound up voluntarily and appointed the present applicant, Murray Roderick Godfrey (Mr Godfrey), as voluntary liquidator, and that his appointment as liquidator was invalid.
4 The Deputy Registrar also ordered that Mr Godfrey's costs on an interlocutory process that he had filed on 27 June 2008 be fixed at $1,200.00 and be reimbursed next after the DCT's costs.
