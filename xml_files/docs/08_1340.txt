 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 20 August 2008 I made the orders which appear at the front of these reasons for judgment.
These are the reasons why I made those orders.
2 On 21 April 2008 the second defendant (the Company) appointed the first defendants (the Administrators) joint and several administrators of the Company in exercise of the power given to the Company by s 436A(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).
The resolution to exercise that power was passed by the sole director and secretary of the Company, the third defendant (Samantha Leonie --- I adopt this form of reference to distinguish her from two other persons with the surname Williams mentioned below, and without intending any discourtesy).
3 The Administrators furnished their report to creditors on 19 May 2008.
At the second meeting of creditors held on 27 May 2008, the creditors resolved, on the recommendation of the Administrators, that the Company execute a deed of company arrangement in the form presented to the meeting (DOCA).
Under the DOCA, Samantha Leonie paid $120,000 to the Administrators which, after payment of the Administrators' remuneration and expenses, was to be distributed among creditors.
This would give unsecured creditors a dividend of approximately eight cents in the dollar.
4 According to the Administrators' report, the two major unsecured creditors were the plaintiff (Johnson) which was owed $527,767.00, and the "Hughes Family Trust" which was owed $782,346.05.
As will appear, there is an association between the Hughes Family Trust and the Williams family.
Another creditor, Christine Margot Williams (Christine Margot), the mother of Samantha Leonie, was owed $1,000.00.
Christine Margot works for "Northstar Accountants" which, according to the Administrators' report, was owed $6,325.00.
5 At the second creditors' meeting, Samantha Leonie held a proxy from her mother.
Grant Hughes of GTH Pty Ltd as trustee for the Hughes Family Trust was proxy for that Trust and also for Paddle Sports Australia Pty Ltd which was shown in the Administrators' report as being owed $37,018.00.
Grant Hughes was also proxy for Northstar Accountants.
The resolution in favour of the Company's executing the DOCA was carried on votes cast by Mr Hughes and Samantha Leonie over the opposition of Christopher Thompson, the proxy for Johnson.
6 Johnson now applies under s 445D of the Act for an order terminating the DOCA.
While Johnson makes no criticism of the Administrators, its case is that they were misled by others into providing a report that contained material information that was false or misleading and omitted material information.
Johnson's case rests on paras (a), (b) and (c) of s 445D(1) of the Act:
 The Court may make an order terminating a deed of company arrangement if satisfied that: 
 
 (a) information about the company's business, property, affairs or financial circumstances that:
 (i) was false or misleading; and 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) can reasonably be expected to have been material to creditors of the company in deciding whether to vote in favour of the resolution that the company execute the deed;
 was given to the administrator of the company or to such creditors; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) such information was contained in a report or statement under subsection 439A(4) that accompanied a notice of the meeting at which the resolution was passed; or
 (c) there was an omission from such a report or statement and the omission can reasonably be expected to have been material to such creditors in so deciding; ... 
 

7 There is reason to be suspicious about certain dispositions that have been made of the Company's property.
I have reached the conclusion that the Company should be wound up and that a liquidator nominated by Johnson should be appointed.
The Administrators do not oppose the making of such orders.
They properly take the position that the matter is one for the Court.
They point out, however, that there would be some saving in costs if they were appointed rather than Johnson's nominee.
8 Samantha Leonie is taken to have been served with the originating process pursuant to an order that I made for substituted service.
She did not appear on the hearing.
FACTS 
 
9 The following is an outline of the facts in chronological sequence.
10 On 29 November 2002, the Company was incorporated as "Johnson Outdoors Watercraft Pty Ltd" (on 6 July 2004 the Company changed its name to its present name, "Canoe Sports Pty Limited").
Upon incorporation, Samantha Leonie was appointed as a director of the Company, and her mother Christine Margot was appointed as both a director and secretary of the Company.
11 On 1 May 2003, a "Canoe Sports Unit Trust" was created by a Unit Trust Deed of that date.
According to Samantha Leonie, in May 2003, the Company purchased its present business, including stock at the time, from the Hughes Family Trust for a price of $1,274,508.
Apparently 400,000 units in the Canoe Sports Unit Trust were issued to the Hughes Family trust, and 200,000 units were issued to the "Williams Family Trust".
12 On 1 June 2004, the Company and Johnson entered into a Distribution Agreement with effect as from July 2004.
Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company purchased goods from time to time from Johnson.
13 On 5 July 2004, Tina Williams (Tina), the sister of Samantha Leonie, was appointed as both a third director and secretary of the Company.
As mentioned earlier, it was on the following day, 6 July 2004, that the Company changed its name.
14 On 16 May 2005, Tina resigned as a director and secretary.
Accordingly, Tina was a director for only some ten months from July 2004 to May 2005.
15 In July 2005, the 400,000 units in the Canoe Sports Unit Trust that were apparently issued to the Hughes Family Trust were redeemed.
At the same time, the 200,000 units apparently issued to the Williams Family Trust were redeemed.
In a further report to creditors dated 15 July 2008, the Administrators stated that the redemption was by way of issued capital and increase in liabilities, essentially turning the units into loan account.
16 On 24 August 2005, Christine Margot purchased a property at 28 Ocean View Drive, Wamberal, and Johnson contends that she used money of the Company for the purpose.
17 On 10 February 2006, Samantha Leonie purchased a commercial property at 6/260 Captain Cook Drive, Kurnell, and Johnson contends that she used Company money for the purpose.
18 On 21 November 2006, Johnson terminated the Distribution Agreement between it and the Company.
Samantha Leonie has informed the Administrators that the Company has not purchased any new stock since the termination.
According to the report of the Administrators, by November 2006 the Company was insolvent.
19 On 30 November 2006, Samantha Leonie and Christine Margot, as directors of the Company caused the Company to pay $805,875.12 to the Williams Family Trust ($310,000) and the "Monowatu Family Trust" ($495,875.12).
Both of those trusts are associated with members of the Williams Family.
20 On 17 January 2007, that is to say, not long after the money had gone from the Company, Christine Margot resigned as a director and secretary of the Company, leaving Samantha Leonie as the sole director.
Samantha Leonie was appointed secretary of the Company on that same day.
21 On 27 February 2007, Tina caused Kayak Wholesalers Pty Ltd, known from 11 July 2007 as Bengal Distribution Pty Ltd, to be incorporated with the same registered address as that of the Company.
22 In March 2007, the Company ceased trading.
23 On 8 March 2007, a "loan" to the Monowatu Trust was "discharged" but according to the Administrators' report, the Monowatu Trust was overpaid $294,038.88, that is to say, the Monowatu Trust was paid that amount over and above the amount of the debt owed to it.
24 On 16 March 2007, Samantha Leonie sent an email using Tina's email address to a customer suggesting that claims that the business had ceased were false and that in fact she and her sister Tina were still in business and intended to continue to trade through a newly established entity --- no doubt a reference to Kayak Wholesalers Pty Ltd.
 
25 On 26 March 2007 Grant Hughes caused Paddle Sports Australia Pty Ltd to be incorporated.
26 On 13 August 2007, Johnson filed a statement of claim in the District Court of New South Wales, commencing proceeding No 3478/07 in that Court.
It is not necessary to trace the course of that proceeding: it suffices to say that on 22 January 2008 judgment was entered in favour of Johnson for $NZD567,000.
27 On 6 February 2008, Samantha Leonie sold a property at 18 Heath Street, Mona Vale for $1,620,000.
28 On 7 February 2008, a Judicial Registrar gave Johnson leave to enter judgment against the Company for AUD 527,767.55 plus costs to be assessed.
The Company was required to provide security of $400,000 within 28 days as a condition of obtaining a continuance of a stay of execution of the judgment to enable the Company to pursue a cross-claim against Johnson, but the security of $400,000 was not provided.
29 On 28 March 2008, Christine Margot mortgaged the adjoining property at 16 Heath Street, Mona Vale to secure financial accommodation of $243,000.
30 As noted earlier, on 21 April 2008, the Company entered into voluntary administration.
31 On 23 April 2008, Johnson furnished a completed proof of debt to the Administrators for the amount of its judgment debt.
32 On 28 April 2008, Samantha Leonie furnished a Report as to Affairs (RATA) showing that the Company had assets of an estimated realisable value of $1,269 (cash at bank) and unsecured creditors totalling $1,247,195 as follows (excluding interest):
 Johnson $527,767 Northstar Accountants 6,325 Paddle Sports Australia Pty Ltd 37,018 Crisp Legal 447 Christine Margot 1,000 Hughes Family Trust 671,882 Australian Taxation Office 2,756 
 _________
$1,247,195
======== 
Between the appointment of the Administrators and the issue of their report, the Administrators concluded that the amount owed by the Company to the Hughes Family Trust was in fact $782,346.05, the amount for which the Trust had lodged a proof of debt.
33 On 2 May 2008, the first meeting of creditors was held.
34 On 19 May 2008, the Administrators gave notice of the second meeting of creditors to be held on 27 May 2008, accompanied by their report to creditors.
35 On 27 May 2008 the creditors resolved, over the dissenting vote of Johnson, that the Company execute the DOCA.
