 
1 I have a further application made this afternoon in relation to the question of costs of the appeal.
The order of the Court is that the appellant shall pay the costs of the first respondent of and incidental to the appeal.
The present application seeks to quantify those costs in an amount.
An affidavit of Nicola Johnson sworn 25 August 2008 is read in support of the application for costs fixed in an amount.
Having considered the content of that affidavit, I order that the costs, the subject of order 2 of the orders published today, be fixed in the amount of $1,900.00.
I certify that the preceding one (1) numbered paragraph is a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.
