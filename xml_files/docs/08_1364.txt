 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This matter arises from the sale of two citrus orchards and a Packing Shed in southeast Queensland, near the towns of Bundaberg and Tiaro, in 2005, by the first respondent to the first applicant.
The primary proceedings involve a claim by the applicants, seeking relief against the respondents in respect of conduct in breach of ss 51A, 52 , and 53A Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ").
2 The first respondent is a corporation alleged by the applicants to have engaged in the impugned conduct.
The second and third respondents are individuals alleged by the applicants to have, inter alia , aided and abetted the first respondent in engaging in that conduct.
There is also a secondary claim in the nature of a cross-claim by the first respondent against the first applicant in the sum of $385,383 for loss suffered by the first respondent upon the failure of the first applicant to complete the contract for purchase of the Packing Shed, in the sum of $150,000 for a loan which remains due and owing by the first applicant to the first respondent, and interest on those sums under s 51A Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
The success of this cross-claim is dependent upon the outcome of the primary proceedings.

4 The hearing in this matter took place over twelve months, and resulted in the parties tendering a substantial amount of material as evidence.
As is common in proceedings involving claims pursuant to Part V of the Act , the success or otherwise of the applicants' claim turns on the facts before the Court.
For this reason, it is appropriate before moving on to a more detailed consideration of the claims of the applicants to outline the background facts.
BACKGROUND 
 The parties 
 
5 The applicants in these proceedings are the first applicant, Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd; the second applicant, Mr Peter Michael Tracy; and the third applicant, Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd.
 
6 At all material times the first applicant was a company duly incorporated according to law, was the sole shareholder in the third applicant, and was the trustee of the Sunstate Orchards Unit Trust.
7 The second applicant, Mr Tracy, was at all material times the sole director and shareholder of the first applicant, and the sole director of the third applicant.
In his statement of 17 November 2006, Mr Tracy said that he held tertiary qualifications, namely an Associate Diploma of Arts, a Post Graduate Diploma of Management, and a Masters of Business Administration.
Mr Tracy also stated that his work experience was primarily in human resource management with particular emphasis on the mining industry, and that he had no experience, either professional or practical, concerning the citrus or horticultural industries.
However it became apparent during cross-examination of Mr Tracy that he was also a director and principal of a company known as The RT Group Pty Ltd, which specialised in assisting the small to medium sector with business turnaround and management techniques (exhibit R21).
Under cross-examination from Mr Bell QC, Mr Tracy conceded that he was in fact a "corporate doctor" whose role was to make badly performing operations perform better (TS 309 ll 31-32).
8 The third applicant was at all material times a company duly incorporated according to law and was the trustee of the Sunstate Citrus Trust.
It was incorporated by Mr Tracy on 8 February 2005 for the purpose of being the operating entity for the business which was to be conducted on the orchards and Packing Shed (Peter Michael Tracy statement sworn 17 November 2006 at [97]).
The third applicant entered voluntary administration on 23 June 2005.
9 It is clear that Mr Tracy was, at all times, the directing mind and will of the first and third applicants.
10 The respondents in these proceedings are the first respondent, Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd; the second respondent, Mr Andrew Strahley; and the third respondent, Mr David Breed.
11 The first respondent, formerly Sunstate Acquisitions Pty Ltd, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hancock FARM Company Pty Ltd (Hancock).
It had originally acquired 80% of the properties in January 2001 for the sum of $5.6 million plus the cultural costs of growing the 2001 crop prior to the purchase (Andrew Colin Strahley affidavit sworn 12 July 2006 at [11]-[14]), and later acquired the remaining 20%.
The primary relief sought by the applicants in these proceedings is against the first respondent.
12 The second respondent, Mr Strahley, was a director of the first respondent from 19 January 2001, and became Managing Director of Hancock in July 2003.
I understand that his role included oversight of the financial and administration operations of the farms under the management of Hancock.
13 The third respondent, Mr Breed, was employed by the first respondent at the orchards from June 2003 to manage the orchards and Packing Shed.
He remained an employee of the first respondent until 18 March 2005 and was subsequently employed by the third applicant until 23 June 2005.
An unsigned statement of Mr Breed was filed by the applicants on 21 June 2006.
Subsequently, Mr Breed swore an affidavit in these proceedings on 14 July 2006, which was filed by the respondents and tendered in evidence (exhibit R20).
Mr Breed was not represented in these proceedings nor called as a witness by any party to the proceedings.
The relevant properties 
 
14 The three properties the subject of this litigation are located in the Maryborough-Bundaberg area of south east Queensland, and are two citrus orchards and a Packing Shed ("the relevant properties").
15 The orchard located at Tiaro ("the Tiaro orchard") had approximately 26,000 trees, including lemons and a number of mandarin varieties.
The orchard located at Bundaberg ("the Bundaberg orchard") was slightly larger, with approximately 33,000 trees (predominately citrus trees including limes, lemons, mandarin varieties, navels and pomellos).
There was also a small crop of mangoes at the Bundaberg orchard.
16 The Packing Shed was located just outside Maryborough (Strahley affidavit sworn 12 July 2006 at [15]-[17]).
The decision to sell the properties 
 
17 According to evidence of Mr Strahley, in around May 2004 Hancock decided to consider various options as to the future of the relevant properties because they were not performing in accordance with Hancock's return criteria (Strahley affidavit sworn 12 July 2006 at [48]).
Mr Strahley deposed further that in the ordinary course of business the Hancock properties were re-valued every 2 years, and in June 2004 a valuation report ("1 June 2004 Valuation Report") was sought from Mr Rex Neubecker of Herron Todd White Valuers ("HTW") (Strahley affidavit sworn 12 July 2006 at [49]-[55]).
18 Mr Peter Douglas, a real estate agent with Ray White Rural, was engaged from September 2004 to market the Bundaberg and Tiaro orchards and the Packing Shed for the first respondent (Peter Colin Douglas affidavit sworn 6 July 2006 at [13]).
The property went to auction on 26 November 2004 and was passed in on a vendor's bid (Strahley affidavit sworn 12 July 2006 at [60]-[61]).
The preliminary discussions between the parties 
 
19 The negotiations between Mr Tracy and the first respondent commenced in November 2004.
Mr Tracy had had no previous involvement in either the citrus or horticultural industries, however his attention was drawn to the relevant properties by Mr Douglas in late November 2004 (Douglas affidavit sworn 6 July 2006 at [13]; Tracy statement sworn 17 November 2006 at [1]-[2]).
Mr Tracy and Mr Douglas had known each other for several years at that time.
Mr Tracy deposed that he expressed an interest in the relevant properties and Mr Douglas suggested that he would arrange a meeting between Mr Tracy, Mr Strahley and himself, and provide Mr Tracy with an information package (Tracy statement sworn 17 November 2006 at [2]-[5]).
20 In late November 2004 Mr Strahley was informed by Mr Douglas that Mr Tracy might have an interest in looking at the properties.
Mr Strahley subsequently provided Mr Douglas with the 1 June 2004 Valuation Report, and information and historical data about the performance of the orchards in the form of Block Summary data (which had been created by Mr Breed for internal management purposes) (Strahley affidavit sworn 12 July 2006 at [62]-[67]; Douglas affidavit sworn 6 July 2006 at [17]).
21 Mr Douglas gave evidence that during a telephone conversation with Mr Tracy on 1 December 2004 the prospect of a meeting with Mr Strahley was discussed as well as a proposal he had received from Mr Strahley containing broad terms of sale.
