 
1 Four separate applications for a determination of native title under s 61 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NTA) have been made by the Wangkangurru/Yarluyandi (WY), Eringa, Eringa No.
2 and Irrwanyere Mt Dare native title claim groups (together, the claimants), over claim areas along the northern border of South Australia.
The WY claim area also covers the south west corner of Queensland.
Each of the corresponding claim areas include part of the Witjira National Park (the Park) and each of the claim areas overlaps with one or more of the other claim areas.
2 The Park was reserved as a National Park and vested in the Crown under the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 (SA) (NPWA).
Prior to this reservation and vesting in 1985, the whole area now comprising the Park was held under various pastoral leases, pastoral permits, water reserves and miscellaneous leases or was vacant crown land.
3 The Park is currently the subject of two leases.
The first is a 99 year lease between the Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources and Irrwanyere Aboriginal Corporation ("the IAC") over the whole area of the Park save for the area covered by the Mt Dare Lease and two other areas that have been "fenced out" to adjoining pastoral leases.
The lease is dated 5 October 1995 subject to a Deed of Variation dated 13 August 2007 (the lease as varied being "the IAC Lease") and is made pursuant to section 35 of the NPWA for the purposes of the use and occupation by Aboriginal people having traditional association with the Park, the enhancement of the cultural and social aspirations of those people and to achieve the management objectives set for the Park under the NPWA .
The IAC Lease is further expressed not to have any extinguishing effect on the native title rights and interests of those Aboriginal people.
4 The second lease over the Park between the Minister for Environment and Planning and Driveline Pty Ltd dated 1 July 1989 ("the Mount Dare Lease") is over the area of land in and about Mt Dare Homestead as described in that lease.
The Mount Dare Lease is made pursuant to section 35 of the NPWA and is for the purpose of a tourist facility.
It was held by the Indigenous Land Corporation ("ILC") at the time the SAD66/2005 Irrwanyere Mount Dare Determination Application was made.
5 Since 1995, the Park has been managed in accordance with the Management Plan adopted pursuant to the NPWA for the Park dated October 1995.
6 The parties to these determinations agree that section 47A of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (" Native Title Act ") applies to the native title claims to the extent that they relate to the determination areas save as to those two areas that have been "fenced out" to adjoining pastoral leases and that all prior extinguishment over the determination area save as to those two areas is to be disregarded.
A determination of native title would not affect the validity of the reservation of the determination areas as a National Park or its vesting in the Crown or of the grant of the IAC Lease.
7 The Parties executed an Indigenous Land Use Agreement ("the ILUA") and a Co-Management Agreement ("the CMA") relating to the Park on 13 August 2007.
8 The parties to each of the applications for determination of native title who have interests in those parts of the claim areas that cover the Park have reached an agreement and have applied under s 87 and 87A of the NTA for three determinations by consent over those parts of the claims that cover the Park (the determination area).
Despite there being different claimants for each claim, the proposed native title holders are identical across the determination area, being those Lower Southern Arrernte and Wangkangurru persons who have a traditional connection to the determination area, as described in schedule 2 of each of the Determinations.
The determination area covers the whole of the Park, the whole of the Irrwanyere Mt Dare native title claim and part of the other three native title claims.
Maps of the determination area are included in schedule 1 of each of the Determinations.
Background to the agreement 
 
9 The original applications in the WY, Eringa and Eringa No.
2 claims were filed on 21 August 1997, 30 September 1998 and 26 May 1998, respectively.
On 25 March 2002, O'Loughlin J referred the WY claim to the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) for mediation, with the Eringa and Eringa No.
2 claimants being entitled to participate.
The NNTT has regularly reported on the progress of that mediation, most recently on 29 February 2008.
10 One issue dealt with in that mediation was an overlap between the WY, Eringa and Eringa No.
2 claims.
The area of the overlap was primarily over the Park, the lease over which is held by the IAC.
The IAC is comprised of members of each of the claimants with a claim over the Park.
During negotiations facilitated by the NNTT in February 2005, the claimants agreed that the IAC would assume responsibility for each of the claims in the overlap area.
With the overlap issue thus resolved, the NNTT facilitated further negotiations between the legal representatives of the claimants, South Australian Native Title Services Ltd (at the time known as the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement), and the State of South Australia with a view to achieving a consent determination over the Park.
11 At the mediation in February 2005, the claimants also agreed that the IAC should lodge a further application for native title over the part of the overlap area which comprises the Mt Dare homestead lease.
That application (the Irrwanyere Mt Dare claim) was filed on 30 March 2005 and was made specifically for the purpose of securing rights under section 47A of the NTA (the lease was at the time held by the ILC).
12 As a result of the above events, the parties in each of the four claims were able to come to an agreement, and now seek a determination of native title over the Park, by consent.
Orders pursuant to s 67 of the NTA 
 
13 In order that the overlapping portions of the claim areas can be dealt with in the same proceeding, the relevant parties have also applied for orders under s 67 of the NTA.
The proposed orders would effectively split the determination area into three non-overlapping segments.
Those segments would then become separate proceedings over which determinations of native title could be made.
I note that the native title holders will be identical for each of the segments.
The segments are:
 
(a) that part of the WY claim area that overlaps the Park and the Eringa No.
2 claim area (the Wangkangurru/Yarluyandi Part A Proceeding);
 
(b) that part of the WY claim area that overlaps the Park and the Eringa claim area, but not including the area covered by the Irrwanyere Mt Dare claim area (the Eringa Part A Proceeding); and
 
(c) the Irrwanyere Mt Dare claim area (which overlaps the Park and the WY and Eringa claim areas)(the Irrwanyere Mt Dare Proceeding).
14 I consider the orders sought under s 67 to be appropriate.
Accordingly, I make the orders as sought by consent of the parties.
Orders pursuant to s 87 and 87A 
 
15 As the proposed determination in the Irrwanyere Mt Dare Proceeding covers the entire Irrwanyere Mt Dare claim area, the determination is sought under s 87 of the NTA.
Determinations in the other proceedings are sought under s 87A.
The purpose of s 87A as articulated in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill inserting the section is "to facilitate resolution of part of a claim by agreement where certain interest holders agree to a determination being made".
The provision is intended to "assist to prevent those parties with interests that only relate to part of the claim area, and other parties with less significant interests in relation to the overall claim, from blocking resolution of the claim in relation to a separate part of the claim area".
16 Under both section 87 and 87A , in order to make the proposed consent determinations, the Court must be satisfied that it has the power to do so, and that it is appropriate to make the orders sought.
17 Both sections require that the period of notice under s 66 of the NTA must have elapsed and s 87 also requires that a signed copy of the agreed orders be filed with the Court.
The relevant notification periods under s 66 expired on 7 May 2001 (WY), 13 March 1998 (Eringa), 17 September 2003 (Eringa No.
2) and 1 February 2006 (Irrwanyere Mt Dare).
A copy of the orders upon which the parties have agreed was filed in each proceeding to which they are relevant on 13 November 2007.
The minutes of consent orders relating to s 67 were filed later on 28 November 2008.
18 Section 87A(3) states that the Registrar must give notice to the other parties to a proceeding that the proposed determination of native title has been filed with the Court.
On filing of the draft orders a registrar of the Court notified the parties to the WY, Mt Dare and Eringa claims that the proposed consent determinations had been filed in compliance with subsection 87A(3).
The registrar enclosed a copy of the proposed determination and informed parties that they would have 14 days to file an objection.
An identical letter was sent to the parties in the Eringa No.
2 claim on 21 February 2008.
