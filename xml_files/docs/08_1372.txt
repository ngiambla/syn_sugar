 
1 The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who arrived in Australia on 27 May 2005.
2 He applied for a Protection (Class XA) Visa on 22 June 2005.
In a statement dated 21 June 2005 the Appellant set forth that he was born into a Sunni Muslim family but converted to Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat on 1 January 2000.
He went on to state that as he had " changed my religion faith, I am now disowned by family and close relatives ".
The claim for the visa was refused on 18 August 2005.
3 There thereafter followed two hearings before the Refugee Review Tribunal, each of which was set aside by the Federal Magistrates Court.
The decision of the Tribunal which was the subject of review by the Federal Magistrates Court now under appeal is that handed down on 19 February 2008.
That decision affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate not to grant a protection visa.
The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application made to that Court: SZIAI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 788.
4 The Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court raises four Grounds of Appeal , being contentions that the learned Federal Magistrate:
 
(i) erred by failing to find that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error in failing to take into account delays and/or the number of occasions on which the now Appellant was required to give evidence, caused by the number of occasions upon which the claim was remitted to the Tribunal, in making credibility findings based on alleged inconsistencies at different hearings;
 
(ii) further erred in finding that the Tribunal had provided a fair proceeding for the now Appellant when relying on evidence from a third-party questioning the authenticity of documents relied on by the Appellant to corroborate his claim to be a member of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat;
 
(iii) further erred in finding that the Tribunal's decision was " not unreasonable ", in circumstances where the decision was affected by apprehended bias;
 
(iv) further erred in finding that the decision of the Tribunal was a privative clause decision, in circumstances where the Tribunal failed to comply with the requirements of ss 424A and 424AA of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
In addition to these Grounds , the Appellant now seeks leave to amend the existing Notice of Appeal to raise an additional ground, namely:
 
(v) a contravention of s 91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
5 When the appeal was called on for hearing, Counsel for the Appellant only sought to press the second and fifth Grounds.
The remaining Grounds were abandoned.
6 Notwithstanding the terms in which the second Ground of Appeal is now expressed, it is understood that this Ground seeks to contend that the Tribunal should have made further inquiries and, in failing to make those further inquiries, there was a failure to make such inquiries as the Tribunal was authorised to make pursuant to s 427(1)(d) of the 1958 Act and that the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable.
This was an argument raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and resolved against the now Appellant.
7 The fifth Ground of Appeal was an argument raised before the Federal Magistrates Court by the form of Application as filed in that Court.
The argument, however, was there abandoned by Counsel then appearing for the now Appellant .

 APPELLATE JURISDICTION OF THIS COURT 
 
8 In entertaining the current appeal, it is relevant to recall that this Court is exercising appellate jurisdiction, being the jurisdiction conferred by s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to hear an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court.
This Court is not exercising the original jurisdiction conferred by the Commonwealth legislature upon the Federal Magistrates Court by s 476 of the 1958 Act.
The original jurisdiction of this Court conferred by s 476A of the 1958 Act is -- and is expressed to be -- a " limited jurisdiction ".
See: SZITU v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] FCA 758 at [32] per Greenwood J.
9 No argument was advanced, however, on behalf of the Respondent Minister denying the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the fifth Ground sought to be advanced.
The Respondent Minister's position was that this Court should decline to entertain the fresh ground -- not as a matter of jurisdiction -- but rather as a matter of discretion.
No Notice of Objection to the competency of the appeal had been filed.
Counsel for the Respondent Minister submitted that leave to raise an argument as to non-compliance with s 91R(3) should be refused in circumstances where that was an argument raised for resolution before the Federal Magistrates Court, where the now Appellant was there represented by Counsel, and where (for whatever reason) Counsel then appearing for the now Appellant expressly abandoned reliance upon any alleged non-compliance.
10 In the absence of submissions being advanced which properly addressed the concerns as to jurisdiction, and where ultimately it is unnecessary to do so, the present appeal has not been resolved on the basis that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the proposed further Ground of Appeal .
If the issue had been pursued, it is considered that it should have been resolved not by a single Judge of this Court but by the Full Court constituted by three Judges.
A FAILURE TO MAKE INQUIRIES?

 
11 As explained by Counsel for the Appellant, the second Ground of Appeal is understood to relate to two documents provided by the now Appellant to the Tribunal in support of his claim that he had changed his religion.
