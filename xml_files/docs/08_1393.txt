 
1 This is an application by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority ("the Authority") to review the decisions of the first respondent ("the AAT") dated 29 May 2008 purportedly made pursuant to s 41(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("AAT Act") to:
 
 
 (1) stay the operation and implementation of the applicant's removal of certain active constituents from the Record of Approved Active Constituents;
 
 (2) stay the operation and implementation of the applicant's removal of certain chemical products from the Register of Chemical Products.

 
 BACKGROUND 
 
2 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code (the Code), scheduled to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth) ("the Act"), provides for the approval of active constituents of agricultural and veterinary chemical products and for the registration of those chemical products.
3 The Authority is established under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth).
Its functions include, where appropriate, the granting of applications for approval of "active constituents" and for the registration of "chemical products".
These expressions are defined in s 3 of the Code.
Broadly, an active constituent forms part of a chemical product.
Sections 17 and 18 respectively require the Authority to keep a Record of Approved Active Constituents for Chemical Products ("the Record") and a Register of Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products.
The latter is, by virtue of s 3 , referred to in the Act as the Register of Chemical Products ("the Register").
4 Decisions to approve and register made under s 19(1) and s 20(1) respectively are given effect by entering "relevant particulars" together with any conditions of approval in the Record and Register under s 19(2) and s 20(2) respectively.
"Relevant particulars" include particulars prescribed by regulation.
An approval or a registration must include, as part of the prescribed particulars of each active constituent and each chemical product required to be entered in the Record and the Register, the name of each manufacturer and the address of each site of manufacture.
Evergreen Nurture Agrochemicals Ltd (Evergreen) was included in the Record and Register as a manufacturer of certain active constituents and chemical products.
Evergreen is a fictitious name admittedly provided by Imtrade to the Authority.
The address provided was also incorrect.
Imtrade did this because it did not want this information to be made available to its competitors.
It did not think that the information was relevant to the decision of the Authority whether or not to approve active constituents or to register chemical products.
The primary issue is whether this deliberate misrepresentation constitutes fraud on the Authority such as to vitiate each of the approvals and registrations.
5 The current proceedings relate to the approval of nine active constituents and the registration of 52 chemical products in the name of the second respondent (Imtrade).
These active constituents and chemical products are set out as attachments to a letter of the Authority to the solicitors for Imtrade, dated 21 May 2008.
There is no dispute about the identification of the relevant constituents and products, or that Evergreen is recorded as a manufacturer of each of them.
6 The matter comes before this Court following action by the Authority to treat the relevant approvals and registrations as invalid and to remove them from the Record and Register.
Forty-seven of the registrations were validly registered initially but were subject to variation under the Code by adding Evergreen in each case as a formulator.
It is common ground that this is another name for a manufacturer.
The variations were said to have been achieved by fraud and therefore it is contended by the Authority that those registrations as varied are also invalid.
The Authority took this action on the basis of its view that the fraud of Imtrade vitiated each of the approvals and registrations.
Imtrade sought to characterise this action as a decision by the Authority under Division 5 of Part 2, of the Code to cancel the several approvals and registrations reviewable in the AAT under s 167(1)(f) of the Code.
7 The Authority contends that it did not cancel or even purport to cancel the approvals and registrations under the provisions of the Code.
There is no decision, it says, for review by the AAT, and its jurisdiction is not attracted.
RELIEF SOUGHT 
 
8 The applicant seeks an order quashing the decision of the AAT pursuant to s 16(1)(a) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act "), and a declaration that the AAT had no jurisdiction to issue the stay orders so issued pursuant to s 16(1)(c).
9 The applicant also seeks to enliven the original jurisdiction of the Court under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) by seeking a writ of prohibition against the AAT restraining the AAT from proceeding to review the removal of the entries in question from the Record and Register.
10 Founded on that original jurisdiction, the applicant also seeks declarations pursuant to s 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) in the Court's accrued jurisdiction: Queensland Medical Laboratory v Blewett (1988) 84 ALR 615 at 637 per Gummow J.
Those declarations are to the effect that the approval of the active constituents and registration of the chemical products are of no legal effect because they were affected, procured, or induced by fraud.
11 Further, the applicant seeks a writ of certiorari against the AAT, quashing its decision to issue the stay orders commensurate with the ancillary or accrued jurisdiction of the Court to issue a writ of prohibition sought under s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act : Klewer v Dutch [2000] FCA 509 ; (2000) 99 FCR 217 at 230 [53] - [54] per Hill J.
THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK 
 
12 The Code is part of a legislative scheme including the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth), the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth), and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 (Cth).
13 The second reading speech in respect of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill contained the following: 
 Through this mechanism, evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products and related matters will be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals.
The control measures apply up to the point of retail sale with the states and territories remaining responsible for control of use matters.
...
The agvet code focuses on the registration of chemical products, approval of active constituents, and approval of labels.
The overriding criteria to be addressed by the NRA are public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade and commerce.
The public will be invited to comment in respect of each chemical product containing a new active constituent prior to determination of an application.
The NRA will also be able to reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure it continues to meet contemporary safety and performance standards.
14 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 states that it is an Act " to make provision for the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products, and for related matters... .
" This Act, and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 , each contain a preamble recognising, relevantly the following:
 
 
 (a) that the protection of the health and safety of human beings, animals and the environment is essential to the well-being of society and can be enhanced by putting in place a system to regulate agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products; and 
 
 (b) that the principle of ecologically sustainable development requires a regulatory system that is designed to ensure that the use of such products at the present time will not impair the prospects of future generations; and 
 
 (c) that the furthering of trade and commerce between Australia and places outside Australia, and the present and future economic viability and competitiveness of primary industry and of a domestic industry for manufacturing and formulating such products, are essential for the well being of the economy and require a system for regulating such products that is cost effective, efficient, predictable, adaptive and responsive; and 
 
 (d) that it is desirable to establish a regulatory system that is open and accountable and gives opportunity for public input with respect to the regulation of such products; ...
 
 

15 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 establishes the Authority and confers functions on it, including those set out in s 7.
16 The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 applies the Code, as in force for the time being, as a law for the government of participating Territories.
17 The object of the Code is set out in s 1: 
 The object of this Code is to make provision for and in relation to: 
 
 (a) the evaluation, approval, and control of the supply, of active constituents for proposed or existing agricultural chemical products or veterinary chemical products; and 
 
 (b) the evaluation, registration, and control of the manufacture and supply, of agricultural chemical products and veterinary chemical products.

 

18 In relation to the approval of active constituents and the registration of chemical products, s 3 defines the term relevant particulars relevantly as follows: 
 relevant particulars means: 
 
 (a) in relation to the approval of an active constituent for a proposed or existing chemical product --- the distinguishing number, instructions for use and other particulars that are required by paragraph 19(2)(a) to be entered in the Record of Approved Active Constituents; and 
 (b) in relation to the registration of a chemical product --- the distinguishing number and other particulars that are required by paragraph 20(2)(a) to be entered in the Register of Chemical Products; ...
 (Emphasis added) 
 
 
The relevant particulars also include relevantly "particulars of a variation of relevant particulars that is made under para 29(1)(h) ...".
I will refer to these later in the context of the purported variations to the relevant particulars in respect of the 47 valid registrations.
19 Applications for approval of an active constituent and for registration of a chemical product are, by s 10 to be made to the Authority.
Section 11 provides for how such applications are made.
20 By s 19(2)(a) , approval of an active constituent takes place by the Authority entering in the Record of Approved Active Constituents the relevant particulars, which include "any other particulars that are prescribed by the regulations.
" Similarly by s 20(2)(a) , registration of chemical product takes place by the Authority entering in the Register of Chemical Products the relevant particulars, including those prescribed by the regulations.
21 Any person may inspect and obtain a copy of or extract from any part of the Record [s 17(4) and (5)] and Register [s 18(4) and (5)] that does not contain confidential commercial information which is defined under s 3.
Section 3(c)(ii) may well result in the information prescribed under Reg 15 and Reg 16 being confidential.
22 Regulation 15 and 16 of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations 1995 provide as follows: 
 Reg 15 Particulars of approved active constituents to be recorded (1) Subject to subregulation (2), for the purposes of subsection 19 (2) of the Code, the following particulars must be entered in the Record of Approved Active Constituents in relation to the approval of an active constituent: (a) if a name is given to the active constituent by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry -- that name; (b) if no name is given to the active constituent by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry -- the name given to the active constituent in an order, publication or approval referred to in regulation 42 that specifies the standard for the active constituent for the purposes of that regulation; (c) the common name for the active constituent proposed by the applicant and accepted by the APVMA; (d) the composition and purity of the active constituent; (e) the name of the manufacturer of the active constituent; (f) the address of each site at which the active constituent is manufactured by the manufacturer; (g) the name and business address of the applicant; (h) the date of entry of these particulars in the Record of Approved Active Constituents; (j) the date (if any) on which the approval ends.
(Emphasis added) (2) In relation to an active constituent approved in accordance with section 14A of the Code, the particulars mentioned in paragraphs (1) (c) to (j) need be entered in the Record of Approved Active Constituents only if those particulars are readily available to the APVMA.
Reg 16 Particulars of registered chemical products to be recorded For the purposes of subsection 20(2) of the Code (which deals with registration of a chemical product), the following particulars must be entered in the Register of Chemical Products in relation to the registration of a chemical product: 
 
 (a) the distinguishing name of the chemical product proposed by the applicant and accepted by the APVMA; 
 (b) the constituents of the chemical product; 
 (c) the concentration of each constituent of the chemical product; 
 (d) if possible, the composition and purity of each active constituent of the chemical product; 
 (e) the name and business address of the applicant; 
 (f) the name of each State or Territory in respect of which the chemical product is registered; 
 (g) the name of each manufacturer of the chemical product ; 
 (h) the address of each site at which the chemical product is manufactured by the manufacturer ; 
 (j) the date of entry of these particulars in the Register of Chemical Products; 
 (k) the date on which the registration ends.
(Emphasis added) 
 
 
23 The date of approval of an active constituent, and the date of registration of a chemical product, is the date on which the relevant particulars are entered in the Record or Register: s 22(1) of the Code.
If any of the relevant particulars are varied, then, the date of the approval or the registration, as varied, is the date on which particulars of the variations are entered in the Record or Register: s 22(2) of the Code.
24 By s 14(1) of the Code, the Authority must grant an application for approval or registration made under s 10 if it is satisfied of all the matters referred to in s 14(3).
If the Authority is not satisfied of all those matters, then, under s 14(2) it must refuse an application.
