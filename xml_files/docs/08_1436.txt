 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 These three proceedings concern Pt XIC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the Act) headed "Telecommunications Access Regime".
Part XIC was introduced into the Act by the Trade Practices Amendment (Telecommunications) Act 1997 (No 58 of 1997) (see item 6 of Sch 1) with effect from 30 April 1997.
It provides for a regulated access regime specific to telecommunications services.
By way of contrast, Part IIIA of the Act provides for a general access regime not limited to a specific industry.
Section 152CK of the Act provides for the interaction between the two regimes, but it is not of present relevance.
2 The proceedings relate to access to the High Frequency Unconditioned Local Loop Service, also known as the Line Sharing Service (LSS).
The applicant (Telstra) owns the lines over which the LSS is provided.
3 There were access disputes between Telstra and the second respondents in the three proceedings in relation to access to the LSS.
I will refer to the access seekers by the following abbreviations:
 
 
 Chime Communications Pty Ltd Chime
 Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd Primus
 Request Broadband Pty Ltd Request 
 

In certain circumstances, Pt XIC permits an access dispute to be arbitrated by the first respondent, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC --- referred to as the Commission in the Act and in various parts of the evidence and in the parties' submissions).
Arbitration takes place under Div 8 of Pt XIC.
4 Pursuant to the mechanism in Div 8, ACCC made a final determination in respect of each access dispute.
Telstra seeks review of each of the final determinations.
5 The three proceedings were heard together, the evidence in each being evidence in the others, subject to all just exceptions on grounds of relevance.
6 In the table below, I identify, in summary form, the grounds of review referable to various paragraphs in s 5(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (ADJR Act) on which Telstra relies, leaving until later the explanation of the grounds.
Each "Ground No" is a reference to the number of the ground in the relevant amended application.
The capitalised letters of the alphabet in bold in the left hand column indicate the grouping of those grounds that I use at [123]ff below.
Ground of review relied on by Telstra Request proceeding 
 Ground No Chime 
 proceeding 
 Ground No Primus 
 proceeding 
 Ground No A Failure to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, Telstra's cost model 1 1 NA A Denial of procedural fairness by failing to afford Telstra a reasonable opportunity to present its case with respect to Telstra's cost model 2(a) 2(a) N/A D Denial of procedural fairness by denying Telstra a reasonable opportunity to present its case as to whether Telstra was recovering its line costs 2(b) 2(b) N/A A Procedural ultra vires in relation to Telstra's cost model --- failure to comply with s 152DB(1)(b) of the Act 3 3 N/A B Decision made in excess of jurisdiction, not authorised by the Act and otherwise contrary to law because decision expressed to have effect until 31 December 2007, yet the declaration of the LSS pursuant to s 152AL(3) of the Act expired on 31 October 2007 4 4 1 C Procedural ultra vires and failure to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, the direct costs of providing access to the LSS (s 152CR(1)(d)) in adopting the Pooling and Allocation Method 5(a) 5(a) N/A C Procedural ultra vires and failure to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, the long-term interests of end-users and in particular the legitimate commercial interests of Telstra including its ability to exploit economies of scale and scope (ss 152CR(1)(a), and 152AB(2)(e) and (6)(b) of the Act) in adopting the Pooling and Allocation Method 5(b) 5(b) N/A C Procedural ultra vires and failure to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, the LSS Pricing Principles (s 152AQA(6) of the Act) in adopting the Pooling and Allocation Method 5(c) 5(c) N/A C Error of law in misconstruing s 152CR(1)(d) of the Act in concluding that the Pooling and Allocation Method allowed Telstra to recover its costs, including its direct costs 6 6 N/A D Error of law by making a finding of fact that Telstra was recovering its line costs when there was no evidence to justify the finding 7 7 N/A E Procedural ultra vires when determining disconnection charges by not enquiring of Telstra concerning, or investigating solutions to address, the practical difficulties of adopting a more precise test than Option 2 --- failure to comply with s 152DB(1)(b) of the Act 8 N/A 2 E Denial of procedural fairness by failing to afford Telstra a reasonable opportunity to present its case in relation to disconnection charges by failing to disclose the issue of Option 2 9(a) N/A 3(a) E Denial of procedural fairness by failing to afford Telstra a reasonable opportunity to present its case in relation to disconnection charges by failing to disclose the material constituting the practical difficulties of a more precise test than Option 2 9(b) N/A 3(b) F Failure to take into account a relevant consideration, namely, Telstra's costs when determining disconnection charges during the No Charge Period 10(a) N/A 4(a) F Procedural ultra vires by failing to take into account matters referred to in s 152CR(1) and to have regard to the LSS Pricing Principles when determining disconnection charges during the No Charge Period 10(b) N/A 4(b) F Jurisdictional error by asking itself the wrong question in relation to disconnection charges during the No Charge Period 10(c) N/A 4(c) 
7 As can be seen, all of the grounds are raised in the Request proceeding, but not all of them are raised in the Chime proceeding or Primus proceeding.
(An eleventh ground was raised in all three proceedings but, as noted at [26] below, it is no longer relevant.
) Accordingly, evidence was led in the Request proceeding on the basis that it would also be all the evidence relevant to the issues in the Chime proceeding and Primus proceeding.
Conformably with that course, I will refer to the Request proceeding alone, but in doing so I will necessarily also be addressing the issues in the Chime proceeding and the Primus proceeding.
8 In due course I will deal with Telstra's grounds of review in the following sections:
 Section Section title Telstra's grounds A Telstra's Cost Model 1, 2(a), 3 B Invalidity of Final Determination 4 C Pooling and Allocation Method 5(a), 5(b), 5(c), 6 D Line Costs Recovery 2(b), 7 E Disconnection Charges, Churn Process and "Option 2" 8, 9(a), 9(b) F Disconnection Charges, Backdating and the "No Charge Period" 10(a), 10(b), 10(c) 

 
9 Telstra contends in respect of each of its grounds of review that the result is that the decision is invalid or is liable to be set aside (although Telstra concedes in respect of Section B (Invalidity of Final Determination) that the decision would be invalid only in respect of the period after 31 October 2007).
10 I agreed to the parties' request that I publish my reasons for judgment without making orders, and allow the parties the opportunity to make submissions on the orders to be made.
SOME TECHNICAL MATTERS 
 
11 The proceedings have been characterised by numerous acronyms and terms, some of which relate to technical matters.
Annexure A to these reasons is an alphabetical list of acronyms and technical terms and their meanings.
12 Telstra owns a variety of networks which it uses to provide telecommunication services.
One such network is the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
Through the PSTN, Telstra provides to end-users various telephony and data services such as local, long distance, national and international calls and dial-up internet connections.
Another Telstra network is its "Broadband" network.
The PSTN and the Broadband network use what is called the Customer Access Network (CAN).
Generally speaking, the CAN can be understood to be the network of connections between end-users, whether business or private, and some aggregation point within the network, which is usually a local exchange building.
13 Connection between the end-user and that point within the network is normally achieved by way of "line" (or "metallic pair" or "twisted pair") of copper or aluminium wire, or where there is no fixed line, by radio.
The copper or aluminium wire is often referred to as "unconditioned communications wire".
It forms a continuous copper or aluminium path between the premises of end-users and exchanges and is commonly referred to as the Unconditioned Local Loop (ULL), "local loop" or, simply, "line".
The word "unconditioned" signifies that the wire is bare or unqualified, that is, the equipment required to make it serviceable is not yet attached to it.
14 Both the LSS and another service referred to below, the Unconditioned Local Loop Service (ULLS), are provided over the CAN, and to a retail customer, or end-user, over a ULL.
The CAN is the generic expression which applies to all of the ULLs: the ULLs, taken together, constitute the CAN.
