He saw operational service within the meaning of s 6C of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) on ten voyages to and from South Vietnam as a member of the crew of HMAS Sydney between 1970 and 1972.
Mr Gilkinson suffers from sleep apnoea for which he claimed a pension under the Act.
He claimed that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal committed errors of law when it held that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his operational service did not contribute to his being obese at the time of the clinical onset of his sleep apnoea.
