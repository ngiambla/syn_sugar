 
1 Granitgard Pty Ltd ("Granitgard"), has, by notices of motion, brought applications in respect of three matters touching upon issues of practice and procedure.
They are:
 
1. further and better discovery by Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ("Termicide");
 
2. a challenge to a claim for legal professional privilege in respect of various documents; and
 
3. an application for leave to administer an interrogatory.
2 I proceed to consider the merits of each of these separately.
FURTHER AND BETTER DISCOVERY 
 
3 On 15 February 2008, I made an order pursuant to O 15 r 2 and r 3 of the Federal Court Rules that each party file and serve a list of documents, verified on oath, as to documents within the category specified in Sch B to that order.
Part B of Sch B detailed the categories of documents for discovery by Termicide.
Those categories of documents were as follows :
 
1.
A spreadsheet showing the number of installations of Termiglass by the Respondent on a quarterly basis.
2.
All correspondence, reports or site inspection records relating to any property in which Termiglass has been installed and which allegations of penetration by termites has occurred.
3.
All protocols relied upon by Dr French in carrying out tests on crushed glass as a physical termite barrier.
4.
All documents in relation to any contract or arrangement made between the Respondent and Dr French or the Respondent and CSIRO in relation to the testing of crushed glass and/or the assessment of the Termiglass system as a physical termite barrier.
5.
All documents recording all testing of crushed glass carried out by Dr French as a physical termite barrier.
6.
All correspondence, file notes, memoranda and any other documents recording communications between the Respondent (or any person on its behalf) and Dr French and/or the CSIRO in relation to the testing of crushed glass and/or the assessment of the Termiglass system as a physical termite barrier.
7.
All documents recording all testing of crushed glass or the Termiglass system as a physical termite barrier carried out by or on behalf of the Respondent or otherwise supplied to the Respondent or on its behalf.
8.
All correspondence, file notes, memoranda and any other documents recording communications between the Respondent (or any person on its behalf) any other person in relation to the testing of crushed glass and/or the assessment of the Termiglass system as a physical termite barrier.
4 Order 15 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules is in these terms: 
 
 
 8 Order for particular discovery 
 
 
Where, at any stage of the proceeding, it appears to the Court from evidence or from the nature or circumstances of the case or from any document filed in the proceeding that there are grounds for a belief that some document or class of document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding may be or may have been in the possession, custody or power of a party, the Court may order that party: 
 
 (a) to file any affidavit stating whether that document or any document of that class is or has been in his possession, custody or power and, if it has been but is not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it; and
 (b) to serve the affidavit on any other party.

 
 
5 By a letter dated 30 April 2008, Granitgard, by its solicitors, identified 29 types of document in respect of which it was alleged that Termicide's discovery was deficient.
A response to that letter was made on behalf of Termicide by its solicitors on 16 May 2008.
That response conveniently tabulates the impugned types of document, together with the response made on behalf of Termicide in respect of those documents which is outlined below:
 
 Applicant's Request of 30 April 2008 Status 1 The termiglass specification referred to in CSIRO appraisal No further documentation to be discovered 2 The summary of particle density dated 10 July 2003 referred to in letter from Vision Glass Recycling dated 11 July 2003 (document 1) This has already been discovered as part of document 17 3 All correspondence and documents provided to Dr French as referred to in Dr French's facsimile dated 5 November 2003 (document 5) There were no documents or correspondence referred to in Dr French's facsimile.
Dr French referred to "the materials you kindly delivered".
The materials delivered were samples of sintered glass and are no longer in the possession, custody or power of the Respondent and do not comprise a document.
4 All correspondence and documents provided to BLS Consulting and Barry Schafer in relation to termiglass for the purpose of obtaining the appraisal or draft appraisal as referred to in the facsimile from BLS dated 18 November 2003 (document 7) No further documentation to be discovered.
Any documentation that was in the possession of the Respondent has been lost over time due to both changes in administration staff and the Respondent moving premises.
5 The termiglass installation manual and the Granitgarrd specifications as referred to in the letter from BLS to CSIRO dated 26 November 2003 (document 8) and also referred to in the affidavit of Dr Ewart dated 23 April 2008 The termiglass installation manual has already been put into evidence by the Applicant (annexed to the affidavits of Dr Don Ewart sworn 17 December 2007 and 23 April 2008).
The Respondent has reasonable belief that the Granitgard specifications are already in the possession of the Applicant and is not required to discover that document under Order 15 Rule 2(4) 6 The documents attached to the email dated 1 December 2002 from Barry Schafer to Paul Jeynes relating to the sieve analysis (document 9) No further documentation to be discovered.
Any documentation that was in the possession of the Respondent has been lost over time due to both changes in administration staff and the Respondent moving premises.
7 The grading specifications from the University of Hawaii as referred to in the email dated 1 December 2003 from Barry Schafer to Paul Jeynes (document 9) The Respondent has reasonable belief that the University of Hawaii specifications are already in the possession of the Applicant and is not required to discover that document under Order 15 Rule 2(4)

Dr Ewart mentions in his affidavit of 17 December 2007 that he has read these specifications.
