 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This proceeding concerns whether an allotment of shares was issued for an improper purpose and is a rehearing of a trial heard by another Judge of this Court as ordered by the Full Court on 15 August 2008.
For the reasons which follow, after a consideration of the evidence before me on this rehearing, I have come to the view that the allotment was not for an improper purpose and was made bona fide in the best interests of Life Therapeutics Limited ('LFE').
Contrary to the contention of the plaintiff, I do not accept that the allotment of shares was done to defeat any perceived predator or to consolidate the collective position of the directors of LFE.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 LFE is a public company whose shares are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ('ASX').
Before the allotment of the shares in issue in this proceeding, LFE had issued 123,223,857 shares with voting rights.
3 Between 14 May and 4 June 2008 Bell IXL Investments Limited ('Bell IXL') acquired 9,517,734 shares in LFE.
Bell IXL's shares in LFE together with those of its associate, K Pagnin Pty Limited (3,018,000 shares) ('K Pagnin'), comprised approximately 10.17% of the issued capital of LFE.
4 On 23 May 2008 Bell IXL requisitioned LFE to convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to consider resolutions to remove the current board and replace it with three persons nominated by Bell IXL.
On 12 June 2008 LFE convened that meeting for 23 July 2008.
The meeting has been adjourned as a result of orders of this Court.
5 On 9 June 2008 Aegis Partners Limited ('Aegis') agreed to accept a placement of 15% of LFE's issued shares at 7 cents per share.
Aegis informed LFE that clients of Aegis would take 18,483,578 shares at 7 cents per share.
On 16 June 2008 LFE announced to the ASX that it had agreed to issue to Aegis 18,483,578 fully paid ordinary shares (representing 15% of its total issued capital) at 7 cents per share.
At a board meeting of LFE on 17 June 2008, the directors noted that a subscription application for 18,483,578 shares (to raise $1,293,850.46) had been received from Aegis on 12 June 2008 and resolved to approve that issue and placement.
Under the subscription agreement between LFE and Aegis, Aegis could nominate nominees to whom the shares were to be issued.
On 4 July 2008 LFE received the subscription amount for the shares and announced to the ASX that the placement to Aegis had been completed.
The shares were not allotted to Aegis but rather, in accordance with instructions from Aegis, were allotted to Bell Potter who allocated them to various nominee account holders.
On 10 July 2008 LFE announced to the ASX that Aegis had directed Bell Potter to place the shares directly with various beneficial owners.
6 This allotment represented approximately 13.04% of the voting shares in LFE and reduced Bell IXL's interest in LFE's capital to approximately 8.85% (at least as at 4 June 2008).
7 Before the month of May 2008 the directors of LFE had considered a capital raising by the company for a sum between $5 million and $20 million.
On a date which was contested between the parties, two of LFE's directors, Messrs Bellman and Milne, met with Mr Booth of Asandas, a licensed stockbroker, to discuss a capital raising by LFE ('the Booth meeting').
Neither Mr Booth nor Asandas was retained as a broker by LFE.
The Booth meeting led to a chain of events which resulted in the allotment of the shares in issue on 4 July 2008.
8 Some further background facts about LFE are important to record.
LFE is a holding company whose subsidiaries in the United States of America collect and sell blood plasma.
LFE's operations became unprofitable during 2006 and 2007, and in the early part of 2008 its financial position was precarious.
This historical financial position is important in understanding the approach of the directors, to which I will later return.
