 
1 By notice of motion in these proceedings, Les Laboratoires Servier ('Servier') seeks to amend its Australian Patent No 2001276418 ('the Alpha Crystalline Patent') pursuant to s 105 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth).
In support of that application, Servier relies on the affidavits of Mr Richard Hamer, the partner of Allens Arthur Robinson who has the conduct of the proceedings on behalf of Servier.
Mr Hamer states that he is aware of the facts deposed to in his affidavits from his own involvement in the proceedings except for certain information obtained from the patent records.
2 Apotex Pty Ltd ('Apotex') has served a notice to produce on Servier.
Apotex seeks documents, for example, those recording or referring to Mr Hamer's views as expressed in the affidavits, including his views that amendments to the Alpha Crystalline Patent were necessary.
Apotex also requires discovery of, for example, instructions from Servier to Allens Arthur Robinson, as referred to in the affidavits.
3 Servier claims privilege over those documents.
Apotex contends that Servier has waived any such privilege.
