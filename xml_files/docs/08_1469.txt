 Background to the case and its outcome 
 
1 It is not lawfully possible in Australia to extinguish native title in a way which is contrary to the Native Title Act 1993 : s 11(1) Native Title Act .
To that end, unless a provision of the Native Title Act provides otherwise, a future act is invalid to the extent that it affects native title: s 24OA Native Title Act .
Section 227 of the Native Title Act states that, "An act affects native title if it extinguishes the native title rights and interests or if it is otherwise wholly or partly inconsistent with their continued existence, enjoyment or exercise" (Emphasis in the original).
2 The Second Respondent, Queensland Water Infrastructure Pty Ltd (QWI), is the company responsible for the development of the Traveston Crossing Dam.
Stage 1 of that development involves the construction of a new dam in the Mary River, about 100 km north of Brisbane and some 27 km upstream from Gympie.
The total project area for Stage 1 is some 3000 hectares.
QWI is obliged under Queensland subordinate legislation made under the Water Act 2000 (Qld) to "take all necessary steps to prepare for, and construct, the Traveston Crossing Dam Stage 1" by 31 December 2011: s 87(1)(a) and Sch 10B, Item 12 Water Regulation 2002 (Qld).
The development is one of a number of measures conceived by the Queensland Governor in Council to be necessary to be carried out to ensure the security of essential water supplies to the South-East Queensland region: s 82 Water Regulation 2002 (Qld).
3 The project for the development of the Traveston Crossing Dam Stage 1 is a "future act" for the purposes of the Native Title Act : s 233 , definition of "future act" and s 226 , definition of "act".
4 One way in which validity can be secured under the Native Title Act in respect of a future act which affects native title is via what is known as an "indigenous land use agreement" (ILUA).
Once such an agreement is registered by the Native Title Registrar (the Registrar) on the Register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements (the Register), a future act is valid to the extent that it affects land or waters in the area covered by the ILUA: s 24EB Native Title Act .
5 Conceiving that it may be possible that native title might exist in respect of at least some areas within the project area, and so as to ensure the validity for the purposes of the Native Title Act of the undertaking of the proposed works, QWI entered into negotiations with persons who claimed to hold native title within or which overlapped the project area.
QWI's aim was to secure the making and subsequent registration of a particular type of ILUA known as an area agreement.
6 The requirements for the making and registration of such an ILUA are set out in Subdiv C of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the Native Title Act (s 24CA to s 24CL).
It will be necessary later to consider these requirements in some detail.
7 The culmination of the negotiations was the making of what at least purported to be an area agreement.
It is known as the Traveston Crossing Dam Indigenous Land Use Agreement (the Traveston Dam Agreement).
8 QWI subsequently applied to the Registrar to register the Traveston Dam Agreement on the Register.
Section 24CJ of the Native Title Act requires the Registrar to decide whether or not to register an agreement.
On 14 April 2008 the First Respondent, a delegate of the Registrar (the Delegate), decided to register the Traveston Dam Agreement.
The Delegate later, on 19 May 2008, furnished reasons for her making that decision.
9 The Applicants are each persons who claim to hold native title in relation to the project area.
It is no part of the court's role in this case to decide whether or not they do in fact hold native title.
Pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (AD(JR) Act), the Applicants have sought the judicial review of the agreement registration decision made by the Delegate.
10 Neither the question of whether the agreement registration decision was amenable to review under the AD(JR) Act nor, in the end, the question of whether the Applicants were "persons aggrieved" proved to be controversial issues in this case.
It suffices therefore to do no more with respect to these subjects than to record that I am satisfied that the decision is one amenable to review under the AD(JR) Act and that, for the purposes of that Act, the Applicants are each "persons aggrieved".
11 Given that QWI was an active contradictor, the Delegate properly took the stance of abiding the order of the court and not wishing to be heard save if need be in respect of costs: R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 , at 17, 35-36.
12 For the reasons which follow, I have concluded that the various grounds upon which, by their amended application, the Applicants sought the judicial review of the agreement registration decision do not lead to the result that the decision should be set aside.
Work done under the Traveston Dam Agreement is therefore a valid future act for the purposes of the Native Title Act .
Grounds of Review 
 
13 The grounds of review which came to be advanced by the Applicants are set out below:
 
 
 1.
The First Respondent erred in law and/or improperly exercised the power conferred upon her in finding that the requirements of Section 24CG(3)(b) of the Native Title Act had been satisfied in circumstances where: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the Gubbi Gubbi People and the Kabi Kabi People were part of the same wider group;
 (b) The First Respondent failed to take into account the following relevant considerations in reaching the conclusion that the Gubbi Gubbi People and the Kabi Kabi People were part of the same wider group: 
 
 
(i) That membership of the Gubbi Gubbi People was based on matrilineal descent from the apical ancestors James Crowe and Maggie Palmer whereas membership of the Kabi Kabi People was based on cognatic descent from a number of apical ancestors in addition to James Crowe and Maggie Palmer; and (ii) That the Gubbi Gubbi People have a mandatory traditional decision making process in relation to matters affecting land involving the reaching of a consensus decision by the Elders of the respective family groups within the clan without recourse to a majority vote of the group as adopted by the Kabi Kabi People when purporting to authorise the ILUA.

 
 
 (c) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the Gubbi Gubbi People did not adhere to a mandatory traditional decision making process as aforesaid;
 (d) The First Respondent failed to take into consideration the fact that the Gubbi Gubbi People both before and at the authorisation meeting disputed the decision making process adopted at the authorisation meeting and did not authorise the making of the ILUA;
 (e) The First Respondent concluded that there was no mandatory traditional decision making process applicable to the subject decision in reliance upon evidence that emanated from persons who where no traditional custodians of such information;
 (f) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably have concluded that the Gubbi Gubbi People withdrew from the agreement making process;
 (g) The evidence showed that the Gubbi Gubbi People were not afforded the opportunity to separately consider the terms of the ILUA in accordance with the their mandatory traditional decision making process, in circumstances where the persons said to hold native title where encompassed by three separately represented constituent groups;
 (h) By reason of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1(a) --- (g) hereof the Applicants are not bound by the Kabi Kabi Peoples authorisation decision and did not themselves authorise the meeting of the ILUA.

 
 
 
 
 2.
The First Respondent erred in law and/or improperly exercise the power conferred on her in: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Limiting her registration decision to the criteria set out in Section 24CL of the Native Title Act ; 
 (b) Failing to consider or properly consider whether the ILUA was an area agreement that complied with the requirements of Sections 24CB and 24CE of the Native Title Act .

 (c) Failing to find that the Cultural Heritage Investigation Management Agreement ("the CHIMA") component of the ILUA contravened the provisions of the ACHA and so by reason of Section 24CE of the Native Title Act , that the ILUA was invalid either in whole or in part and was thereby no an area agreement capable of being registered.

 (d) Failing to find that the CHIMA component of the ILUA in so far as it dealt with the regulation of Cultural Heritage matters over land where Native Title rights had been extinguished was no properly the subject matter of an area agreement pursuant to Section 24CB of the Native title Act and thereby the ILUA was not an area agreement capable of being registered.

 
 
 
 Particulars 
 
 
 
 
 (a) The CHIMA regulates Aboriginal Cultural Heritage matters as defined in the ACHA over areas where Native Title rights have been extinguished; and 
 (b) To the extent that the ILUA deal with areas where Native Title rights have been extinguished: 
 
 
(i) The Aboriginal Party under the ACHA ought to have been a party to the ILUA as required by Section 23(3)(a)(iii) of the ACHA; (ii) The Aboriginal ILUA Parties did not have standing under the Native Title Act to enter into ILUA which purported to regulate Aboriginal Cultural Heritage matters over such areas; and (iii) It is not competent for an ILUA to deal with Cultural Heritage maters properly regulated by existing State legislation over land where Native Title rights do not exist.
14 The underlined grounds were added by amendment by leave.
Though the granting of leave was opposed by QWI, it seemed to me that the further grounds had been foreshadowed sufficiently far in advance of the hearing by the Applicants as not to be unfair to entertain them and that they did not occasion any evidentiary embarrassment.
15 The grounds of review do, as QWI submitted, lend themselves to grouping by category of challenge.
As pleaded, ground 1(h) is a derivative ground whose fate depends upon the fate of grounds 1(a) to 1(g).
Prima facie , ground 1(e) appears to be an impermissible solicitation to conduct merits review of the Delegate's decision.
Nonetheless, I have considered it in conjunction with other grounds in the way now indicated.
Taking into account those grounds added by amendment, it is convenient to categorise and consider the grounds of review as follows:
 
(a) no evidence grounds --- 1 (a), 1(c), 1(e) and 1(f);
 
(b) failure to take into account allegedly relevant considerations grounds --- grounds 1(b), 1(d) and 1(g);
 
(c) whether the Traveston Dam Agreement may be characterised as an ILUA either having regard to its Cultural Heritage Investigation Management Agreement (CHIMA) provisions, the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld) (ACHA)or otherwise --- ground 2.
16 Before so doing, some preliminary observations ought to be made about the material provisions of the statutory scheme for the registration of an ILUA and about the ability of the Applicants in these proceedings to challenge whether the Traveston Dam Agreement is in law an area agreement.
Preliminary Observations --- Statutory Scheme 
 
17 An agreement which meets the requirements of s 24CB - 24CE of the Native Title Act is an ILUA: s 24CA Native Title Act .
Such an agreement is termed an "area agreement": see the heading to Subdiv C of Div 3 of Pt 2 of that Act, "Indigenous land use agreements (area agreements)" which heading forms part of that Act by virtue of s 13(1) Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth).
It is from that heading that the term "area agreement" is derived for this particular type of ILUA.
Other types of ILUA for which the Native Title Act makes provision are what that Act terms a "body corporate agreement" (Subdiv B of Div 3 of Pt 2 refers) and an "alternative procedure agreement" (Subdiv D of Div 3 of Pt 2 refers) respectively.
18 Section 24CB requires that an area agreement must be about one or more of a number of specified matters about an area.
If there are registered native title bodies corporate for the whole of a particular area, an area agreement must not be made in respect of that area: s 24CC Native Title Act .
Were this to be the case in this instance, and it is not, a body corporate agreement would be the apt type of ILUA.
19 Those who may be parties to an area agreement are specified in s 24CD of the Native Title Act .
It is mandatory that all persons in the relevant "native title group" be parties to an area agreement: s 24CD(1).
20 A "native title group" is an artificial statutory construct the membership of which depends in the first instance upon whether, in relation to any of the land or waters in the area, there are registered native title claimants or registered native title bodies corporate or, in respect of any non-claimed or non-determined part of an area, any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body: s 24CD(2).
Where, as here, none of the foregoing is applicable, the "native title group" consists of the person or persons who claim to hold native title in relation to the land or waters of the relevant area: s 24CD(3)(a).
21 The statutory provision for the making of an area agreement in respect of an area even where there are no registered native title claimants or registered native title bodies corporate balances two of the main objects of the Native Title Act .
Out of an abundance of caution and evidencing the recognition by the Parliament of the importance of native title, it liberalises membership of a "native title group" in those circumstances to the extent of permitting those who do nothing more than claim to hold native title in relation to an area to have an opportunity to be heard and to have an opportunity to participate in decision-making.
In this fashion the provision can be seen as a benign endeavour, out of an abundance of caution, to preserve native title where it may exist, fulfilling the object in s 3(a) Native Title Act .
At the same time, by permitting the making in such circumstances of a consensual agreement the effect of which may be to extinguish native title by a future act done under the authority of a registered agreement, the Native Title Act serves the object in s 3(b) by establishing a way in which a future dealing concerning native title may proceed.
22 If an agreement makes provision for the extinguishment of native title rights and interests in relation to an area by their surrender to the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, the body politic concerned must be a party to the area agreement: s 24CD(5).
Even where an area agreement does not make such provision, it is still permissible, but not mandatory, for a body politic to be a party to an area agreement: ibid.
Any other person may be a party to an area agreement: s 24CD(6).
In this fashion, QWI was eligible to be a party to the Traveston Dam Agreement.
23 Providing the same are lawful, an area agreement may be made for such consideration or be subject to such conditions as the parties may agree: s 24CE Native Title Act .
24 Those wishing to make an area agreement may seek the assistance of the National Native Title Tribunal or of a recognised State or Territory body in negotiating the agreement: s 24CF Native Title Act .
25 Any party to an area agreement may, if all of the other parties to the agreement agree, apply to the Registrar for the agreement to be registered on the Register: s 24CG(1).
An application must be in writing, be accompanied by a copy of the agreement concerned and, materially for the present case, by virtue of s 24CG(3)(b) , be accompanied by a statement to the effect that:
 
(i) all reasonable efforts had been made (including by consulting all representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies for the area) to ensure that all persons who hold or may hold native title in relation to land or waters in the area covered by the agreement have been identified; and
 
(ii) all of the persons so identified had "authorised" the making of the agreement.
26 So far as "authorise" is concerned, a footnote to s 24CG(3)(b) refers the reader to s 251A of the Native Title Act .
Strictly, a footnote does not form part of an Act: s 13 Acts Interpretation Act .
Nonetheless, notwithstanding some infelicity in its drafting, it is tolerably clear that s 251A does give content to what amounts to "authorise" for the purposes of s 24CG(3)(b)(ii) of the Native Title Act .
Further, the better view is that, when s 24CG(3)(b)(ii) and s 251A are read together and in the context of the Native Title Act as a whole, they admit of circumstances in which authorisation by a majority of those who comprise a "native title group" is possible.
Put another way, in relation to authorisation of an area agreement, the word "all" in s 24CG(3)(b)(ii) does not, when read together with s 251A and in the context of the Native Title Act as a whole, mean that a single dissentient or non-participant will invariably have an ability to veto the authorisation of an agreement.
To reach that conclusion requires a detailed consideration of the legislation and prior authority, which I set out below in my discussion of the merits of the grounds of review.
27 The Registrar is permitted to give such assistance to a party as the Registrar considers reasonable to prepare an application and its accompanying material: s 24CG(4).
28 Upon receipt of an application, the Registrar is obliged to give notice of the making of the agreement to the Commonwealth Minister administering these provisions of the Native Title Act , the relevant State or Territory Minister if the agreement covers an area within the jurisdictional limits of a particular State or Territory, any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body and the local government body responsible for the area the subject of the agreement as well as to the public: s 24CH(1).
The required contents of such a notice are set out in s 24CH(2) and s 24CH(3).
Though in certain circumstances there is scope for the making of a formal objection to the registration of an area agreement (s 24CI) , these are not applicable in respect of the Traveston Dam Agreement.
29 Notice having been given, the Registrar, as already noted, must decide whether or not to register it on the Register: s 24CJ.
30 Section 24CL of the Native Title Act is applicable to the making of a registration decision in respect of a registration application containing a statement as mentioned in s 24CG(3)(b).
The application for the registration of the Traveston Dam Agreement is of that type.
In essence, s 24CL obliges the registration of an agreement if two conditions which it specifies have been met and forbids registration of they have not been met.
31 One of those conditions, described in s 24CL(2) as "the first condition", is not applicable in the circumstances of this case.
That is because there was no person who, in respect of the area the subject of the Traveston Dam Agreement, either at or after the end of the notice period was or became a registered native title claimant or a registered native title body corporate.
32 The other condition, described in s 24CL(3) as the "the second condition", is in the following terms:
 Second condition 
 
 (3) The second condition is that the Registrar considers that the requirements in paragraph 24CG(3)(b) (in summary, relating to identifying native title holders and ensuring that they have authorised the making of the agreement) have been met.
(Emphasis added).

 

I have given emphasis to the word "considers" in s 24CL(3) because it governs the nature of the second condition and has consequential ramifications in relation to the ready amenability to judicial review of the Delegate's registration decision insofar as it is grounded upon a conclusion that the second condition was satisfied in the case of the Traveston Dam Agreement.
33 As a matter of construction, the use of the verb "considers" in s 24CL(3) has the effect of placing that subsection within "that category of laws whose operation is made conditional upon the opinion or satisfaction as to certain matters of a designated authority or person, with the consequence that the merits of the matter are not examinable upon judicial review": The Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10 ; (1997) 187 CLR 297 , at 303.
As the High Court found in that case (ibid), the word "considers" was used to that end in the legislation then under consideration.
Later, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 650, [127] et seq, Gummow J, who had been a member of the Full Court which delivered the unanimous joint judgement in The Australian Heritage Commission Case , comprehensively analysed this type of statutory provision and the amenability of decisions made thereunder to judicial review.
In the course of that analysis, Gummow J drew attention (at 653-654, [136]) to the following remarks made by Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 , at 118-119 in relation to the judicial review of a "satisfaction" based decision:
 In all such cases the authority must act in good faith; it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously.
Moreover, a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account.
Even if none of these things can be established, the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it.
However, where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways, or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached.
After citing this passage, Gummow J added (at 654, [137]):
 
 
 137.
This passage is consistent with the proposition that, where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at the decision in question.
It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies, or, with other matters, goes to establish or to deny, that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way.

 

34 For completeness, it should be noted that, in deciding whether either the first or second conditions have been satisfied s 24CL(4) provides as follows:
 Matters to be taken into account 
 
 (4) In deciding whether the requirements have been met, the Registrar must take into account: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the statements in the application; and 
 (b) any information the Registrar is given on the matter by any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body or by any other body or person; and may, but need not, take into account any other matter or thing.

 
 
 Preliminary observations --- Scope of judicial review 
 
35 At the behest of QWI, there was some debate before me about whether it was part of the Registrar's function, when deciding under s 24CJ whether or not to register an agreement covered by an application, to make an assessment as to whether that agreement was indeed about one or more of the matters about an area specified in s 24CB or whether it contained a condition which was contrary to law (s 24CE(1)).
Referring for this purpose to s 24CL , QWI submitted that, "if certain conditions are satisfied, the Registrar must register the ILUA; if the conditions are not satisfied, the registrar must not register the agreement".
Thus, so QWI submitted, it was no part of the Registrar's function to decide whether what was presented for registration was an ILUA whereas the Applicants submitted to the contrary.
36 The error in QWI's submission is apparent on its face.
Section 24CJ empowers the Registrar to register an "agreement", i.e.
the particular type of ILUA known as an area agreement for which Subdiv C of Div 3 of Pt 2 of the Native Title Act provides, not any agreement.
Section 24CA is cast in imperative terms, "an agreement meeting the requirements of s 24CB - 24CE is an indigenous land use agreement " (emphasis in original).
Section 24CB of the Native Title Act is equally imperative --- "the agreement must be about one or more of the following matters in relation to an area".
So, too, are there imperative qualities in the parenthetical qualification in s 24CE(1) --- "The agreement may be given for any consideration, and subject to any conditions, agreed by the parties ( other than consideration or conditions that contravene any law )" (emphasis added)
 
37 For the purposes of Subdiv C an agreement will only be an ILUA if it meets the requirements of s 24CB - 24CE .
If it does not, the Registrar is both entitled and obliged not to register it on the Register, even if the conditions in s 24CL are otherwise met.
It is necessary to say "otherwise" because s 24CL itself is predicated on the application for registration being in respect of what is truly an "agreement".
The extent to which the Registrar has cause in a given case to investigate whether an agreement presented for registration meets the requirements of s 24CB - 24CE may depend upon whether and to what extent there is an assertion of non-compliance with those requirements.
The absence of any such assertion would not though thereby confer validity on an agreement which manifestly did not meet those requirements.
38 QWI likewise submitted that the Delegate's preliminary conclusion that the Traveston Dam Agreement was an ILUA for the purposes of the Subdiv C of Div 3 of Pt 3 of the Native Title Act was not amenable to review in the context of the present application under the AD(JR) Act for the review of the Delegate's registration decision.
It is true that the preliminary decision would not constitute a "decision" for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act, but it by no means follows that whether what is presented for registration is indeed an ILUA is immune from challenge upon the judicial review of the registration decision.
39 The Delegate was perfectly entitled, as a matter of good public administration, to reach a preliminary view about whether the agreement presented with the application was an ILUA, but the decision to register the same necessarily carried with it the maintenance of that preliminary view that the agreement was an ILUA.
For it was only such an agreement that the Delegate was empowered to register.
The only decision which falls to the Registrar (or a delegate) to make under Subdiv C of Div 3 of Pt 3 of the Native Title Act which has the requisite quality of statutory provision and affectation of legal rights to make it a "decision" for the purposes of the AD(JR) Act is a decision under s 24CJ as to whether or not to register an agreement on the Register: Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 221 CLR 99 , at 130-131, [89].
40 One permissible ground of review under s 5 of the AD(JR) Act is "that the decision was not authorized by the enactment in pursuance of which it was purported to be made" (s 5(1)(d)); another is "that the decision involved an error of law, whether or not the error appears on the record of the decision" (s 5(1)(f)); yet another is "that the decision was otherwise contrary to law" (s 5(1)(j)).
Each or any of these grounds would be apt as a ground for the challenging, on the basis that it was not in law an ILUA, of what purported to be a decision by the Registrar under s 24CJ to register an agreement.
41 A decision to register an agreement which was not an ILUA would be no decision under s 24CJ of the Native Title Act at all: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at 614-615, [51] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ.
Contrary to the submission of QWI, a challenge on such a ground is quite different to a challenge on an alleged error of law said to arise in the failure of an administrative decision-maker to find a fact, which is not a "jurisdictional fact", where such a finding was never sought before the decision-maker and where its materiality is asserted for the first time on "appeal" or judicial review.
Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1901 ; (2000) 106 FCR 157 at 175-176, [86] --- [90] and the authorities there discussed by Carr J highlight the difficulty of contending that such a failure is an error of law but such cases are quite different from one where the power to register is only exercisable if what is presented for registration is indeed an ILUA.
42 Further, that there may be other means of challenge to whether the Traveston Dam Agreement is an ILUA, e.g.
by way of an application to this Court for declaratory relief under s 39B(1A)(c) Judiciary Act 1903 , does not mean that it is not open for the Applicants in this proceeding to raise grounds going to whether the Traveston Dam Agreement is in law an ILUA.
No evidence grounds --- 1(a), 1(c), 1(e) and 1(f) 
 
43 One ground upon which an order of review may be sought under the AD(JR) Act is that there was no evidence or other material to justify the making of the decision: s 5(1)(h) AD(JR) Act.
Subsection 5(3) of the AD(JR) Act provides that:
 The ground specified in paragraph (1)(h) shall not be taken to be made out unless: 
 
 (a) the person who made the decision was required by law to reach that decision only if a particular matter was established, and there was no evidence or other material (including facts of which he or she was entitled to take notice) from which he or she could reasonably be satisfied that the matter was established; or 
 (b) the person who made the decision based the decision on the existence of a particular fact, and that fact did not exist.

 

44 As Weinberg J observed in Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 at 587, [577] , s 5(3)(a) of the AD(JR) Act "seems merely to restate the doctrine of jurisdictional fact".
Where the material "jurisdictional fact" is a state of administrative satisfaction that does not leave much scope for the operation of s 5(3)(a).
When one recalls the impact of the use of the word "considers" in relation to the "second condition" for which s 24CL provides and that it is evident from the Delegate's reasons that she "considered" that the second condition was satisfied, the "particular matter" to which s 5(3)(a) of the AD(JR) Act refers is, in that language of that paragraph, "established".
45 In Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia , Weinberg J also offered (148 FCR at 587, [578]), a succinct summary of the views expressed by Black CJ (with whom Spender and Gummow JJ agreed) in Curragh Queensland Coal Mining Ltd v Daniel [1992] FCA 44 ; (1992) 34 FCR 212 in what has become a seminal judgment as to the effect of s 5(3)(b) of the AD(JR) Act.
