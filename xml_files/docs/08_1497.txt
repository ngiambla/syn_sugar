 
1 The applicant, John Peter Lawrence, appeals pursuant to s 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ("the Administration Act ") against the decision of the respondent, the Commissioner of Taxation, to disallow his objection to an amended assessment of income tax for the year ended 30 June 2003, and to an assessment of penalty tax for that year.
The amended assessment was based upon determinations made by the Commissioner under Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ("the 1936 Act ").
Each such determination was made under s 177F(1)(a) of the 1936 Act , and was to the effect that a tax benefit, referable to an amount that, according to the Commissioner, had not been included in the applicant's assessable income, be so included for the 2003 year.
In each case the Commissioner further determined pursuant to s 177F(2) of the 1936 Act that the amount in question be deemed to be included in the assessable income of the applicant by virtue of s 44(1) of the 1936 Act .
The amounts which the Commissioner determined had not been included in the applicant's original assessment were the sums of $1,698,300 and $1,298,700.
2 The Commissioner's determinations under Part IVA were based upon s 177E(1) of the 1936 Act , to the detailed terms of which I shall refer later.
That provision deems what I shall for the moment describe as a dividend stripping scheme to be a scheme to which Part IVA applies.
The Commissioner took the view that, in relation to the 2003 year of income, companies controlled by the applicant had participated in dividend stripping schemes, or in schemes having substantially the effect of such schemes, the end result of which was that profits which were held for distribution by companies in which the applicant was the only shareholder were effectively converted into capital sums held by another company on trust for a class of discretionary beneficiaries which was confined to the applicant and members of his family.
I shall refer in greater detail to the transactions said to constitute the schemes below.
THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO THE TRANSACTIONS OF 8 JUNE 2003 
 
 3 At the relevant time, the applicant had, for many years, been engaged in various businesses as a company director.
His principal concern was in the wholesale and retail distribution and sale of plaster board and other plaster products for installation in the interiors of residential and commercial premises.
He had also been engaged in other businesses, such as timber milling, horse breeding, the assembly and sale of electronic components and the manufacture and sale of motor vehicle mufflers and exhausts.
In some cases, the applicant purchased businesses which had liquidity problems, and attempted to make them financially viable.
At the point of purchase, those businesses often were subject to what the applicant described as "significant debt and cash flow distress".
Sometimes, it took the applicant several years to turn a particular business around, while at other times he was unable to do so, and had to resell the business.
In his affidavit, the applicant said:
 In the course of conducting these numerous businesses, I ordinarily enter into supply and other contracts where I do assume significant personal liability.
Over the years, I have also had and continue to have an interest in significant real estate, both commercial and residential.
For the purpose of conducting these various businesses and holding these various properties, I have been a director and shareholder of numerous companies both as trading entities and as trustees of various trusts.
I have also held and continue to hold various assets in my personal name.
The applicant said that he knew his limits, and appreciated the need for obtaining and relying upon sound advice.
It was his practice to obtain advice from "suitably qualified and experienced lawyers and accountants".
He did so in order to obtain the best possible advice and assistance on all business transactions and financial matters, and to ensure that he had the most effective legal structure "to protect my assets from creditors and to maximize the profit of my businesses and investments".
It was always his intention and concern to comply with all legal and taxation obligations.
4 The main entity used by the applicant to conduct his various businesses was a discretionary trust known as the Lawrence Family Trust.
The trustee was Lauravale Pty Ltd ("Lauravale").
The applicant, members of his family and some of the companies in which he had an interest were among the class of discretionary beneficiaries of this trust.
One of the applicant's companies was Plaster Plus (Vic) Pty Ltd ("Plaster Plus"), of which the applicant had been the sole shareholder, and the only director, since 1998.
Plaster Plus had been incorporated for business purposes, but was not needed for those purposes and did not operate actively as a company until the 2002 financial year.
On 31 May 2002, the applicant and his wife borrowed the sum of $900,000 from Plaster Plus.
That sum was applied to reduce an existing liability to the Lawrence Family Trust.
On 1 June 2002, Lauravale nominated Plaster Plus as a general beneficiary of the Lawrence Family Trust.
On 29 June 2002, Lauravale decided to distribute income and capital gain in the total sum of $1,904,796 from the trust to Plaster Plus.
This amount constituted profit.
After various adjustments, Plaster Plus recorded a taxable profit of $1,919,574 for the year ended 30 June 2002.
Income tax was paid on that sum.
In the result, as at 30 June 2002, Plaster Plus had taxed but undistributed profits of $1,328,924.
The applicant said that he was advised that he had no need to distribute those profits in Plaster Plus, and that they could have been retained by Plaster Plus indefinitely.
5 In addition to his own accountant, Mr Hayes, the applicant and his companies received accounting and taxation advice from accountants based in Adelaide.
They introduced him to a Queensland solicitor, Ian Collie of the firm Cleary Hoare.
In early 2003 or thereabouts, Mr Collie contacted the applicant "to arrange a meeting in Melbourne to discuss a legal and financial transaction which he was recommending to some of his clients.
" The applicant later learned that the kind of transaction which Mr Collie had in mind was what was described as a "distributable surplus arrangement".
In early May 2003, the applicant, Mr Hayes and Mr Collie met at Mr Hayes' office at Glen Waverley.
Mr Collie gave verbal advice to the applicant, and discussed technical aspects of the proposed arrangement with Mr Hayes.
The applicant did not understand those aspects, and relied upon the expert opinion of Mr Collie and Mr Hayes as to the operation and efficacy of the arrangement, and as to the fact that it was lawful.
6 At the meeting at Glen Waverley, Mr Collie showed the applicant what the latter described as "a supportive opinion from a Brisbane based Queens Counsel about the operation and legality of distributable surplus arrangements"; as a result of which the applicant said that he was "doubly reassured".
An extract from the opinion of Senior Counsel obtained by Mr Collie, which may have been that shown to the applicant at the meeting at Glen Waverley, was set out in a letter later sent by Mr Collie to the applicant, and was in the following terms:
 What seems clear is that there must be something more than simply the payment of a dividend or other transfer of property from the company as the Commissioner's Rulings and Determinations acknowledge.
The creation of a dividend access share followed by the dividend to the holder of the share who enjoyed the whole of the dividend would not, in my Opinion, fall within the section.
Nor would the entry by a company into a transaction as a result of which its assets are diminished.
It is in my view an essential part of the concept of dividend stripping that there be some trafficking in the securities of the company.
Here there will be none.
It follows, in my view, that section 177E will have no application.
In the circumstances, the applicant instructed Mr Collie "to proceed with the necessary legal documents to give effect to and implement the distributable surplus arrangement ...." 
 
7 What was recommended to the applicant involved two discrete, but substantially identical, series of transactions.
The first related to Plaster Plus.
The second related to a company called Zinkris Pty Ltd ("Zinkris"), which was incorporated by Mr Collie on 5 June 2003, and of which the applicant became the sole shareholder and the only director on that day.
8 In both series of transactions, what was involved was a sequence of steps as set out in the following diagram, described as a "confidential transaction summary" and apparently prepared by the applicant's advisers:
 
The sums set out in this diagram referred to the transactions involved in the first series of transactions (that relating to Plaster Plus).
The sums for the second series (that relating to Zinkris) were different, but the steps were the same.
9 By reference to the diagram set out in the previous paragraph, in the first series of transactions the entity marked "G" was Plaster Plus, while the entity marked "C" was a company called Netscar Pty Ltd ("Netscar"), incorporated by Mr Collie on 30 May 2003.
In the second series of transactions, the entity marked "G" was Zinkris, while the entity marked "C" was a company called Windainty Pty Ltd ("Windainty"), incorporated by Mr Collie on 2 June 2003.
In both series, the entity marked "T" was a company called Clearmink Pty Ltd ("Clearmink"), incorporated by Mr Collie on 2 June 2003.
In both series, the entity marked "V" was Denburrow Pty Ltd ("Denburrow"), a company controlled by Cleary Hoare of which Mr Collie and Mr Michael James Patrick Hart, another member of that firm, were the directors.
10 The transactions by which the distributable surplus arrangements were implemented were carried out at the applicant's home at Richmond on 8 June 2003.
Although, at the point of incorporation, it may have been otherwise, by 8 June the applicant was the only director of all the relevant companies save Denburrow, and the only shareholder of all the relevant companies save Denburrow, Netscar and Windainty.
Changes in the shareholdings in Netscar and Windainty were central aspects of the first and second series of transactions, respectively, in ways to which I shall refer.
The transactions to be carried out on 8 June 2003 were, for each of the series, set out in a document headed "Meeting Times --- 8 June 2003".
For the first series, this required 15 steps to be taken between 10:30 am and 12:55 pm; for the second series, it required 15 steps to be taken between 1:15 pm and 3:40 pm.
11 Although not referred to in the schedules of meeting times for 8 June 2003, on that day two new discretionary trusts were settled by Mr Hart.
In each case, the settlement sum was $10.
The trustee was Clearmink, and the names of the trust were Clearmink No.
1 Trust and Clearmink No.
2 Trust.
The primary beneficiaries were the applicant and any spouse, de facto partner, widow, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, parents and grandparents of his.
There was no evidence as to the time, on 8 June, when these trusts were settled.
The fixing of the seal of Clearmink to each trust deed was witnessed by the applicant as director.
12 Immediately before the transactions on 8 June 2003, the share capital of each of Netscar and Windainty was structured as follows.
There were 900,000 ordinary shares.
There were eight classes of shares, of 10,000 shares each, identified as "A" Class to "H" Class.
There were 19,999 "J" Class redeemable preference shares, and there was one "K" Class redeemable preference subscriber share.
The only shareholder in each of Netscar and Windainty was Clearmink.
There is some confusion as to whether it held one share or two shares in each.
Australian Securities and Investment Commission extracts indicate that Clearmink held one share in each of Netscar and Windainty.
However, all the other evidence in the case, including the books of account of each relevant entity, suggest that two shares in each company were so held.
I shall proceed on that basis, and note that the shareholding in question, in each of Netscar and Windainty, was by way of ordinary shares.
There was no other issued share capital in Netscar or Windainty.
Before any of the steps were taken on 8 June 2003, there was no discrimination, in the constitutions of Netscar and Windainty, as between the participation rights of "A" Class and "B" Class shares on a return of capital.
THE PLASTER PLUS TRANSACTIONS 
 
 13 Dealing then with the first series of transactions done on 8 June 2003, it seems that the first document signed by the applicant was a resolution of himself as director of Netscar to call an extraordinary general meeting of members at 10:30 am on that day.
At 10:20 am, acting in his capacity as director of Clearmink, the applicant signed an acknowledgment of having received notice of that meeting.
The general meeting of Netscar was duly held at 10:30 am, the applicant being the only person present.
Two resolutions of substance were carried.
First, it was resolved to amend the constitution of Netscar in a number of ways, including by the insertion of a new clause 127(b) as follows:
 Upon a reduction of capital or winding up of the Company: .... 
 
 (b) The said "B" class shares shall as regards return of capital be entitled to the amount paid up on those shares and shall rank pari passu inter se with all other shares in the capital of the company and in the surplus assets and profits.

 
 
Secondly, it was resolved to consent to the conversion of the shareholding of Clearmink in Netscar to "A" Class shares.
The meeting closed at 10:45 am.
At 10:50 am, there was a meeting of the board of Netscar, constituted by the applicant, in which it was resolved to classify the Clearmink shareholding as "A" Class shares.
14 By a document headed "Application for Shares", addressed to the directors of Netscar and dated 8 June 2003, Denburrow applied for 1,700 "B" Class shares in Netscar, with a nominal value of $1,000 per share, payable as to $1 per share upon allotment and as to the balance upon call on seven days' notice.
There was no evidence as to the time, on 8 June, when that document was executed.
The document was accompanied by a bearer promissory note in the sum of $1,700.
At a meeting of the board of Netscar held at 11:00 am on 8 June 2003, attended only by the applicant as director, the receipt of the Denburrow share application was noted, and it was resolved to issue the shares on the basis set out in the application, and to accept the bearer promissory note in satisfaction of the amount payable at allotment.
The applicant signed a share certificate recording that Denburrow was the holder of 1,700 "B" Class shares in Netscar.
15 At 11:10 am on 8 June 2003, there was a further meeting of the board of Netscar, attended by the applicant as director.
The share allotment to Denburrow was noted.
It was resolved to make the call for the balance of the price of the "B" Class shares.
The applicant signed a "Notice of Call" addressed to Denburrow, in which the latter was required to pay the sum of $1,698,300, being the balance due in respect of Denburrow's "B" Class shares, on or before the expiration of eight days from the receipt of the notice.
16 At 11:30 am on 8 June 2003, a meeting of the board of Denburrow was held.
Messrs Collie and Hart attended as directors.
It was resolved to sell to Plaster Plus the 1,700 "B" Class shares "at market value, namely, $1,700".
It was noted that that sum represented the amount paid up on the shares, that the amount of $1,698,300 remained subject to call, and that the constitution of Netscar made Plaster Plus, as the new owner of the shares, liable for the call.
It was also noted that a call had in fact been made by Netscar.
The directors of Denburrow also resolved to accept delivery of a Plaster Plus promissory note in the sum of $1,700 as a payment for the shares.
That promissory note was in evidence, and was signed by the applicant on behalf of Plaster Plus on 8 June 2003, but there is no evidence as to the timing of that event.
The directors of Denburrow resolved also to deliver the Plaster Plus promissory note to Netscar "in satisfaction of the promissory note for the same amount previously drawn and delivered by [Denburrow] and to seek the return of that note".
17 At 11:40 am on 8 June 2003, there was a meeting of the board of Plaster Plus, attended by the applicant as director.
It was resolved to purchase from Denburrow the 1,700 "B" Class shares which the latter then held in Netscar "at market value, namely, $1,700.00 to be paid by delivery of a bearer promissory note for that amount".
It was noted that that sum represented the amount paid up on the shares, that the amount of $1,698,300 remained subject to call, and that the constitution of Netscar made Plaster Plus, as the new owner of the shares, liable for that call.
The making of the call by Netscar was noted.
18 On 8 June 2003, there was an agreement for sale made between Denburrow as vendor and Plaster Plus as purchaser with respect to the 1,700 "B" Class shares in Netscar.
In the recitals to that agreement, it was noted that the shares were paid up to $1 per share, with $1,698,300 at call, and that the holder of the shares was liable to meet the call.
Although there is no evidence as to the time at which this agreement was executed (in the case of Plaster Plus, by the applicant), as a matter of sequence it most probably came after the events referred to in the previous paragraph.
A share transfer was executed (the applicant signing on behalf of Plaster Plus) on the same day.
As director of Netscar, the applicant signed a share certificate stating that Plaster Plus was the holder of the 1,700 "B" Class shares.
19 The next thing that appears to have happened on 8 June 2003 was the signing of a promissory note addressed to Netscar by the applicant on behalf of Plaster Plus.
By it, Plaster Plus promised to pay Netscar the sum of $1,698,300 on presentation of the note.
At 11:50 am on 8 June, there was a meeting of the board of Netscar, attended by the applicant as director.
It was noted that Plaster Plus, which had acquired the shares originally issued to Denburrow, had delivered an "on demand" promissory note to meet the call.
It was resolved to accept the promissory note as meeting the call.
It was also resolved to accept from Denburrow the delivery of the Plaster Plus bearer promissory note in the sum of $1,700 in satisfaction of the promissory note previously drawn and delivered by Denburrow for that amount, and to return the latter to the drawer.
20 At this point, the shareholding in Netscar was as follows.
Clearmink held the only two "A" Class shares issued.
It held them as trustee of the Clearmink No.
1 Trust.
Plaster Plus held the 1,700 "B" Class shares.
It had acquired them from Denburrow, to whom they had originally been issued.
As to $1 per share, it had paid Denburrow by way of a bearer promissory note which was subsequently delivered to Netscar.
As to $999 per share, it had paid for them by an "on demand" promissory note addressed to Netscar itself.
21 At 12:10 pm on 8 June 2003, the board of Netscar, constituted by the applicant as director, resolved to call an extraordinary general meeting at 12:45 pm that day.
It was proposed to amend to constitution of Netscar by replacing clause 127(b), set out in par 13 above, with the following:
 The said "B" shares shall as regards return of capital be entitled only to $1.00 per share but shall not carry the right to any further participation in any surplus assets or profits of the company.
The notice was received by each of Clearmink and Plaster Plus at 12:20 pm.
The applicant, as the only shareholder in Plaster Plus, signed a consent to that amendment.
At 12:30 pm, the board of Plaster Plus, constituted by the applicant as director, noted that consent, and resolved to consent to the amendment.
Plaster Plus then executed a formal form of consent to the amendment, signed by the applicant.
At 12:40 pm on 8 June 2003, the board of Clearmink, constituted by the applicant as director, resolved to consent to the proposed amendment to the constitution of Netscar.
A formal form of consent was executed by Clearmink, signed by the applicant.
At 12:45 pm on 8 June 2003, an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of Netscar was held.
Clearmink and Plaster Plus were both present, by their director, the applicant, in each case.
It was unanimously resolved to amend the constitution of Netscar in the form proposed in the notice of meeting.
22 At some time on 8 June 2003, presumably subsequent to the amendments just mentioned, the board of Netscar, constituted by the applicant as director, resolved to advance the sum of $1,698,300 to Clearmink, as trustee for the Clearmink No.
1 Trust, by way of loan.
This was to be done, and was in fact done, by the delivery of a bearer promissory note in that sum.
The note was executed by the applicant as director of Netscar; and the receipt of the note by Clearmink was acknowledged by a receipt signed by the applicant as director of that company.
23 The accounts for the Clearmink No.
1 Trust as at 30 June 2003 were in evidence.
On the balance sheet, the trust is shown to have current assets of $1,700,008.
The $8 was cash (presumably the difference between the settlement sum of $10 and the cost of buying two $1 ordinary shares in Netscar).
The remaining current assets, $1,700,000, were said to be "promissory note outstanding".
On the evidence, the only promissory note that had been delivered to Clearmink, to be held for the Clearmink No.
1 Trust, was the Netscar promissory note (by way of loan) in the sum of $1,698,300.
The balance sheet makes no reference to a promissory note in that sum.
Rather, as I have indicated, it does refer to a promissory note in the sum of $1,700,000 as to the existence of which there is no other evidence.
There is in evidence a letter from Mr Collie to the applicant dated 22 July 2003, in which the former referred to an "earlier letter" (which is not in evidence) and said that "[p]ending cash flow between the various entities, the transaction can be recorded in accordance with ... [a document provided under separate cover --- not in evidence] namely...":
 
 
 3.1 Plaster Plus (Vic) Pty Ltd 
 
 
 
 
 3.1.1 Share purchase 
 
 
 
 
 - debit assets $1,700.00
 - credit loan from Netscar Pty Ltd $1,700.00
 
 
 
 
 
 3.1.2 Payment of Call 
 
 
 
 
 - debit assets $1,698,300.00
 - credit loan from Netscar Pty Ltd $1,698,300.00
 
 
2.2 Netscar Pty Ltd 2.2.1 Loan to Plaster Plus (Vic) Pty Ltd - debit assets $1,700,000.00 - credit issued capital $1,700,000.00 2.2.2 Loan to Clearmink Pty Ltd - debit assets $1,700,000.00 - credit loans $1,700,000.00 2.3 Clearmink Pty Ltd 2.3.1 Loan to "shareholder/associates" - debit assets $1,700,000.00 - credit loan to Netscar Pty Ltd $1,700,000.00 
It is possible that the entries on the balance sheet of the Clearmink No.
1 Trust reflect the advice so tendered by Mr Collie.
They do not appear to reflect what actually occurred on 8 June 2003.
If they reflect other transactions carried on before 30 June 2003 but not on 8 June, there is no other evidence of them; and, if they did, it would leave the actual promissory note delivered by Netscar to Clearmink unrepresented on the balance sheet.
24 The balance sheet of Clearmink No.
1 Trust showed non-current assets of $3,028,926, made up as follows.
First, there was the sum of $1,700,002.
The $2 represented the cost value of the shares held by the trust in Netscar.
The $1,700,000 was said to be "provision for increase in value".
It was common ground, and I would find, that this entry was supposed to represent the increase in value in Clearmink's two shares in Netscar, brought about by the alteration of the participation rights of the "B" class shareholders effected by the substitution of cl 127(b) of the constitution on 8 June 2003.
Again, there was no explanation as to why the sum was $1,700,000, rather than $1,698,300, since the sum of $1,700 would still have been due to the "B" class shareholders on liquidation.
However that minor anomaly may be, this entry on the balance sheet of the Clearmink No.
1 Trust relates to a central feature of the first series of transactions on 8 June; the result of the alteration of the participation rights of "B" class shareholders in Netscar was that the "A" class shareholder, Clearmink, received a gain by way of a substantial increase in the value of the two shares which it held.
25 Next, the non-current assets of the trust as at 30 June 2003 included the sum of $1,328,924, which had two components.
The first was a loan to Lauravale in the sum of $428,924, and the second was a loan to the applicant and his wife in the sum of $900,000.
Save for these accounts, there was no direct evidence of the making of those loans.
However, it was common ground that I should treat the loans as existing as at 30 June 2003.
Additionally, I would note two further things about these loans.
First, taken together, they correspond exactly to the accumulated profits of Plaster Plus as at 30 June 2002 (and, I infer, as at 7 June 2003).
Secondly, the loan to the applicant and his wife is in the same amount as the loan which had been advanced to them by Plaster Plus in the 2002 year.
Later in these reasons (see par 70 below) I refer to evidence from which it should be inferred that the 2002 loan was repaid to Plaster Plus on 8 June 2003.
It was submitted on behalf of the Commissioner that the loan of $900,000 from Clearmink put the applicant and his wife in funds such as permitted the repayment of the 2002 loan.
I accept that submission.
It follows, and I would infer, that the Clearmink loan was made to the applicant and his wife no later than, and most probably on, 8 June 2003.
26 The balance sheet for Clearmink No.
1 Trust as at 30 June 2003 showed also current liabilities of $1,700,000.
This was said to be a loan from Netscar.
I note that, on the evidence, Netscar had lent the trust a sum of $1,698,300, and that the unexplained variation in the liability section of the balance sheet from this sum corresponds with, and balances, the apparent misstatement as to the face value of the Netscar promissory note referred to as one of the current assets of the trust.
27 As non-current liabilities, the balance sheet showed the sum of $1,328,924.
This was said to be a non-secured loan from Plaster Plus.
I note that this sum corresponds precisely with the total of the loan said to be made by the trust to the applicant and his wife, and to Lauravale, as described above.
28 The accounts for the Clearmink No.
1 Trust also set out the "trust capital and reserves".
This amounted to the sum of $1,700,010, of which $10 was the settlement sum and $1,700,000 was a capital profit reserve, constituted by the provision for the increase in value of the two shares held in Netscar.
29 In the accounts for Plaster Plus for the year ended 30 June 2003, an extraordinary loss item of $1,698,300 was shown in the profit and loss statement.
This was said to be a provision for the diminution in value of the shares held in Netscar.
When set against the retained profits at the beginning of that financial year, this provision had the effect of causing Plaster Plus to record a loss of $332,079 in that year.
30 In its balance sheet as at 30 June 2003, Plaster Plus showed the value of its shareholding in Netscar at $1,700,000, less provision for diminution in value in the amount of $1,698,000.
The value of the shareholding was, therefore, $1,700.
Also recorded as a non-current asset was the sum of $1,382,206, said to be an unsecured loan to the Clearmink No.
1 Trust.
At the same time, the accounts showed that non-current assets which had existed on 30 June 2002 no longer existed, namely, a loan to Lauravale in the sum of $1,004,796 and the loan to the applicant and his wife in the sum of $900,000 mentioned in par 25 above.
THE ZINKRIS TRANSACTIONS 
 
 31 Turning now to the second series of transactions done on 8 June 2003, a preliminary to those transactions was the nomination, on 5 June 2003, of Zinkris as a general beneficiary of the Lawrence Family Trust.
It will be recalled that Zinkris itself was incorporated only on that day.
It seems that Zinkris received no income between then and 8 June 2003.
However, on 29 June 2003 the Lawrence Family Trust distributed income to Zinkris in the amount of $1,762,826.
This was shown as operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2003.
Tax was calculated at $632,827, leaving Zinkris with taxed, undistributed profits of $1,129,999 as at that date.
It is apparent that the transactions of 8 June 2003 were based on an anticipation that profits of about that order would be lying in Zinkris as at 30 June 2003.
I should add that, as in the case of Plaster Plus, the applicant said that he had been advised that he had no need to distribute those profits in Zinkris, and that they could have been retained by Zinkris indefinitely.
32 On 8 June 2003, as director of Windainty, the applicant resolved to call an extraordinary general meeting of members at 1:15 pm on that day and, in his capacity as director of Clearmink, he signed an acknowledgement of having received notice of that meeting.
The general meeting of Windainty was duly held at 1:15 pm, the applicant being the only person present.
Resolutions in the same terms as those passed by the meeting of Plaster Plus at 10:30 am that day were carried (see par 13 above).
The meeting closed at 1:30 pm.
At 1:35 pm, there was a meeting of the board of Windainty, constituted by the applicant, in which it was resolved to classify the Clearmink shareholding as "A" Class shares.
33 There followed a series of transactions closely corresponding to those set out in par 14 above, the only differences being that Windainty, rather than Netscar, was the company concerned and that 1,300, rather than 1,700, "B" Class shares were involved.
Then (at 1:55 pm) the board of Windainty, constituted by the applicant, resolved to call for the balance of the price of "B" Class shares, and a call in those terms was executed and transmitted to Denburrow at 2:05 pm.
The sum called for was $1,298,700, being the difference between the face value of the 1,300 "B" Class shares ($1.3 m) and the amount already paid by Denburrow ($1,300).
34 At 2:15 pm on 8 June 2003, a meeting of the board of Denburrow was held.
Messrs Collie and Hart attended as directors.
It was resolved to sell to Zinkris the 1,300 "B" Class shares "at market value, namely, $1,300.00".
It was noted that that sum represented the amount paid up on the shares, that the amount of $1,298,700 remained subject to call, and that the constitution of Windainty made Zinkris, as the new owner of the shares, liable for the call.
It was also noted that a call had in fact been made by Windainty.
The directors of Denburrow also resolved to accept delivery of a Zinkris promissory note in the sum of $1,300 as payment for the shares.
That promissory note was in evidence, and was signed by the applicant on behalf of Zinkris on 8 June 2003, but there is no evidence as the timing of that event.
The directors of Denburrow resolved also to deliver the Zinkris promissory note to Windainty "in satisfaction of the promissory note for the same amount previously drawn and delivered by [Denburrow] and to seek the return of that note".
At 2:25 pm, there was a meeting of the board of Zinkris, attended by the applicant as director.
Business was transacted which corresponded with that set out in par 17 above, mutatis mutandis .
Likewise, there was an agreement for the sale of shares between Denburrow and Zinkris which corresponded to that referred to in par 18 above.
35 Next, the applicant, acting as director of Zinkris, signed a promissory note in favour of Windainty in the sum of $1,298,700.
At 2:35 pm on 8 June, there was a meeting of the board of Windainty, attended by the applicant as director.
It was noted that Zinkris, which had acquired the shares originally issued to Denburrow, had delivered an "on demand" promissory note to meet the call.
It was resolved to accept the promissory note as meeting the call.
It was also resolved to accept from Denburrow the delivery of the Zinkris bearer promissory note in the sum of $1,300 in satisfaction of the promissory note previously drawn and delivered by Denburrow for that amount, and to return the latter to the drawer.
36 At this point, the shareholding in Windainty was as follows.
Clearmink held the only two "A" Class shares issued.
It held them as trustee for the Clearmink No.
2 Trust.
Zinkris held the 1,300 "B" Class shares.
It had acquired them from Denburrow, to whom they had originally been issued.
As to $1 per share, it had paid Denburrow by way of a Denburrow promissory note, which was subsequently delivered to Windainty.
As to $999 per share, it had paid for them by an "on demand" promissory note addressed to Windainty itself.
37 At 2:55 pm on 8 June 2003, the board of Windainty, constituted by the applicant as director, resolved to call an extraordinary general meeting at 3:30 pm that day.
It was proposed to amend the constitution of Windainty by replacing Clause 127(b) with a provision in the same terms as I have set out at par 21 above in the case of Netscar.
There followed a series of transactions which corresponded, mutatis mutandis , with those set out in par 21 above in the case of Plaster Plus and Netscar.
As in the case of Netscar, the constitution of Windainty was amended to limit the participation rights of the holders of "B" Class shares to $1 per share on a return of capital.
38 Finally on 8 June 2003 (or so it seems) the board of Windainty, constituted by the applicant, resolved to advance the sum of $1,298,700 to Clearmink, as trustee for the Clearmink No.
2 Trust, by way of loan.
This was done by the delivery of a bearer promissory note in that sum, executed by the applicant as director of Windainty, and acknowledged by him as director of Clearmink.
39 The accounts for the Clearmink No.
2 Trust as at 30 June 2003 were in evidence.
On the balance sheet, the trust is shown to have current assets of $1,300,008.
The $8 was cash, presumably the difference between the settlement sum of $10 and the cost of buying two $1 ordinary shares in Windainty.
The remaining current assets, $1,300,000 were said to be "promissory note outstanding".
On the evidence, the only promissory note that had been delivered to Clearmink, to be held for the Clearmink No.
2 Trust, was the Windainty promissory note (by way of loan) in the sum of $1,298,700.
The balance sheet makes no reference to a promissory note in that sum.
Rather, as I have indicated, it does refer to a promissory note in the sum of $1,300,000 as to the existence of which there is no other evidence.
No such correspondence as is referred to in par 23 above in relation to the Clearmink No.
1 Trust was in evidence in relation to the Clearmink No.
2 Trust.
40 The balance sheet of the Clearmink No.
2 Trust showed non-current assets of $2,952,496, made up as follows.
First, there was the sum of $1,300,002.
The $2 represented the cost value of the shares held by the trust in Windainty.
The $1,300,000 was said to be "provision for increase in value".
It was common ground, and I would find, that this entry was supposed to represented the increase in value in Clearmink's two shares in Windainty, brought about by the alteration of the participation rights of the "B" Class shareholders effected by the substitution of clause 127(b) of the constitution on 8 June 2003.
Again, there was no explanation as to why the sum was $1,300,000, rather than $1,298,700, since the sum of $1,300,000 would still have been due to the "B" Class shareholders on liquidation.
However that minor anomaly may be, this entry on the balance of the Clearmink No.
2 Trust relates to a central feature of the second series of transactions on 8 June; the result of the alteration of the participation rights of "B" Class shareholders in Windainty was that the "A" Class shareholder, Clearmink, received a gain by way of a substantial increase in the value of the two shares which it held.
41 Next, the non-current assets of the trust as at 30 June 2003 included the sum of $1,652,494, which had two components.
The first was a loan to Lauravale in the sum of $952,494, and the second was a loan to the applicant and his wife in the sum of $700,000.
Save for these accounts, there was no direct evidence of the making of those loans.
However, it was common ground that I should treat the loans as existing as at 30 June 2003.
42 The balance sheet for Clearmink No.
2 Trust as at 30 June 2003 showed also current liabilities of $1,300,000.
This was said to be a loan from Windainty.
I note that, on the evidence, Windainty had lent the trust a sum of $1,298,700, and that the unexplained variation in the liability section of the balance sheet from this sum corresponds with, and balances, the apparent misstatement as to the face value of the Windainty promissory note referred to as one of the current assets of the trust.
43 As non-current liabilities, the balance sheet showed the sum of $1,652,494.
This was said to be a non-secured loan from Zinkris.
I note that this sum corresponds precisely with the total of the loan said to be made by the trust to the applicant and his wife, and to Lauravale, as described above.
44 The accounts for the Clearmink No.
2 Trust also set out the "trust capital and reserves".
This amounted to the sum of $1,300,010 of which $10 was the settlement sum and $1,300,000 was capital profit reserve, constituted by the provision for the increase in the value of the two shares held in Windainty.
45 In the accounts for Zinkris for the year ended 30 June 2003, an extraordinary loss item of $1,298,700 was shown in the profit and loss statement.
This was said to be a provision for the diminution in value of the shares held in Windainty.
When set against the profits earned by way of distribution from Lauravale as described in par 31 above, this provision had the effect of causing Zinkris to record a loss of $168,701 in that year.
46 In its balance sheet as at 30 June 2003, Zinkris showed the value of its shareholding in Windainty at $1,300,000 less a provision for diminution in value in the amount of $1,298,700.
The value of the shareholding was, therefore, $1,300.
Also recorded as a non-current asset was the sum of $1,762,826, said to be an unsecured loan to the Clearmink No.
2 Trust .
THE S 177F DETERMINATIONS AND THE AMENDED ASSESSMENTS 
 
47 The applicant returned a total income of $40,996 for the year ended 30 June 2003.
It is tolerably clear that no part of that income represented any distribution to the applicant by Plaster Plus or Zinkris.
An assessment issued on 9 March 2004 which was based upon that income as so returned.
In May 2005, the applicant received a notice under s 264 of the 1936 Act , requiring him to attend for examination and to produce certain documents.
I shall refer further to that notice in due course.
The notice appears to have prompted a letter which the applicant sent to the Commissioner on 12 May 2005, and in which he disclosed the details of the Plaster Plus and Zinkris transactions to which I have referred above.
After the applicant had attended for examination under s 264 , and after further correspondence passing between his advisers and the Commissioner, the latter made the determinations, and issued the amended assessments, to which I next refer.
48 In making his first determination under Part IVA of the 1936 Act , the Commissioner took the view that there was a scheme, within the meaning of the definition of that word in s 177A , involving the applicant, Plaster Plus, Netscar, Denburrow and Clearmink.
He took the view that the scheme was by way of, or in the nature of, dividend stripping, or that it at least had substantially the effect of such a scheme, within the meaning of s 177E(1)(a) of the 1936 Act .
He considered that the diminution in the value of the shares in Netscar held by Plaster Plus constituted a disposal of property by Plaster Plus within the meaning of s 177E(2)(d) of the 1936 Act .
He formed the opinion that that disposal represented a distribution of the profits of Plaster Plus within the meaning of s 177E(1)(b) of the 1936 Act .
The Commissioner also considered that, if Plaster Plus had paid a dividend out of profits equal to the amount represented by the diminution in value of its shareholding in Netscar, the amount of that distribution would have been, or might reasonably be expected to have been, included in the assessable income of the applicant within the meaning of s 177E(1)(c) of the 1936 Act .
In the circumstances, the applicant was taken to have obtained a tax benefit for the purposes of s 177F.
The Commissioner determined that $1,698,300 was the amount of profits of Plaster Plus which was represented by the diminution in the value of the Plaster Plus shareholding in Netscar.
49 In making his second determination under Part IVA of the 1936 Act , the Commissioner took the view that there was a scheme, within the meaning of the definition of that word in s 177A , involving the applicant, Zinkris, Windainty, Denburrow and Clearmink.
He took the view that the scheme was by way of, or in the nature of, dividend stripping, or that it at least had substantially the effect of such a scheme, within the meaning of s 177E(1)(a) of the 1936 Act .
He considered that the diminution in the value of the shares in Windainty held by Zinkris constituted a disposal of property by Zinkris within the meaning of s 177E(2)(d) of the 1936 Act .
He formed the opinion that that disposal represented a distribution of the profits of Zinkris within the meaning of s 177E(1)(b) of the 1936 Act .
The Commissioner also considered that, if Zinkris had paid a dividend out of profits equal to the amount represented by the diminution in value of its shareholding in Windainty, the amount of that distribution would have been, or might reasonably be expected to have been, included in the assessable income of the applicant within the meaning of s 177E(1)(c) of the 1936 Act .
In the circumstances, the applicant was taken to have obtained a tax benefit for the purposes of s 177F.
The Commissioner determined that $1,298,700 was the amount of profits of Zinkris which was represented by the diminution in the value of the Zinkris shareholding in Windainty.
50 By reason of the determinations to which I have referred, the Commissioner issued a Notice of Amended Assessment on 25 October 2007.
That notice disclosed an increase in the applicant's taxable income of $2,997,000, compared with the original assessment issued on 9 March 2004.
The additional tax required to be paid under the amended assessment was $1,451,514.32.
51 The Commissioner also imposed an administrative penalty under subdiv 284-C of Div 284 of Part 4 - 25 of Sched 1 to the Administration Act .
That penalty was calculated at 50% of the "scheme shortfall amount" (ie 50% of $1,451,514.32) pursuant to s 284-160(a)(i) of that Schedule, reduced by 20% pursuant to s 284-225(1) of the Schedule, on the basis that the applicant had disclosed the details of the scheme after the Commissioner told him that a tax audit was to be conducted of his financial affairs.
In the result, the penalty imposed was $580,605.70.
THE LEGISLATION 
 
52 It is now necessary to refer to the provisions of Part IVA of the 1936 Act by reference to which this proceeding must be determined.
Central to the operation of that Part is s 177F , subsection (1) of which relevantly provides:
 Where a tax benefit has been obtained, or would but for this section be obtained, by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme to which this Part applies, the Commissioner may: 
 
 (a) in the case of a tax benefit that is referable to an amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of a year of income ---determine that the whole or a part of that amount shall be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of that year of income; 
 
... and, where the Commissioner makes such a determination, he shall take such action as he considers necessary to give effect to that determination.
By s 177A(1) , a "scheme" is defined as:
 
 
 (a) any agreement, arrangement, understanding, promise or undertaking, whether express or implied and whether or not enforceable, or intended to be enforceable, by legal proceedings; and
 (b) any scheme, plan, proposal, action, course of action or course of conduct.

 
 
Specifically in relation to dividend stripping, s 177E provides as follows:
 (1) Where: (a) as a result of a scheme that is, in relation to a company: (i) a scheme by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping; or (ii) a scheme having substantially the effect of a scheme by way of or in the nature of a dividend stripping; any property of the company is disposed of; 
 
 
 (b) in the opinion of the Commissioner, the disposal of that property represents, in whole or in part, a distribution (whether to a shareholder or another person) of profits of the company (whether of the accounting period in which the disposal occurred or of any earlier or later accounting period);
 (c) if, immediately before the scheme was entered into, the company had paid a dividend out of profits of an amount equal to the amount determined by the Commissioner to be the amount of profits the distribution of which is, in his opinion, represented by the disposal of the property referred to in paragraph (a), an amount (in this subsection referred to as the notional amount ) would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included, by reason of the payment of that dividend, in the assessable income of a taxpayer of a year of income; and
 (d) the scheme has been or is entered into after 27 May 1981, whether in Australia or outside Australia, 
 
 
 the following provisions have effect: 
 
 
 (e) the scheme shall be taken to be a scheme to which this Part applies;
 (f) for the purposes of section 177F , the taxpayer shall be taken to have obtained a tax benefit in connection with the scheme that is referable to the notional amount not being included in the assessable income of the taxpayer of the year of income; and
 (g) the amount of that tax benefit shall be taken to be the notional amount.

 
 
 
 
 (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a reference in that subsection to the disposal of property of a company shall be read as including a reference to: 
 
 (a) the payment of a dividend by the company; 
 
 
 (b) the making of a loan by the company (whether or not it is intended or likely that the loan will be repaid); 
 
 
 (c) a bailment of property by the company; and 
 
 
 (d) any transaction having the effect, directly or indirectly, of diminishing the value of any property of the company.

 
 
(2A) This section: 
 
 
 (a) applies to a non-share equity interest in the same way as it applies to a share; and
 (b) applies to an equity holder in the same way as it applies to a shareholder; and
 (c) applies to a non-share dividend in the same way as it applies to a dividend.

 
 
 
 
 (3) In this section, property includes a chose in action and also includes any estate, interest, right or power, whether at law or in equity, in or over property.

 
 THE APPLICANT'S CASE 
 
53 It was common ground that the resolutions of the general meetings of members of Netscar (at 12:45 pm on 8 June 2003), and of Windainty (at 3:30 pm on that day) by which the right of "B" Class shareholders to participate in a return of capital was limited to $1 per share, were transactions having the effect of diminishing the value of Plaster Plus's shareholding in Netscar, and of Zinkris's shareholding in Windainty, and were therefore disposals of property for the purposes of s 177E.
Neither did the applicant resist the proposition that at least what occurred at Richmond on 8 June 2003 was a "scheme" for presently relevant purposes, or that diminutions in the value of that shareholding resulted from that scheme.
The applicant also accepted that the diminutions were in the sums of $1,698,300 and $1,298,700 respectively (as, indeed, the annual accounts of Plaster Plus and Zinkris indicated).
Since those sums were the amounts determined by the Commissioner to be the amounts of profits the distribution of which, in his opinion, represented those diminutions in value, and since the applicant was the only shareholder in each of Plaster Plus and Zinkris, it would seem to be clear that, had Plaster Plus and Zinkris paid dividends out of profits of those amounts respectively, they might reasonably be expected to have been included in the assessable income of the applicant, as required by par (c) of subs (1).
54 The applicant challenged the Commissioner's determination under s 177F in the following respects:
 
1.
While it was accepted that the series of transactions carried out on 8 June 2003 fell within the definition of "scheme" in s 177A , it was contended that the schemes did not extend beyond the transactions by which the participation rights of the "B" class shareholders in Netscar and Zinkris were diminished.
In particular, it was said that the loans by the Clearmink No.
1 and No.
2 Trusts to the applicant, his wife and Lauravale were not part of the scheme.
2.
It was contended that the schemes were not by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping, and did not have substantially the effect of schemes which were by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping, within the meaning of par (a) of s 177E(1) of the 1936 Act .
3.
It was contended that, to the extent that the schemes involved disposals of property within the meaning of s 177E , those disposals did not represent distributions of the profits of Plaster Plus or Zinkris; or at least not a distribution to the applicant.
It was not sufficient, it was said, for Clearmink to have benefited from the disposals.
4.
It was contended that s 177E simply did not apply in the circumstances of the present case, since that section was a "provision of last resort".
As I understand it, this contention was based upon the proposition that various other provisions of the legislation expressly permit a taxpayer to take steps of the kind taken by the applicant in the present case, and thereby contemplate that the taxpayer may secure access to the profits of a company in tax-free form.
Section 177E , therefore, should not be permitted an operation which would cut across the apparent intention of those other provisions.
THE SCOPE OF THE SCHEMES 
 
55 As to the scope of the schemes, counsel for the applicant relied upon Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 as authority for the proposition that, in a Pt IVA case, the scheme must be identified in a way that gives it a sensible relation to the tax benefits sought to be obtained, and to its dominant purpose: see 217 CLR at 223 [5] and 225 [9].
I accept that submission at the general level, but note that Hart was, relevantly, concerned with the concept of a tax benefit as dealt with in s 177C and with purpose as dealt with in s 177D.
In the case of s 177E , Pt IVA applies because the requirements of pars (a)-(d) of subs (1) have been satisfied in a particular case, not because of the operation of s 177D.
Likewise, under s 177E the taxpayer is taken to have obtained a tax benefit because of the operation of par (f), without the need for recourse to s 177C.
Counsel for the applicant recognised these points of detailed departure from the situation in Hart , but submitted that the observations in Hart had reference to s 177E in a way that required the scheme to be confined to the transactions which, according to the Commissioner, were by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping, or which were said to have that effect.
In particular, he submitted that a scheme of the kind contemplated by s 177E could not include any transactions which occurred later in time than the disposal of property by reference to which subs (1) operates, and that any such later transactions had to be ignored.
Specifically in the present case, according to counsel for the applicant, nothing later than the resolutions of the general meetings of Netscar and Windainty by which the participation rights of holders of "B" Class shares were altered could be treated as part of the schemes.
56 Although little turns on it in the facts of the present case, I am inclined to think that counsel's submission fails to recognise the distinction between the operation of s 177E , on the one hand, and the characterisation of the scheme which, as at least one of its results, produces a disposal of property of the kind to which the section refers, on the other.
Drawing from the definition of "scheme" in s 177A , the latter question will be whether there was any scheme, plan, proposal etc (including a unilateral one --- see s 177A(3)) which was by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping, or which substantially had that effect.
In answering this question, the court should not, in my view, turn a Nelsonian eye to facts, circumstances or transactions which have the capacity to throw light on the matter merely because they post-date the disposal of property by reference to which the operation of the section is complete.
For one thing, s 177E requires only that the disposal of property be a result of the putative scheme: it may be that the plan, proposal etc in question involves, in a particular case, the doing of things after the disposal of property is complete.
For another thing, as will appear presently, the concept of "dividend stripping" is not defined in the 1936 Act , and, in one of its aspects, involves a consideration of purpose.
There is, in my view, no warrant in s 177E for the a priori exclusion of any facts or events, before or after the actual disposal by reference to which subs (1) operates, from that consideration.
57 Consistently with what I take to have been the High Court's injunction in Hart , I do not propose to divorce my identification of the schemes in the present case from the matter of dividend stripping itself.
Whether there were schemes which were by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping, or which had substantially that effect, should, in my view, be approached as a composite inquiry in the context of which all proven facts having a rational tendency to provide the answer should be placed on the table for such assistance as they provide.
58 As I have said, the applicant accepted that there were schemes in the present case but contended that they involved no transactions beyond those by which the participation rights of the "B" Class shareholders in Netscar and Windainty were altered.
As will appear below, I consider that the matters arising under s 177E can be decided consistently with that contention and that, for that reason, probably little turns on whether the schemes went beyond those transactions or not.
However, to be faithful to the facts as they appear in the evidence, I would have to note that (in the case of the Plaster Plus transactions) the loans from Clearmink to the applicant and his wife ($900,000) and to Lauravale ($428,924) were related closely to the events of 8 June 2003 both in time and in purpose.
As to timing, I have held above that the $900,000 loan was made on or very shortly before 8 June 2003.
There was no evidence of the actual timing of the $428,924 loan, but it occurred before 30 June 2003.
The sum of these two loans corresponded precisely with the accumulated, undistributed, profits of Plaster Plus as at 30 June 2002.
In the case of the Zinkris transactions, the loans from Clearmink to the applicant and his wife ($700,000) and to Lauravale ($952,494) could only have been made on 8 June 2003, or between then and 30 June 2003.
The applicant, on whom the onus lay, gave no evidence on any of these matters.
All these loans were, I infer, the ones to be made by the "trustee of new trust" (ie Clearmink) as shown on the schematic representation in the confidential transaction summary --- see par 8 above.
As there shown, the loans had every appearance of being part of the "scheme, plan, proposal [etc]" (to use the words of the definition of "scheme" in s 177A) implemented in each of the series of transactions in the present case.
BY WAY OF OR IN THE NATURE OF DIVIDEND STRIPPING 
 
59 I turn next to the applicant's second main challenge to the Commissioner's determinations.
In defending the determinations, counsel for the Commissioner relied upon both limbs of par (a) of s 177E(1) of the 1936 Act .
They submitted that the schemes (however they might be defined) were by way of, or in the nature of, dividend stripping or, alternatively, had substantially the effect of such a scheme.
Counsel for the applicant submitted that the schemes in the present case fell into neither category.
60 The term "dividend stripping" is not defined in the 1936 Act .
The meaning of the term as used in s 177E was the subject of detailed consideration by Hill J in CPH Property Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 88 FCR 21 and by each of the Full Court and the High Court when that case went on appeal: see Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Press Holdings Limited (No 1 ) [1999] FCA 1199 ; (1999) 91 FCR 524 (" Consolidated Press (FC) ") and Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd [2001] HCA 32 ; (2001) 207 CLR 235 (" Consolidated Press (HC)") respectively.
That case involved a series of transactions, clearly well-organised and co-ordinated (and in that sense recognisable as a scheme) by which shares in a company with accumulated profits were transferred to other entities in the same group in circumstances which, but for the absence of a tax avoidance purpose, might well have constituted dividend stripping.
Hill J held that, because of the absence of that purpose, the transactions were not a scheme by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping.
However, his Honour held that the transactions fell within subpar (ii) of s 177E(1)(a) because they had substantially the effect of a scheme by way of or in the nature of dividend stripping, notwithstanding that they were not accompanied by a tax avoidance purpose.
In that respect, his Honour's judgment was reversed by the Full Court, and that reversal was upheld by the High Court.
61 In Consolidated Press (FC) , their Honours concluded that case law demonstrated that the term "dividend stripping" was "applicable to a range of transactions provided certain essential characteristics are present" (91 FCR at 560 [132]).
Specifically, their Honours relied upon the judgment of Gibbs J in Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Patcorp Investments Limited (1976) 140 CLR 247 , and upon his Honour's identification of four previous judgments of the High Court in which dividend stripping operations had been involved.
