 
1 Before me is an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from an order of this Court of 19 November 2003.
In support of the application the applicant has filed his own affidavits sworn 3 July 2008 and 2 October 2008, and an affidavit of Dr John N Chalk, psychiatrist, sworn 24 June 2008.
I note that, prior to today's hearing, I informed the parties through the Registrar of the Court that I am personally acquainted with Dr Chalk through friendships of members of our respective families.
I understand however that, notwithstanding this issue, neither party to this application objects to me hearing these proceedings.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 As explained in the decision of Dowsett J of 2 April 2003 ( Robert Joseph Barry Garvey v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2003] FCA 340) events relevant to the decision of his Honour, and the application currently before me, date back to December 1985.
