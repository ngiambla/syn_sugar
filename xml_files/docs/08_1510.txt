In the alternative, the notices seek orders that the applicant provide further particulars of the statement of claim.
It will be convenient to refer to the third ("Chemtura") and fifth ("Chemtura Australia") respondents collectively as "the Chemtura respondents" and the second respondent as "Bayer Australia".
The first, third and fourth respondents will, at various points in these reasons, be identified, collectively, as "the foreign respondents".
2 The proceeding is brought by the applicant as a representative party on behalf of group members who were Australian purchasers of "rubber chemicals" or "rubber products".
It is alleged that they were forced to pay higher prices for these products because of a global cartel arrangement to which the foreign respondents were party together with other manufacturers and suppliers of rubber chemicals.
The cartel arrangement was said to have been entered into in or about July 1995.
3 The grounds relied on by the respondents in support of their strike out applications fall into two broad categories.
