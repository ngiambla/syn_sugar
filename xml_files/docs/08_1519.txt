 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicants are the trustees of the bankrupt estate of Michael Nairn Houston ("the bankrupt").
This is an application under s 134(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("Bankruptcy Act") for a direction as to whether, in realising the interest of the bankrupt in the estate of his late uncle, David Simon Julian De Marnay-Houston ("the deceased") who died leaving a will dated 13 April 1991 ("the will"), the applicants may join the co-beneficiaries under the will in calling upon the executor of the will, Perpetual Trustees Victoria Limited ("Perpetual"), to effect an in specie distribution of the residuary estate of the beneficiaries.
2 The application is supported by an affidavit of Gess Michael Rambaldi sworn on 21 August 2008 and some other affidavits of a formal kind.
The application was served on the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (who did not appear) and the bankrupt.
The bankrupt, although not a party, was represented with leave.
I am indebted to his representative, Mr O'Brien, and to the trustees' counsel, Mr Randall, for their submissions.
