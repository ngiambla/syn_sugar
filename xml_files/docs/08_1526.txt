 
 1 On 29 August 2008 judgment was given in favour of the applicant ( Racing  Wagering Western Australia v Software AG (Australia) Pty Ltd (ACN 090 139 503) [2008] FCA 1332) (the main judgment).
I invited the parties to make additional submissions in relation to costs and whether or not there should be injunctive relief.
The applicant has advised that it does not now press for injunctive relief although that had been part of its original claim.
INDEMNITY COSTS CLAIMED 
 
2 The applicant applies for costs on a party and party basis until 20 April 2007 and thereafter on an indemnity basis.
3 The applicant pursues a costs order on this basis on three grounds.
The first is that an offer of compromise was made on 10 April 2007.
It was clarified on 20 April 2007.
The offer was that the applicant would pay the sum of $300,000 for the future use of the DR Site as defined in the main judgment.
There were additional features of this offer to which I will refer below.
The offer was rejected.
The second ground relied upon is the 'exaggerated nature of the respondent's cross-claim'.
Reliance is placed on [20], [23]-[28], [137]-[148] and [253]-[267] of the main judgment.
Thirdly, the applicant relies upon the non-discovery by the respondent of a critical DAF (as defined in the main judgment).
This document reflected the actual fee which the respondent proposed to seek from the applicant for the DR Site.
It was a sum far less than that pursued in the primary claim at trial.
At trial, no sum at all was awarded to the respondent.
As to the late discovery, see [137]-[138] of the main judgment.
OFFERS 
 
4 In this litigation there were several offers exchanged between the parties.
The chronology of those exchanges is as follows.
The proceedings were initiated on 26 October 2006.
On 12 September 2006, prior to the commencement of the proceedings, the respondent quantified its claim in respect of a DR licence fee (as defined in the main judgment) at a figure of $932,690 plus DR maintenance fees (as defined in the main judgment) of $139,903 per annum exclusive of GST.
5 On 16 October 2006, the respondent offered to discount the claimed DR fee (as defined in the main judgment) by 30% to a figure of $652,883 and to seek DR maintenance fees for three years at $441,044.
It offered to waive any back maintenance DR fees offering, therefore, to accept in total $1,093,927 in relation to the DR Site.
6 On 15 December 2006, the respondent made a further offer to accept $847,417 which it expressed to be a final offer.
It withdrew that offer and reverted to the original claim of $932,609 plus $139,903 per annum as claimed on 12 September 2006.
7 The 10 April 2007 offer in respect of which the applicant's claim is based was set out in a letter of that date to the respondent's solicitors.
