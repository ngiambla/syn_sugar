2 Newcrest moved on the affidavit of Mr Ronald Brown sworn on 17 September 2008.
A further affidavit, sworn on 26 September 2008 by Mr Christopher Goddard, was also relied on.
Apache Northwest Pty Ltd ("Apache") relied on an affidavit of Mr Murray Durham sworn on 26 September 2008 and Santos (BOL) Pty Ltd ("Santos") relied on an affidavit of Mr Andrew Freeman sworn on 26 September 2008.
None of the deponents was required for cross-examination.
3 Before argument concluded the Court was advised that Newcrest had discontinued its application against Santos.
BACKGROUND 
 
4 Newcrest operates the Telfer Gold Mine in the Northwest of Western Australia.
Electrical power for the mine is provided by onsite generators.
These generators are, for economic reasons, fuelled by natural gas.
The gas is supplied pursuant to contractual arrangements between Newcrest and Apache as to 55% and Santos as to 45%.
Under the contract Newcrest is entitled to receive certain agreed quantities of gas.
Apache Energy Ltd ("Apache Energy") was appointed by Apache and Santos as their Sellers' Representative under the contract.
The gas comes from the John Brookes gas field ("the Brookes field") which lies offshore in the Indian Ocean.
The gas is processed on Varanus Island and then piped ashore and on to the mine.
5 On 3 June 2008 a catastrophic explosion occurred on Varanus Island which completely interrupted the supply of gas from the Brookes field and other surrounding fields including the Harriet field.
Repair work commenced quickly and is continuing.
Limited supplies of gas became available in early August but supplies are not expected to return to normal for some time yet.
6 Towards the end of June Apache's American parent company issued a media statement in which it said that it estimated that production to the level of 200 TJ/day would be restored by 15 August increasing to 350 TJ/day by December.
The press release advised:
 "The East Spar J.V.
[processing] facilities are located the greatest distance from the rupture and sustained less damage.
Export pipelines and associated valves, two compressors, instrumentation and control facilities are being repaired to meet the timetable of restoring production by mid-August.
" 
7 In a letter to Newcrest on 30 July 2008 Apache advised that it expected initial production volumes in early August to be of the order of 75-120 TJ/day "increasing to approximately 200 TJ/day by mid-August".
That letter also contained a paragraph which read:
 "Until both the John Brookes and Harriet Fields resume pre-3 June 2008 production volumes we ask that you examine your base gas needs and consider nominating the only minimum volumes of gas that you absolutely require.
Every terajoule of gas that exceeds your base requirements can be used by other customers to meet theirs.
Within the constraints of our obligations under our contracts, our goal during the period of limited production is to deliver enough gas to our customers to fulfil their minimum required volume levels but we will need your cooperation to accomplish this.
..." 
8 There was no evidence as to whether or not the production levels expected by mid-August were or were not achieved.
