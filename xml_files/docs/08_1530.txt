 
1 In an application filed 2 May 2008 the applicant, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, sought declarations, injunctions, pecuniary penalties and other orders pursuant to s 564(1)(b) and s 570 Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) ("the Act "), s 80 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("TPA"), and s 21 Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) against the first respondent in respect of:
 
1.
Conduct by which, as an internet service provider, the first respondent purported to impose fees or charges on customers in respect of complaints made by them to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman in relation to its services.
2.
Its conduct to comply with a direction of the applicant pursuant to s 102 of the Act in relation to that conduct; and
 
3.
Its failure to comply with particular determinations of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman requiring the payment of compensation to complainants by a specified date.
2 The applicant also sought orders against the second respondent, Mr Francis, as ancillary to that conduct.
It is not in dispute that, at all material times, Mr Francis was the sole director and shareholder of the first respondent, and was employed by the first respondent as its Chief Executive Officer.
As a supplier of internet access services, the first respondent was a carriage service provider within the meaning of s 87(1) of the Act , and an eligible carriage service provider within the meaning of s 127 Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 (Cth) ("T(CPSS) Act ").
As a result the first respondent was subject to the TIO Scheme (s 128 T(CPSS) Act ).
It was a condition of the TIO Scheme that customers were not liable to pay any fee or charge (however described) to the provider of a carriage service in respect of a complaint made by a customer to the TIO about the carriage service (s 128(4) T(CPSS) Act ).
The first respondent did not comply with the determination until July 2007, thereby failing to comply with cl 6.1 of the TIO Constitution , s 132 T(CPSS) Act , and a service provider rule within the meaning of s 98 and Sch 2 of the Act .
Accordingly the first respondent acted in contravention of s 101(1) of the Act .
The first respondent did not comply with the determination until July 2007, thereby failing to comply with cl 6.1 of the TIO Constitution , s 132 T(CPSS) Act , and a service provider rule within the meaning of s 98 and Sch 2 of the Act .
Accordingly the first respondent acted in contravention of s 101(1) of the Act .
The respondents did not comply with the direction from 23 July 2007 to 1 January 2008.
4 The applicant claimed that this conduct by the respondents was in contravention of s 101(1) and s 102 (4) of the Act , s 132 T(CPSS) Act , and s 52 TPA, although in resolution of the proceedings the applicant did not press the claim under the TPA.
Section 101(1) is a civil penalty provision (s 101(3) of the Act ).
Proposed Orders 
 
 5 On 12 August 2008 I ordered the parties to attend, participate in, and act reasonably and genuinely in a mediation to be conducted prior to close of business on or before 30 September 2008.
On 30 September 2008 the applicant and the respondents reached agreement as to the terms of resolution of these proceedings to jointly submit to the Court, including proposed orders.
The proposed orders consisted of, in summary:
 
1.
Declarations as to contraventions of s 101(1) of the Act by the first respondent.
2.
Declarations that Mr Francis was knowingly concerned in or party to, and aided, abetted, counselled or procured, the contraventions by the first respondent, being conduct of the kind referred to in s 101(2) of the Act .
3.
Injunctions against the first respondent and Mr Francis pursuant to s 564(1) of the Act .
4.
Payment of pecuniary penalties by the first respondent and Mr Francis pursuant to s 570 of the Act ; and
 
5.
An agreed amount to be paid by the respondents towards the applicant's cost of the proceedings.
6 The orders proposed by the parties are in the following terms:
 Declarations 
 
 1.
A declaration that the first respondent ("WE.net") has contravened section 101(1) of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Telco Act), by offering to members of the public and supplying to customers its internet access services: 
 
 
 
 
 1.1. between approximately 4 January 2005 and 3 January 2006, subject to terms and conditions which included provisions to the following effect:
 1.1.1. that if a customer who had a billing dispute with WE.net in relation to its internet access services did not allow WE.net one calendar month after notification to WE.net by the customer of the dispute, to resolve or process the dispute, before the customer lodged a complaint with any third party, the customer agreed to accept the imposition on the customer by WE.net of an administration fee of $125; and
 1.1.2. that in the event of an unresolved billing dispute, if the customer referred the matter to the TIO before WE.net could resolve the dispute or refer it to mediation, then WE.net could charge to the customer the greater of "$125 or fees as charged by the TIO to WE.net.au", in addition to the administration fee described above;
 1.2. between approximately 4 January 2006 and 14 July 2007, subject to terms and conditions which included provisions to the following effect:
 1.2.1. that if a customer who had a billing dispute with WE.net in relation to its internet access services did not allow WE.net one calendar month after notification to WE.net by the customer of the dispute, to resolve or process the dispute, before the customer lodged a complaint with any third party, the customer agreed to accept the imposition on the customer by WE.net of an administration fee of $160; and
 1.2.2. that in the event of an unresolved billing dispute, if the customer referred the matter to any third party including the TIO, then WE.net could charge the customer "an administration fee of $80/hr (min 2 hours) .. only provided that the dispute is not determined in the customers 100% favour";
 1.3. between approximately 14 July 2007 and 1 January 2008, subject to terms and conditions which included provisions to the effect that, that if a customer who had a billing dispute with WE.net in relation to WE.net's internet access services did not allow WE.net one calendar month after notification to WE.net by the customer of the dispute, to resolve or process the dispute, before the customer lodged a complaint with any third party, the customer agreed that other fees may be charged to the customer by WE.net; 
 
 
 
 
 thereby requiring end-users to pay a fee or charge to WE.net in respect of any complaints made by the end-user to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) about WE.net's internet access service, by which conduct it failed to comply with a service provider rule, being section 128(4A) of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 (the T(CPSS) Act), and thereby failed to comply with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Scheme pursuant to section 132 of the T(CPSS) Act.

 by failing to comply with a determination of the TIO dated 26 November 2006 that WE.net pay, by a specified date, an amount of $34.95 in respect of a complaint lodged with the TIO by a customer of WE.net, Mr Jameson.
5.

6.

An order that, in respect of each instance of contravening conduct pleaded in the Statement of Claim: 
 
 
 
 
 12.1. a single penalty in respect of all contraventions, in the amount of $6,000 be imposed upon the first respondent WE.Net pursuant to section 570 of the Telco Act, such penalty to be paid to the Commonwealth of Australia in accordance with paragraph 12B;

14.
And the Court notes the agreement of the parties that orders 12, 12B, 12C, 13 and 13A will be made by the Court but will not be entered and sealed under Federal Court Rules Order 36 unless there is default on the part of the First or Second Respondents.

 
 Proposed Orders --- the Court's approach 
 
7 The parties concede that it is for the Court to determine whether a pecuniary penalty should be ordered, as well as the quantum of such penalty.
This position is clarified by s 570(1) of the Act which provides:
 (1) If the Federal Court is satisfied that a person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty, in respect of each contravention, as the Court determines to be appropriate.
8 Notwithstanding the discretion vested in the Court by s 570(1) it is also clear that the Court should be aided by any negotiated agreement reached by the parties, and should not depart from an agreed penalty merely because it might have determined another amount to be appropriate, except in a clear case.
This principle was explained by the Full Court in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290, 298, and confirmed by the Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) FCAFC 72.
9 In this case the respondents were not legally represented.
The applicant has however made submissions on penalty and other orders.
The submissions of the applicant in relation to these issues are well-researched and helpful, and I understand from the directions hearing at which the parties last appeared that, while the respondents were not a party to the applicant's submissions, they did not demur from them.
Pecuniary Penalties --- Relevant factors to take into consideration 
 
10 Section 570(2) of the Act provides that, in determining a pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters including:
 (a) the nature and extent of the contravention; and (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and (d) whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct.
( Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1399 ; (2006) 155 FCR 377 , NW Frozen Food [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 254 ; (2005) 215 ALR 281 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd (No 3) [2005] FCA 265 ; (2005) 215 ALR 301.
It is not in dispute that the second respondent, in his role as sole director, shareholder and Chief Executive Officer of the first respondent, was knowingly concerned in or party to the conduct of the first respondent and aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravening conduct of the first respondent.
This conduct of both respondents represented deliberate contravention of the Act over several years.
However I consider that the matter is significant because of the four separate types of conduct pleaded, and that it is appropriate to order relief to ensure that the particular conduct does not recur.
Of more relevance in this context is the fact that the proposed injunctions are framed to apply should the first respondent resume operations as an internet service provider within a two year period.
The applicant accepted in its written submissions that the respondents had limited financial capacity.
In my view:
 
 o it is appropriate that the proposed orders contemplate payment of the proposed amounts (both penalties and costs) by instalments over a defined period;
 
 o while well below the maximum penalty, the penalties are appropriate, and not oppressive, in light of the small business operations of the respondents and the nature of the contraventions;
 
 o in the circumstances of this case the penalties are sufficiently substantial that the respondents would not be inclined to repeat the contraventions.
14 Accordingly I consider that the penalties and other orders jointly proposed by the applicant and the respondents are appropriate and should be made by the Court.
In doing so I note however the agreement of the parties that orders 12, 12B, 12C, 13 and 13A will be made by the Court but will not be entered and sealed under Order 36 Federal Court Rules unless there is default on the part of the First or Second Respondents.
I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.
