 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant, Mr Romanin, by notice of appeal filed on 18 January 2008 seeks to set aside or vary the Commissioner's decision to disallow his objections to notices of assessment for the years ended June 2000 to June 2004.
The appeal is made pursuant to s 14ZZ(a) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).
Mr Romanin seeks orders allowing his appeal against the Commissioner's Notice of Decision on Objection and accordingly seeks orders reducing his taxable income for the years in question.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 On or about 26 May 2005 Mr Romanin lodged tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 claiming, among other things, deductions for the legal expenses relating to claims against Macro Corporation Limited (Macro) and the University Co-operative Bookshop Limited (the Co-op).
3 The Macro claim arose in relation to the cessation of Mr Romanin's employment with the company around 1999.
Mr Romanin entered into a deed of settlement with Macro.
Mr Romanin claimed deductions for the legal expenses incurred and paid in relation to advice obtained in connection with this claim (these expenses are not in issue in the current appeal).
4 In June 1999 Mr Romanin was recruited by Drake Personnel Limited as acting General Manager and Company Secretary for the Co-op.
He was paid $8,000 per week.
This equated to an annual salary of $416,000 plus 9% superannuation.
His appointment as acting General Manager followed the Co-op's suspension of its previous general manager.
Mr Romanin explained that the environment at the Co-op was hostile as there were questions as to whether the predecessor's suspension was valid.
5 In July of that year, Mr Romanin started negotiating a permanent employment contract with the Co-op.
He was offered a position as General Manager and Chief Executive Officer on a permanent fulltime basis, earning a salary of $4,692 per week plus superannuation.
This meant that his salary would be almost halved.
With this in mind, he sought reassurance from the Board of the Co-op that he would not be suspended in the same manner as his predecessor.
He was not willing to accept the position until receipt of confirmation from the Chairman of the Co-op that he would be entitled to 12 months termination notice or payment in lieu if his appointment was terminated.
6 By a letter of 20 August 1999, the Co-op offered Mr Romanin the position as General Manager and Chief Executive Officer on the following terms and conditions:
 
1. a salary of $244,000 per annum;
 
2.
9% superannuation;
 
3. payment of Director and Officers indemnity insurance;
 
4. payment of reasonable mobile phone costs;
 
5. performance based bonus to be agreed and assessed annually;
 
6. separation/termination provisions and payments to be agreed; and
 
7. key performance indicators to be agreed.
7 After discussing the offer by telephone with the Chairman, while Mr Romanin was in Singapore, Mr Romanin made it clear to the Chairman that he would only accept the position if he was guaranteed a 12 month termination notice period or payment in lieu.
He was informed by the Chairman that he would be entitled to a termination notice period of 12 months plus one month for each year of service that had been completed, or alternatively payment in lieu.
On this basis, Mr Romanin accepted the Co-op's offer.
8 He commenced employment with the Co-op and was paid in accordance with the provisions of the new contract but at the time of commencing he had not signed a written contract nor was one provided to him.
9 On 15 September 1999 he received a draft service agreement from the Co-op which provided for only a six month termination notice period and a probationary period.
He complained that the draft service agreement was inconsistent with the terms and conditions of his employment contract that had been agreed with the Chairman.
The Co-op denied the employment contract existed or that it had ever agreed to such terms and conditions.
10 In October 1999, the Co-op suddenly terminated Mr Romanin's employment and gave him seven days notice.
The Co-op denies that the employment contract ever existed and denied that Mr Romanin was entitled to a 12 month termination notice period or payment in lieu.
11 Mr Romanin was forced to find alternative employment.
He was unemployed for some time but commenced various consultancies and employment with other entities and earned $144,983.51 in the 12 month period following termination of his employment.
LEGAL ADVICE 
 
12 In early 2000, Mr Romanin consulted a barrister to provide his opinion as to whether the employment contract existed and whether he was entitled to enforce the terms of the employment contract.
He was advised that the employment contract did exist, that it was enforceable and that Mr Romanin was entitled to a 12 month termination notice period or payment in lieu.
Counsel also advised Mr Romanin that if he were to commence legal proceedings against the Co-op, the claim would be for an order that the employment contract existed and a contractual payment under the employment contract.
PROCEEDINGS IN THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COMMISSION 
 
13 On the basis of the advice received, Mr Romanin instructed solicitors from late 2000 to commence proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales (the Commission).
A conflict of interest arose which meant that the original solicitors withdrew and he appointed another firm of solicitors.
That firm filed an amended summons for relief at the Commission and represented Mr Romanin together with counsel in the course of the proceedings.
The proceedings were quite extensive and took place over five days.
14 Ultimately in November 2003, the Commission upheld Mr Romanin's claims.
The Commission held that the employment contract and its terms and conditions existed and that Mr Romanin was entitled to the 12 months termination notice period or payment in lieu thereof.
The Co-op was required to recognise the employment contract and pay him the total value of the employment package for the period of 12 months less any salary and other earnings that Mr Romanin had earned in alternative employment during the 12 months following the termination of his employment.
15 The Commission ordered the Co-op to pay to Mr Romanin the sum of $202,829.90.
