 
1 Mr Miron Masliczek joined the Australian Army as a National Serviceman in 1966.
He served for two years.
For part of this time he was on active service in South Vietnam.
In later years he suffered a number of medical conditions which were caused by his war service.
He was paid a disability pension by reason of these conditions.
2 In 2005 he applied for a further pension entitlement because of, among other conditions, post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"), osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand and hearing problems in the right ear.
He attributed these conditions to his service in South Vietnam.
His application insofar as it was based on these conditions was rejected by the Repatriation Commission ("the Commission") and his appeal to the Veterans' Review Board ("the VRB") from the Commission's decision failed.
He appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal").
The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the VRB.
Mr Masliczek now purports to appeal to this Court.
