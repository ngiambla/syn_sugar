 Background 
 
1 The Superannuation Act 1922 (Cth) as relevantly amended ('the 1922 Act') drew a distinction between 'The Fund' and 'The New Superannuation Fund'.
2 By s 4 of the 1922 Act ' The Fund ' was defined to mean 'the Superannuation Fund established under this Act' and ' The New Superannuation Fund ' was defined to mean the superannuation fund established by the Superannuation Act 1976 (Cth) ('the 1976 Act').
3 The 'New Superannuation Fund', established by s 40 of the 1976 Act, was the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund No.
2
 
4 By s 4 of the Superannuation Act 1990 (Cth) ('the 1990 Act') the Minister administering the 1990 Act, then the Minister for Finance, was required by deed to establish an occupational superannuation scheme, to be known as the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, for the benefit of persons employed by the Commonwealth and others and to establish and vest in the PSS Board, established by s 20 of the 1990 Act, a fund for the purposes of the scheme so established.
The fund so established and vested in the PSS Board became known as the PSS Fund .
5 As from 1 July 2006 the board ceased to be the PSS Board and became Australian Reward Investment Alliance, the applicant in these proceedings (see s 3 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Act 200 6 (Cth) and clause 47 of Schedule 1 thereto), also referred to as the 'Board'.
6 By s 21 of the 1990 Act, Australia Reward Investment Alliance was constituted as a body corporate with perpetual succession which could sue and be sued in its corporate name and, by s 23 it was to consist of:
(a) a Chairperson; and
(b) 6 other trustees;
 
appointed on a part-time basis.
7 Section 3 of the 1990 Act defined ' trustee ' to mean 'a person who holds office as a trustee of the Board (i.e.
Australian Reward Investment Alliance), and includes the Chairperson.
8 By a Deed made 21 June 1990 by the Minister for Finance in the name of the Commonwealth of Australia (the 'Trust Deed'), the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme was established as an occupational superannuation scheme to come into force on 1 July 1990 and to be administered by the PSS Board, later Australian Reward Investment Alliance.
9 The functions and powers of the Board in relation to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the PSS Fund were, by virtue of s 22 of the 1990 Act, as set out in the Trust Deed.
The Board was also responsible under s 22 for the general administration of the 1990 Act.
10 Clause 3 of the Trust Deed recorded the 'Functions and Powers of the Board' which included:
 
 
 '3.1 The functions of the Board in relation to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the PSS Fund are to administer the scheme and to manage and invest the PSS Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Act and this Deed including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing the following functions: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) to pay benefits to or in respect of members, preserved benefit members and associates, and to make payments to and receive payments from the Commonwealth as provided for in the Act; 
 
 (b) to provide information about benefits or potential benefits, and available options to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) members; (ii) preserved benefit members; (iii) associates; and (iv) potential members; 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.3 Notwithstanding anything contained in the Deed, the Board shall, in exercising its PSS functions [those set out in subclause 3.1] and PSS powers [those set out in subclause 3.2] : 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) act honestly in all matters concerning the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the PSS Fund; 
 
 (b) exercise, in relation to all matters affecting the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the PSS Fund, the same degree of care, skill and diligence as an ordinary prudent person would exercise in dealing with property of another for whom the person felt morally bound to provide; 
 
 (c) ensure that the Board's duties and powers are performed and exercised in the best interests of members, preserved benefit members and associates; 
 
 (d) keep the money and other assets of the PSS Fund separate from any money and assets, respectively: 
 
 
 
(i) that are held by the Board personally or members of the Board personally; or (ii) that are money or assets, as the case may be, of a standard employer-sponsor, or an associate of a standard employer-sponsor, as defined in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 , of the PSS Fund.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) not enter into any contract, or do anything else, that would prevent the Board from, or hinder the Board in, properly performing or exercising the Board's functions and powers; 
 
 (f) formulate and give effect to an investment strategy that has regard to the whole of the circumstances of the PSS Fund including, but not limited to, the following: 
 
 
 
(i) the risk involved in making, holding and realising, and the likely return from, the PSS Fund's investments having regard to its objectives and its expected cash flow requirements; (ii) the composition of the PSS Fund's investments as a whole including the extent to which the investments are diverse or involve the PSS Fund in being exposed to risks from inadequate diversification; (iii) the liquidity of the PSS Fund's investments having regard to its expected cash flow requirements; (iv) the ability of the PSS Fund to discharge its existing and prospective liabilities; 
 
 
 (g) if there are any reserves of the PSS Fund --- formulate and to (sic) give effect to a strategy for their prudential management, consistent with the PSS Fund's investment strategy and its capacity to discharge its liabilities (whether actual or contingent) as and when they fall due; 
 
 (h) allow a member or a person who has a preserved benefit access to any information or any documents prescribed in Regulations under the Corporations Act 2001 .

 
 
 
 
 
 3.4 The Board must cause proper records to be kept in respect of: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) contributions paid into the PSS Fund; and 
 
 (b) benefits paid under the Act and this Deed (whether out of the PSS Fund or out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund); and 
 
 (c) amounts that, under the Act and this Deed, are: 
 
 
 
(i) paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund into the PSS Fund; or (ii) out of the PSS Fund into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
' 

 
11 Under s 29 of the 1990 Act the Commissioner for Superannuation under Part II of the 1976 Act was responsible for the provision of administrative services to the Board in the performance of its functions in relation to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.
My understanding is that the Commissioner for Superannuation is also the Chief Executive Officer of 'ComSuper' to which reference is made hereafter.
12 By s 25 of the 1990 Act provision was made for the Trustee Act 1925 (ACT) to apply to and in relation to the trustees acting in the performance of their functions, or the exercise of their powers, under the Trust Deed, except in so far as it was inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth.
13 It may be observed that whilst the Chairperson and holders of office as 'other trustees' of the Board were trustees within the meaning of the 1990 Act, the Board was not itself a trustee to whom the Trustee Act 1925 (ACT) applied.
This was so notwithstanding the obligations imposed upon the Board by clause 9.1 of the Trust Deed which provided as follows:
 
 
 '9.1 All contributions and other moneys paid to the Board, or as directed by the Board, shall be held in trust by the Board in the PSS Fund.
...' 
 


 
14 By s 28A of the 1990 Act the Board was empowered to delegate all or any of its powers under the 1990 Act or the regulations to, inter alia, a trustee within the meaning of the Act, the Commissioner for Superannuation or a member of the staff assisting the Commissioner for Superannuation in the performance of his or her functions under the Act.
15 By clause 12 of the Trust Deed the Board was empowered to delegate all or any of its powers under the Deed other than its power to reconsider its own decisions or decisions made by its delegates to, inter alia, a member of the Board (i.e.
one of the trustees), the Commissioner for Superannuation or a member of the staff assisting the Commissioner for Superannuation in the performance of his or her functions.
16 The Trust Deed made provision for the Board's decision-making process.
Under the heading ' Meetings of the Board of Trustees ' clause 8 of the Trust Deed provided as follows:
 
 
 '8.1 The Board shall hold such meetings as are necessary for the conduct of its affairs.

 
 8.2 The Chairperson may at any time convene a meeting of the Board and shall, when so requested in writing by another Trustee, convene a meeting of the Board within 30 days of receiving such notice.

 
 8.3 The Chairperson shall preside at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairperson is present.
If the Chairperson is not going to be present at a meeting of the Board, the Chairperson may nominate one of the Trustees to be Chairperson for the meeting.
In the absence of such nomination, the Trustees shall elect one of the Trustees present at the meeting as a Chairperson for the meeting.

 
 8.4 At a meeting of the Board 4 Trustees, or acting Trustees, shall constitute a quorum and all decisions of the Board must be affirmed by at least 4 votes of the Trustees, or acting Trustees, present in person and voting.

 
 8.5 The Board shall keep accurate records of all meetings held by the Board.
' 
 


 
17 Section 6 of the 1990 Act made provision for membership of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.
Under s 6(1) of the 1990 Act persons employed in a permanent capacity by the Commonwealth or by an approved authority were constituted as members of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme subject to certain exceptions.
18 The second respondent in these proceedings had been a member of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme constituted by the 1976 Act, but on 4 April 1991 she transferred from that scheme to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme constituted by the 1990 Act.
She became a member of the PSS Defined Benefits Plan as opposed to a member of the PSS Accumulation Plan.
19 It was common ground that the second respondent was at all material times a 'regular member' of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.
20 Where benefits became payable under the Rules for the administration of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme as set out in the Schedule to the Trust Deed, s 16 of the 1990 Act made provision for the Board to make payments to the Commonwealth out of the PSS fund and for the Commonwealth to pay the relevant benefits under the Rules.
Termination of employment on the ground of inability to perform duties because of physical or mental incapacity 
 
21 Under s 29 of the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth) ('the Public Service Act ') the employment of an Australian Public Service employee could be terminated by notice in writing in certain circumstances.
For an employee in the circumstances of the second respondent the only grounds for termination were as specified in s 29(3) of the Public Service Act which provided as follows:
 
 
 '29(3) For an ongoing APS employee, the following are the only grounds for termination: 
 
 (a) the employee is excess to the requirements of the Agency; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the employee lacks, or has lost, an essential qualification for performing his or her duties; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) non performance, or unsatisfactory performance, of duties; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) inability to perform duties because of physical or mental incapacity; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) failure to satisfactorily complete an entry level training course; 
 
 (f) failure to meet a condition imposed under subsection 22(6); 
 
 (g) breach of the Code of Conduct; 
 
 (h) any other ground prescribed by the regulations..' 
 


 
22 The power of termination of the employment of an Australian Public Service employee under s 29(3)(d) of the Public Service Act was itself qualified by s 13(1) of the 1990 Act which provided as follows:
 
 
 '13(1) In spite of anything contained in any Act, award, determination or contract of employment, a member who is under the age of 60 is not capable of being retired from the employment or office by virtue of which he or she is a member on the ground that, because of any mental or physical condition, the member is unable to perform his or her duties, unless the Board has certified in writing that, if the member is so retired, the member will be entitled to receive invalidity benefits under the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.

 
 (1A) The Board may only give a certificate in respect of a member under subsection (1) if the Board has approved the invalidity retirement of the member under the Rules.

 
 (2) In subsection (1), a reference to a member being retired from employment or office includes a reference to the services of the member being otherwise terminated.
' 
 


 
23 By a notice in writing dated 1 December 2005 the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission terminated the second respondent's employment in accordance with s 29 of the Public Service Act .
The notice was expressed as a ' NOTICE OF RETIREMENT --- INVALIDITY ' and provided as follows:
 'I, Alastair Milroy, currently occupying the role of Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission, using my powers and functions under Section 29 of the Public Service Act 1999 : 
 
 1. being satisfied that you are within the meaning of subsection 3(d) of the Public Service Act 1999 , inability (sic) to perform duties because of physical or mental incapacity; and 
 
 2. having received an Invalidity Retirement Certificate from the PSS Board Delegate; 
 
 GIVE NOTICE TO YOU, Anne Maree Matthews, Executive Level 1, that you are to be retired from the Australian Public Service.
DATE OF EFFECT This retirement will take effect at the expiration of 7 December 2005.
' 

 
24 Upon the notice in writing, terminating the second respondent's employment, taking effect at the end of the day on 7 December 2005, the second respondent ceased to be a member of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.
25 Prior to the notice in writing being given, the Board had certified in writing that, if the second respondent was 'retired'/terminated on the ground that, because of her mental or physical condition, she was unable to perform her duties, she would be entitled to receive invalidity benefits under the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.
26 The termination of the second respondent's employment constituted an 'invalidity retirement' within the meaning of the Defined Benefits Plan section of the Rules.
However, by an express exclusion, her 'invalidity retirement' did not fall within the definition of 'involuntary retirement' in the Rules (see clause B1.2.1).
The second respondent's complaint 
 
27 On 20 December 2005 the second respondent proceeded to complete a Registration of Complaint form which she forwarded to the first respondent, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal ('the Tribunal') and copied to the Board.
The matter about which the second respondent complained was identified as 'Disability Benefit' and 'Payment Calculation'.
The Amount of the benefit/Amount in dispute was recorded as being $4,000 - $10,000 per annum.
In particular, the second respondent was not satisfied with the assessment of her final average salary.
28 When asked to state why the second respondent believed that her 'Fund's decision is unfair or unreasonable' she stated:
 'I believe that the PSS is both unfair  unreasonable in the method they use for assessment of final average salary in Invalidity cases.
In Retrenchment cases the PSS use a "weighted" method to calculate final monies.
My Invalidity was unexpected so the Retrenchment method should apply to my case' 

 
29 The second respondent identified her loss as follows:
 'My loss is financial.
My pension is $10,000 per annum less than I would have received at age 60  $4,000 pa less than if my exit salary had been allowed in the calculation of my FAS [which I would understand to be a reference to her final average salary].
' 

 
30 The resolution which the second respondent sought was:
 'That the PSS use the weighted "Retrenchment" method to calculate my Invalidity benefit.
Alternatively my exit salary of $87,305 be used to calculate my final benefit.
' 
31 In relation to 'other relevant comments' the second respondent added:
 'My FAS at 7-12-2005 is $77,195.
On 21-3-2006 my FAS would have been $84,371.
At Age 60 FAS would be $94,477 (Annual salary increases  not promotion which was very likely).
I have a shortened life expectancy due to my health problems.
' 

 
32 When the second respondent forwarded her 'Registration of Complaint Form' to the Tribunal, she did so under cover of a letter dated 20 December 2005 in which she said:
 'I have attached my "Registration of Complaint Form" setting out my complaint about a decision, by the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), regarding the calculation of my invalidity retirement benefit (specifically my Final average Salary --- FAS), which I believe is both unfair and unreasonable.
...
Copies of my emails to and from PSS, setting out my complaint (about the method of calculating my final average salary), are attached ... ...
I was retired from the Commonwealth Public Service on invalidity grounds on 7 December 2005.
My health problems, unplanned and not really expected at age 55/56, came as quite a shock to me.
... My pre-assessment payments (50% of my salary) ceased on 7 December 2005, and so I had no option other than choose this date as my retirement date.
Otherwise I would have had no income.
...' 

 
In her letter to the Tribunal of 3 February 2006, referred to below, the second respondent repeated the last two sentences quoted above.
33 It seems to me that the concept of a Commonwealth public servant choosing her own 'retirement date', where her employment is terminated by a notice in writing given by the relevant Agency Head under s 29 of the Public Service Act , is misconceived.
34 The Board certainly has no part to play in determining when the employment of an Australian Public Service employee is to be terminated on the ground that the employee is unable to perform her duties because of physical or mental incapacity.
True it is that s 13(1) of the 1990 Act places a restraint upon the giving of a termination notice under s 29(3)(d) of the Public Service Act where the relevant employee is under the age of 60, as the second respondent was in December 2005, and the Board has not certified in writing that if the employee is terminated on the ground that because of a mental or physical condition she is unable to perform her duties, she would be entitled to receive invalidity benefits under the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme.
In the second respondent's case, a certificate was relevantly provided on 11 November 2005, whereupon it became a matter for her Agency Head to decide when, if at all, a notice of termination should be given to her.
35 As it transpires, on 23 November 2005 the Australian Crime Commission wrote a letter to the second respondent under the heading ' Pre-assessment Payments and Invalidity Retirement '.
Relevantly, the letter provided:
 'Pre-assessment Payments As you are aware, Comsuper have approved payment of pre-assessment payments for yourself.
The date of effect of the pre-assessment payments is 14 April 2004 and payments commence at the expiration of all paid sick leave.
... As you are aware, you utilised annual leave and long service leave at the expiration of your paid sick leave (from 23 September 2004) ... ... Invalidity Retirement Comsuper has also approved invalidity retirement for yourself.
The date of effect of your retirement is determined between the ACC and yourself.
Comsuper have advised that your pre-assessment payments must cease effective close of business 7 December 2005 or on the retirement date, whichever is earlier, therefore I would recommend a retirement date for yourself of 7 December 2005.
' 
36 Division 10 of the Rules as set out in the Schedule to the Trust Deed dealt with 'Pre-Assessment Payments'.
Relevantly, Rule B10.10 provided as follows:
 
 
 
 'B10.10.1 The Board may pay pre-assessment payments to a member who has been off work for a continuous period of 28 days or more because of a serious medical condition, unless ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 B10.10.2 Before deciding whether to pay pre-assessment payments to a member the Board must obtain a report from: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a Commonwealth Medical Officer; or 
 
 (b) an approved medical practitioner ; 
 
 
 
 
 whether there is a likelihood the member will be totally and permanently incapacitated because of the condition causing ... her absence from work.

 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 B10.10.4 The Board must pay pre-assessment payments to a member if, after considering the report obtained under Rule B10.10.2, it is satisfied there is a real likelihood the member will be totally and permanently incapacitated .

 ... 
 
 B10.10.6 Pre-assessment payments are not payable during the first six months of the member being off work while the member is in receipt of sick leave full pay or sick leave half pay.

 ...' 
 
 


 
37 Whilst the Australian Crime Commission's letter of 23 November 2005 suggested that the date of effect of the second respondent's retirement was to be determined between the Australian Crime Commission and the second respondent, it seems to me that the second respondent was in error in thinking that she could choose the date upon which her employment was to be terminated.
In any event, it is clear that insofar as she was able to influence the selection of the date upon which the Australian Crime Commission's notice of termination of her employment would take effect, she was content to accept the end of the day on 7 December 2005 as her date of termination/retirement.
As she said in her letter of 20 December 2005 if she had not chosen 7 December 2005 as her 'retirement date' she would have been left in a position where she 'had no income'.
38 As it transpires, the second respondent's complaint was premature, as s 19(1) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth) ('the SRC Act') had not been satisfied.
Section 19(1) relevantly provided:
 
 
 '19(1) The Tribunal cannot deal with a complaint under section 14 ... unless the complainant satisfies the Tribunal that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a complaint about the same subject matter was previously made to an appropriate person under arrangements for dealing with such complaints made under section 101 of the Supervision Act (a reference to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth)); and 
 
 (b) the complaint so made was not settled to the satisfaction of the complainant within 90 days or such longer period as the Tribunal allows.
' 
 
 


 
39 On 4 January 2006 the second respondent sent an email to 'complaints@pss.gov.au' which included:
 'I attach a copy of a letter from the SCT [presumably a reference to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal] which was sent to you on 23 December 2005 together with a copy of my letter of complaint to the SCT.
The SCT will not deal with my complaint until the Trustee of the PSS has formerly (sic) responded to me.
If I am not satisfied with a response from the PSS, I have to lodge a new complaint with the SCT.
Please note that I am asking for my current salary of $87,405 to count as my FAS (not just form part of it) or that the weighting system used for Retrenchments is applied to my case.
...' 

 
40 The second respondent sent a follow up email on 30 January 2006.
Thereafter she received two emails in reply from a Complaints Officer within ComSuper, both of which were sent on 1 February 2006.
The response to the second respondent's email of 4 January 2006 was as follows:
 'I refer to your email of 4 January 2006, which was accepted as a complaint from that date regarding the Final Average Salary (FAS) used to calculate your Public Sector Superannuation (PSS) scheme invalidity benefit.
The method used to determine the FAS for PSS invalidity benefits is specified in the PSS Rules and is the average salary for superannuation purposes on the 3 birthdays prior to the date of invalidity retirement.
In your particular case your PSS invalidity benefit has been calculated based on a FAS of $77,195 which is your average salary for superannuation purposes on your 3 birthdays prior to your invalidity retirement on 7 December 2005.
In your email you have asked that your salary as at the date of your invalidity retirement be taken into account when calculating your FAS, as is the case for PSS retrenchment benefit calculations.
The PSS Rules are quite specific in relation to FAS calculations and do not include any discretion that would allow us to include your salary at retirement of $87,305 in your FAS calculation.
The issue of whether PSS invalidity FAS calculations should allow for the inclusion of salaries as at the date of invalidity retirement is, therefore, a policy matter and any further enquiries in this regard should be directed to the Minister for Finance and Administration who is responsible for PSS policy matters.
The fact that we have not provided a formal response to your earlier email is regretted and please accept my apologies in this regard.
It was, however, our understanding from earlier telephone conversations with yourself and your husband that you were aware of the fact that any further queries regarding this matter needed to be directed to the Minister and, as a result, a formal response to you was not required.
' 

 
41 By her letter dated 3 February 2006 the second respondent repeated her complaint to the Tribunal.
42 In s 3(2) of the SRC Act ' complaint ' was defined to mean, relevantly, 'a complaint that has been made under section 14'.
43 Section 14 of the SRC Act relevantly provided:
 
 
 '14(1) This section applies if the trustee of a fund has made a decision ... in relation to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a particular member or a particular former member of a regulated superannuation fund; 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) ... a person may make a complaint ... to the Tribunal, that the decision is or was unfair or unreasonable.

 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (7) a complaint under subsection (2) is to be made by sending or delivering a written complaint to the office of the Tribunal.
' 
 
 

44 In respect of any complaint so made and which has not been settled to the satisfaction of the complainant in accordance with s 19(1) of the SRC Act, the powers of the Tribunal are to be found in s 37 of the SRC Act, which relevantly provided:
 
 
 '37(1) For the purpose of reviewing a decision of the trustee of a fund that is the subject of a complaint under s 14: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Tribunal has all the powers, obligations and discretions that are conferred on the trustee; and 
 
 (b) subject to subsection (6), must make a determination in accordance with subsection (3) 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (3) On reviewing the decision of a trustee ... that is the subject of, or relevant to, a complaint under section 14, the Tribunal must make a determination in writing: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) affirming the decision; or 
 
 (b) remitting the matter to which the decision relates to the trustee ... for reconsideration in accordance with the directions of the Tribunal; or 
 
 (c) varying the decision; or 
 
 (d) setting aside the decision and substituting a decision for the decision so set aside.

 
 
 
 
 
 (4) The Tribunal may only exercise its determination-making power under subsection (3) for the purpose of placing the complainant as nearly as practicable in such a position that the unfairness, unreasonableness, or both, that the Tribunal has determined to exist in relation to the trustee's decision that is the subject of the complaint no longer exists.

 
 (5) The Tribunal must not do anything under subsection (3) that would be contrary to law, to the governing rules of the fund concerned and ... 
 
 (6) The Tribunal must affirm a decision referred to under subsection (3) if it is satisfied that the decision, in its operation in relation to 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the complainant; ... 
 .... 
 
 was fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
' 
 
 
 

45 It is appropriate to note the extended definition of 'decision' made by a trustee for the purposes of the SRC Act.
Section 4 provided:
 '4.
For the purposes of this Act a trustee ... makes a decision if: 
 
 
 (a) the trustee ... or person acting for the trustee ... makes, or fails to make a decision; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the trustee ... or a person acting for the trustee ... engages in any conduct, or fails to engage in any conduct, in relation to making a decision.
' 
 
 
 

46 Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1997 (Cth) make provision for persons, who are aggrieved by decisions, by conduct engaged in for the purpose of making decisions or by the failure to make decisions, to apply for orders of review in respect thereof.
In that context, Mason CJ, with whose reasons Brennan and Deane JJ relevantly agreed, said in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 341-342:
 'The distinction between reviewable decisions and conduct engaged for the purpose of making such a decision is somewhat elusive.
However, once it is accepted that "decision" connotes a determination for which provision is made by or under a statute, one that generally is substantive, final and operative, the place of "conduct" in the statutory scheme of things becomes reasonably clear.
... ....
There is a clear distinction between a "decision" and "conduct" engaged in for the purpose of making a decision.
A challenge to conduct is an attack upon the proceedings engaged in before the making of the decision.
It is not a challenge to decisions made as part of the decision-making process except in the sense that if the decisions are procedural in character they will precede the conduct which is under challenge.
In relation to conduct, the complaint is that the process of decision-making was flawed; in relation to a decision, the complaint is that the actual decision was erroneous.
To give an example, the continuation of proceedings in such a way as to involve a denial of natural justice would amount to "conduct".
That is not to deny that the final determination of the proceedings would constitute a decision reviewable for denial of natural justice.
' 
47 In relation to the exercise by the Tribunal of its powers, s 36 of the SRC Act provided:
 '36.
The Tribunal, in reviewing a decision or conduct: 
 
 
 (a) is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) is to act as speedily as proper consideration of the review allows, having regard to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) the objectives laid down by section 11 [providing mechanisms for the conciliation of complaints; and if a complaint cannot be resolved by conciliation --- the review of the decision or conduct to which the complaint relates; that are fair, economical, informal and quick]; and 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii) if the complaint relates to a fund --- the interests of all the members of the fund; and 
 
 
 
 (c) may inform itself of any matter relevant to the review in any way it thinks appropriate.
' 
 
 


 
48 In considering the scope of a review by the Tribunal under ss 36-37 of the SRC Act Allsop J, as his Honour then was, said in Retail Employees Superannuation Pty Limited v Crocker [2001] FCA 1330 ; (2001) 48 ATR 359 ('Crocker') at [132]:
 '132 ... if the matters thrown up by events and circumstances, including correspondence from the member, do not properly raise anything beyond what was in fact decided by the Trustee, it is not appropriate for the tribunal, with a matter before it received by way of s 14 and under Pt 4 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth), to take the opportunity to deal with other aspects of the relationship between the member and the Trustee foreign to the decision for review: see Hay v Briffa.

The last mentioned case was reported as Briffa v Hay (1997) 75 FCR 428.
49 Rule B.3.5.1 of the Rules provided for the calculation of average salary of a regular member as follows:
 
 
 
 'B3.5.1 The average salary on any day of a regular member is calculated by the following formula: 
 
 
 
 average salary = X + B1 + B2 + B3 + E n 
 
 
 where the factors are defined in the following Table Average Salary Factors according to the mode of cessation of membership: 
 ...' 
 
 


 
50 The 'Average Salary Factors' were then set out in a table which dealt with 'Cessation otherwise than on involuntary retirement ' and 'Cessation on involuntary retirement '.
51 It is common ground that the second respondent's invalidity retirement/termination required an application of the Average Salary Factors as set out in the column headed 'Cessation otherwise than on involuntary retirement '.
52 Given the period of her membership, the calculation of 'average salary' for the second respondent required her salary as at the date of her 56 th birthday, her salary as at the date of her 55 th birthday and her salary as at the date of her 54 th birthday to be added together and divided by 3.
As at 7 December 2005, the second respondent was already 56 years of age.
53 Under clause B1.2.1 of the Rules ' final average salary ' was defined to mean 'the average salary applicable to a member on ... her last day of membership [i.e.
the date on which she ceased to be a member]'.
54 Despite the formula for the calculation of 'average salary' in Rule B3.5.1, Rule B3.5.3 provided as follows:
 
 
 
 'B3.5.3 The Board may use an alternate average salary in circumstances where it considers that the average salary calculated in Rule B3.5.1 is not in accordance with the spirit of the Rules and would lead to inequitable treatment between members.
' 
 
 


 
55 Notwithstanding the terms of the second respondent's email of 4 January 2006 and ComSuper's reply to it of 30 January 2006 it appears that by a letter dated 5 September 2006 the second respondent requested a further review of the average salary used in the calculation of her invalidity benefit.
On 24 October 2006 the Board's Chief Business Operations Officer, who was the Delegate responsible for decisions under Rule B3.5.3, appears to have accepted a recommendation of ComSuper that the Board not exercise its power under Rule B3.5.3.
The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal's consideration of the complaint 
 
56 The first respondent, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal constituted by Noel Davis, Presiding Member and Jeff Humphreys, Member proceeded to conduct a review of the second respondent's complaint on the papers.
A review meeting was held on 24 April 2007 and a further review meeting on 20 September 2007, but nothing relevantly occurred at those meetings.
57 In its 'Review Determination and Reasons' dated 21 November 2007, the ' DECISION UNDER REVIEW ' was identified by the Tribunal as follows:
 'DECISION UNDER REVIEW 
 
 2.
On 14 December 2005 the Trustee advised the Complainant of her Invalidity Benefit.

 
 3.
The Complainant objected to the amount of the invalidity benefit calculated by the Trustee and to the lack of advice regarding her options.

 
 4.
On 1 February 2006, the Trustee, having considered the Complainant's complaint, affirmed its original decision.
' 
 


 
58 It is important to note that the definition of 'trustee' in the SRC Act is different from that contained in the 1990 Act.
In s 3(2) of the SRC Act the following definition appears:
 '3(2) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 
 ... 
 trustee, in relation to a complaint, means, the trustee of the fund to which the complaint relates' 
 
 

In relation to the PSS Fund, the Board was plainly the trustee for the purposes of the SRC Act.
59 In the Tribunal's Review Determination and Reasons, the second respondent's complaint, which had been the subject of the Decision under Review, was recorded as follows:
 'COMPLAINT 
 
 11.
On 20 December 2005 and 3 February 2006, the Complainant lodged a complaint with the Tribunal that the amount of her invalidity pension benefit paid to her from the Fund was unfair and unreasonable.
