 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 NTD8 is an Aboriginal community controlled health organisation providing health services to the residents of Aboriginal communities, outstations and pastoral properties in the Katherine region of the Northern Territory.
It has been given the pseudonym 'NTD8' to protect the privacy of those of its patients who may be affected by these proceedings.
2 In May 2008, the Australian Crime Commission ('ACC') served an amended notice on NTD8 under s 29(1) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) ('the ACC Act') requiring it to produce certain medical records and others documents held by it.
In summary, the medical records related to the presentations by patients of NTD8 at clinics conducted by it, for treatment that may have been associated with family and domestic violence and/or other forms of assault including sexual assault.
The ACC said that it required the medical records as a part of its Special Intelligence Operation into Indigenous violence or child abuse in the Northern Territory.
3 NTD8 had already commenced these proceedings to challenge the original notice which had been served by the ACC about a month earlier.
When the amended notice was served, it amended its application in these proceedings to challenge that amended notice.
The crux of NTD8's challenge to the amended notice is that Mr Anderson, the ACC Examiner who issued the amended notice, was required to take into account, as a primary consideration, the best interests of the children concerned, and he had failed to do so.
4 Before turning to consider those issues, it is necessary to briefly set out some of the factual background to these proceedings and to set out some of the relevant provisions of the ACC Act.
In doing so, I will necessarily duplicate some of the material I set out in my earlier decision on the application by NTD8 that I should disqualify myself for apprehended bias (see [2008] FCA 984).
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
5 In June 2007, following the publication of the 'Little Children are Sacred' Report which was commissioned by the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government decided to establish the Northern Territory Emergency Response, more commonly known as the Northern Territory Intervention, to deal with the incidence of child abuse and domestic violence in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.
6 As a part of the Northern Territory Intervention, a package of four pieces of legislation was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament.
It included the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory Emergency Response and Other Measures) Act 2007 ('the FACSIA Act') and the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007, both of which made a number of amendments to the ACC Act.
In general terms those amendments extended the ambit of the ACC's functions to include intelligence operations in relation to Indigenous violence or child abuse.
I have set out a summary of those amendments in the Relevant Legislative Provisions section below.
7 In pursuit of its extended functions, on 5 February 2008, the Board of the ACC issued a Determination entitled the Special Intelligence Operation Authorisation and Determination (Indigenous Violence or Child Abuse) 2008 ('the Special Intelligence Operation').
The purpose of the Special Intelligence Operation included the collection and analysis of criminal information and intelligence relating to federally relevant criminal activities in relation to Indigenous violence or child abuse or other federally relevant criminal activity.
Its objectives included:
 (a) Identifying offenders involved in Indigenous violence and child abuse; (b) Supporting investigations by partner agencies into violence or child abuse in Indigenous communities by utilising ACC coercive powers where appropriate; 
 
 
 
(c) Enhancing the understanding of the nature and extent of violence or child abuse in Indigenous communities; (d) Providing intelligence based advice to the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory organisations on violence or child abuse in remote and urban Indigenous communities, including organised crime involvement in substance abuse, alcohol and pornography; and 
 
 
 
(e) Facilitating intelligence collection and sharing.
" 
8 Mr Jeffrey Phillip Anderson is an Examiner appointed under s 46B(1) of the ACC Act.
On 10 April 2008, in his role as an ACC Examiner and as a part of the Special Intelligence Operation, he issued the original notice to NTD8 under s 29(1) of the ACC Act.
9 In response, on the morning of 7 May 2008, NTD 8 issued these proceedings under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) seeking to challenge Mr Anderson's decision to the issue of that original notice.
10 In the period immediately following 7 May 2008, NTD 8 filed and served affidavits by Dr Andrew Bell sworn 9, 18 and 20 May 2008 and by Registered Nurse Rebecca Gooley sworn 9 May 2008, which set out their concerns if NTD8 were to comply with the original notice.
In Nurse Gooley's affidavit she deposed to the results of her searches of NTD8's computer system which she had undertaken in response to the original notice.
She set those out at paragraphs 7 to 8 of her affidavit, as follows:
 "In relation to the information sought about injuries that were, or could have been, sustained as the result of family or domestic violence or other forms of assault for the period 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2008 I have found 6 cases only.
I do not consider this a reliable result because I believe there should be a substantially higher figure.
In relation to the information sought about clients aged under 16 years I have annexed a schedule of the information I have found by computer search.
This schedule is reasonably reliable and, I believe, represents almost all of the available information.
It might be that reading the progress notes would reveal other relevant cases.
...
The schedule is annexed hereto and marked "R[G]1".
" 
11 The schedule annexed to Nurse Gooley's affidavit listed the details of 12 patients including eight young Aboriginal girls.
Each of the eight young Aboriginal girls (except one) had received an Implanon contraceptive implant.
The details of those eight young Aboriginal girls, as set out in the schedule, were as follows:

The * indicates information that has been deleted to protect the patient's privacy.
12 On 20 May 2008, Mr Anderson issued the amended notice.
Before issuing the amended notice, he had an opportunity to consider the matters set out in the affidavits of Dr Bell and Nurse Rebecca Gooley.
Unlike the original notice, which was quite general in its terms, the amended notice was specifically limited to those persons described in paragraphs 7 and 8 of Nurse Gooley's affidavit (above).
