Notices of Appeal from the judgments of the learned Federal Magistrate were filed in this Court on 30 July 2008.
The husband's appeal is NSD 1192 of 2008 and the wife's appeal is NSD 1191 of 2008.
On 25 August 2008, I ordered that the two appeals be heard together.

The evidence before the Court on the hearing of the motions took the form of two affidavits sworn 27 August 2008 by the husband, one affidavit being filed in his application and the other in his wife's application.
In addition, certain documents were tendered which became exhibits A, B, C and 1, all of which were admitted into evidence without objection.
