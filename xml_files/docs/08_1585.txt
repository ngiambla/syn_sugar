 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 12 September 2007, the applicant was informed, by letter, that his employment with the respondent was terminated for misconduct.
The applicant lodged an application in this Court on 17 September 2007 alleging he was unlawfully dismissed because he was a member and delegate of the National Union of Workers of Australia (NUW).
He alleged his dismissal contravened s 792 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the WR Act).
An allegation was also made that he was dismissed for engaging in protected industrial action.
Dismissal for this reason is prohibited by s 448 of the WR Act.
2 The applicant sought interim relief under s 838 of the WR Act and s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
The application for interim relief was heard on 26 September 2007.
On 27 September 2007, I ordered that the applicant be reinstated to the position he formerly held with the respondent until further order or until determination of these proceedings: Rojas v Esselte Australia Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1506.
THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEME 
 
3 Before considering the evidence, it is desirable to say something briefly about the legislative scheme, although it will be discussed in more detail later in these reasons.
The applicant has made an application under s 807 of the WR Act alleging contravention of s 792 of the WR Act.
The applicant's case is that the respondent breached s 792(1) of the WR Act, which relevantly provides:
 
 An employer must not, for a prohibited reason, or for reasons that include a prohibited reason, do or threaten to do any of the following: 
 
 
 
 (a) dismiss an employee; 
 (b) ... 
 
 

4 Section 793 sets out the prohibited reasons for the purposes of the preceding section.
The applicant alleges that the termination of his employment on 12 September 2007 was done for a prohibited reason, or for reasons that included a prohibited reason, within the meaning of s 793(1)(a) of the WR Act , namely, that he was a member of and a delegate of an industrial organisation.
