 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 By orders of Kiefel J on 28 February 2005 the first respondent, Mr Bon Levi was restrained for a five year period from advertising any business for sale without, amongst other things, producing to a potential purchaser various documents.
The detail of this will be explained below.
The orders were made by consent but they followed a lengthy history of Mr Levi advertising and selling nonexistent or not profitable businesses and benefiting substantially from that process.
2 Although similar orders were also made against the second respondent, he is not the subject of these contempt proceedings.
3 Almost immediately after her Honour's orders were made, Mr Levi breached them.
Indeed, he continued to breach the orders by advertising further such businesses for sale, (as well as receiving funds as a result of such advertisements) after these contempt proceedings brought by the applicant, the ACCC were initiated.
4 Mr Levi is not young and is not in particularly good health.
Nevertheless, the ACCC contends that a substantial sentence of imprisonment is appropriate due to the nature of the contempts concerned.
For Mr Levi it has been argued that it is the first of any form of contempt of court even though it must be accepted that the conduct constituting the contempt bears a marked similarity to conduct for which Mr Levi has previously been imprisoned.
5 For reasons which appear below, I cannot accept that the series of contempts, as serious as they were, would warrant simply a suspended sentence of imprisonment.
I also consider that as a matter of law, previous criminal history pertaining to conduct very similar to that constituting the contempts may and in this instance, should, be taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty.
Equally, I do believe that there are considerations which would mitigate against a term of imprisonment as lengthy as that for which the ACCC contends.
BACKGROUND 
 
6 On 4 August 2004, the ACCC issued proceedings against Mr Bon Levi alleging contraventions of s 51AD and s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA).
These proceedings related to the sale by him of distributorships, mostly involving a business called 'Little Joe Snax'.
The distributorships purportedly sold involved the distribution of snack food products.
The conduct which those proceedings addressed took place between 1 August 2003 and 20 July 2004.
7 By consent, declarations and orders were made on 28 February 2005 by Kiefel J.
Her Honour declared that:
 
 
 (a) Mr Levi, in offering and entering into the various distribution agreements, was a franchisor and the agreements offered by him were franchise agreements;
 (b) Mr Levi had failed to comply with the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) in multiple respects in relation to each of the 65 franchise agreements in the schedule to the order, and on each such occasion contravened s 51AD of the TPA;
 (c) Mr Levi engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of s 52 of the TPA by representing that: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) he would secure a minimum of 75 retail outlets for each distributorship;
 (ii) he would pay each purchaser of a distributorship the amounts set out in their agreements;
 (iii) he would conduct a national advertising campaign to establish Little Joe Snax as a substantial competitor to major snack food brands in Australia;
 (iv) he was successfully operating a business of the type of the relevant distributorship which manufactured or acquired the product in question;
 (v) he was able to generate orders for the products in question which would ensure that for the term of each distribution agreement the distributor would have a minimum number of retail outlets to which to deliver the product;
 (vi) he would ensure that each distributor would receive a minimum weekly payment from him for the term of each agreement;
 (vii) he had reasonable grounds to believe that he had the means to make good his representations;
 (viii) he had exercised reasonable care and skill in making any forecasts;
 (ix) he had provided potential purchasers with all such information as to his personal history and business experience as required by law;
 (x) he had informed all potential purchasers of all matters known to him that might substantially limit, qualify or restrict his ability or capacity to perform his obligations under the agreements; and
 (xi) in the case of master distributorships for the distribution of beverages, he was able to source and contract for the supply of such beverages, including alcoholic beverages.

 
 

8 Additionally and also by consent her Honour ordered Mr Levi be restrained for a period of five years from the date of the orders from:
 
 
 (a) advertising, promoting or offering for sale;
 (b) knowingly participating in any other person advertising, promoting or offering for sale, 
 
any franchise, training business, distributorship, partnership or other business opportunity (a proposed agreement) unless: 
 
 (c) prior to doing those things, he had a 'solicitor's notice' (as to which, see below) and that notice was provided to each potential purchaser at least 3 days before entering into any binding agreement or accepting any payment; or
 (d) there were no 'proscribed circumstances' (as to which, see below).

 
A 'solicitor's notice' meant a certificate from a solicitor in which the solicitor: 
 
 (a) certified that the solicitor was currently on the roll and had a current practising certificate;
 (b) certified that he or she had been provided with the terms of the proposed agreement and annexed a copy of the terms of the proposed agreement to the certificate;
 (c) made certain statements required by the orders;
 (d) certified whether the solicitor considered the proposed agreement to be a franchise agreement;
 (e) certified that if the solicitor considered the proposed agreement to be a franchise agreement, that the solicitor has been provided with such disclosure documents as are required to be provided under the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) and annexed those documents to the notice;
 (f) certified that the solicitor considered that such disclosure documents comply in all respects with the Code; and
 (g) certified that the solicitor had considered all representations as to future matters in the proposed agreement and set out all matters and grounds relied on by the representors in making those representations.

 
'Proscribed circumstances' meant circumstances in which the proposed agreement involved an ongoing business relationship between the offeror and the purchaser and any one or more of the following: 
 
 (a) involved trade or commerce between Australia and places outside Australia;
 (b) involved trade or commerce among the States of Australia;
 (c) involved trade or commerce within a Territory of Australia, between a State and a Territory, or between two Territories;
 (d) involved trade or commerce by way of the supply of goods or services to the Commonwealth; or
 (e) was negotiated or entered into or carried out through the use of postal, telegraphic or telephonic services, including the use of the internet or of electronic funds transfer.

 

9 Further, her Honour ordered (also by consent) that Mr Levi be restrained for five years from:
 
 
 (a) selling or accepting payment or part payment for; or
 (b) knowingly participating in any other person selling or accepting part payment for;
 any proposed agreement unless either:
 (c) the business has been successfully conducted for at least 6 months prior to being offered for sale; or 
 
by para 11(d) of her Honour's orders to which reference appears below: 
 
 (d) at least 7 days prior to the earlier of entering into a binding agreement for the sale or accepting any payment whatsoever from a potential purchaser, [Mr Levi] has notified the potential purchaser in writing: 
 
 
 
 
 i. that he was the first respondent in these proceedings and provided the potential purchaser with a copy of these orders;
 ii.
that he had previously used the names Ronald Frederick Heelan, Ronald Frederick, Roddy Farrow, Brett Wyatt, Ronald White and Bon Levi;
 iii.
of full details of his actual experience and expertise in conducting or operating the business in question;
 iv.
if any product is to be supplied or distributed or promoted under the proposed agreement, whether there is in place a concluded contract in relation to the acquisition of that product by the respondent or the other person offering the proposed agreement;
 v. whether the proceeds from entering into the proposed agreement are to be, or are likely to be, applied to paying any entitlement or amount due to another person with whom the respondent has previously entered into an agreement substantially similar to the proposed agreement; and
 vi.
if the proposed agreement provides that any money will be paid to the purchaser at any time under the proposed agreement, what if any means, including bonds, deposits and bank guarantees, have been put in place to ensure all monies will be paid as they fall due.

 
 

10 Her Honour's orders were served on Mr Levi together with a covering letter which advised him of the consequences of non-compliance with the orders.
This took place in early March 2005.
11 On the same date that these orders were made (28 February 2005), Mr Levi was also sentenced in the Southport District Court in Queensland after pleading guilty to four counts of wilful false promise and one count of misappropriation with a circumstance of aggravation.
12 At the time he contravened the TPA in the manner which gave rise to her Honour's orders, Mr Levi had been on bail pending trial for the District Court offences.
He had been committed for trial in the District Court on 11 October 2002.
The ACCC make the point that notwithstanding being on bail in respect of the District Court charges, Mr Levi participated in the conduct which was the subject of her Honour's orders.
13 As a consequence of his conviction in the Southport District Court, Mr Levi was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 31/2 years.
It was suspended for 5 years after serving 1 year and 25 days in pre-sentence detention.
14 The stark similarity of the conduct giving rise to those convictions is evident from the sentencing remarks of Newton DCJ ( The Queen v Ronald Frederick (District Court, Criminal Jurisdiction, 28 February 2005) where his Honour said:
 Your offending behaviour involved your advertising and making representations in respect of the establishment and maintaining of a number of business enterprises, thus attracting the payment of moneys from people who responded to your advertisements.
Their responses, no doubt, were largely prompted by the so-called guarantees made by you that they would receive a certain amount of money each week together with a percentage of net profits.
Up to $800 per week and five per cent of net profits were, as I understand the outline of the Prosecutor, mentioned by you in respect of Kamp and similar amounts in respect of other complainants.
When the prospective purchasers or franchisees began to delve into matters that you had made representations to them about, it soon became apparent that the proposals really amounted to nothing more than a house of cards.
The weekly amounts were not paid, except in a couple of instances.
In other cases, cheques were dishonoured.
There were no net profits from which the clients could benefit.
Some $90,400, I am told, was received by you in respect of these matters but that sum excludes the small amounts that were received by them for wages.
... STATUTORY FRAMEWORK 
 
15 Section 31(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) provides that:
 
 
 (1) Subject to any other Act, the Court has the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the High Court.

 

16 By s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) it is provided that the High Court has the same power to punish contempts 'as is possessed as at the commencement of this Act by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England'.
The power of the English courts to punish for contempt of court as at the date of commencement of the Judiciary Act was limited to the power to fine or the power to imprison.
It has now been accepted that there are relatively minor variations of these two basic powers.
For example in Australian Competition  Consumer Commission v INFO4PC.com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 Nicholson J held:
 
 
 138 The Federal Court has a wide range of penalties open to it ( Australian Securities Investment Commission v Matthews [1999] FCA 803 ; (1999) 32 ACSR 404 at 411 ( ASIC v Matthews ) per Sackville J) and includes the power to:
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) commit a contemnor to prison for an indefinite period of time ( Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238 ; Flamingo Park Pty Ltd v Dolly Dolly Creation Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 123 ; (1985) 5 FCR 169 at 178 per Wilcox J);
 (b) to impose a fine for a wilful breach of an order or undertaking ( Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1986) at 109 --- 113; Flamingo Park Pty Ltd at 178 per Wilcox J);
 (c) to impose a daily fine ( Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union at 113 --- 115); and
 (d) to order the sequestration of the assets of a contemnor ( Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union at 115 --- 116); and 
 (e) to suspend on condition any sentence of imprisonment that it might impose in respect to contempt ( Australian Competition  Consumer Commission v Goldstar Corp Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 1441 ; ASIC v Matthews at 411).

 
 

17 Although there has been a passing suggestion to the contrary, it appears to be established that there is no power in the Federal Court to impose a community service order (a creature of statute) for the reasons expressed by Gray J in Pattison (Trustee), in the matter of Bell (Bankrupt) v Bell [2007] FCA 137 at 46-48.
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CONTEMPT CASES 
 
18 In Australian Competition  Consumer Commission v World Netsafe Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1501 ; (2003) 133 FCR 279 Spender J said at [16]: 
 Considerations which are relevant in deciding what is the appropriate penalty include: 
 
 (a) The relative seriousness of the contempt, which is determined by the extent to which the contemnor appreciated that a contempt was being committed: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Info4PC.com Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 949 ; (2002) 121 FCR 24 at [144] .
(b) Whether the contemnor subjectively intended to disobey the order: Attorney-General v Times Newspapers Ltd [1992] 1 AC 191 at 218; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Hughes [2001] FCA 38 ; [2001] ATPR 41-807 at [20] ; and Info4PCCom .
(c) The importance of bringing home to the contemnor the seriousness of the contempt: Hughes at [24]; Info4PCCom at [139].
(d) Whether the contemnor has offered any explanation or apology for his conduct: Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238 , per Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Brennan JJ at 245.
(e) An acknowledgment by the contemnor that a contempt was committed may be a mitigating factor: Matthews at [25] and [29].

 

19 In a similar vein, in the context of breach of the terms of a mareva order, Palmer J in Australian Securities  Investments Commission v Michalik [2004] NSWSC 1260 ; (2004) 52 ACSR 115 said at [29]:
 
 
 29 For present purposes the relevant factors to be considered may be summarised thus: 
 
 
 
 
 i) the seriousness of the contempt proved;
 ii) whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences to himself of what he proposed to do;
 iii) the actual or potential consequences of the contempt on the proceedings in which the contempt was committed;
 iv) whether the contempt was committed in the context of a proceeding alleging crime or conduct seriously prejudicial to the public interest: see, for example, Von Doussa v Owens (No 3) (1982) 31 SASR 166 ;
 v) the reason or motive for the contempt;
 vi) whether the contemnor has received, or sought to receive, a benefit or gain from the contempt;
 vii) whether there has been any expression of genuine contrition by the contemnor;
 viii) the character and antecedents of the contemnor;
 ix) what punishment is required to deter the contemnor and others of like mind from similar disobedience to the orders of the Court;
 x) what punishment is required to express the Court's denunciation of the contempt.

 
 

20 It is clear from the observations of Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 that the underlying rationale for the exercise of the contempt power is the necessity to uphold and protect the effective administration of justice.
Their Honour's said at 107:
 Although the primary purpose in committing a defendant who disobeys an injunction is to enforce the injunction for the benefit of the plaintiff, another purpose is to protect the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the court's orders will be enforced.
As the authors of Borrie and Lowe's Law of Contempt, 2nd ed (1983) say, at 3: 
 
 "If a court lacked the means to enforce its orders, if its orders could be disobeyed with impunity, not only would individual litigants suffer, the whole administration of justice would be brought into disrepute.
" 
 

21 Thus it was also observed in INFO4PC.com [2002] FCA 949 ; 121 FCR 24 at [141] a sentence for contempt is punitive and an order to vindicate the authority of the court.
22 As observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Globex Systems Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 550 at [59] - [60] a contempt may be technical where the contemnor has taken all reasonable steps to comply with the Court's orders notwithstanding which an unintentional breach has occurred or it may be wilful where the breach is something more than casual, accidental or unintentional.
As the ACCC submits is so in the present instance, it may be contumacious where the breach is a result of a deliberate act of defiance.
OFFERS TO SELL BUSINESSES 
 
23 As early as 5 March 2005, before the date of service of the orders of Kiefel J but at a time when he might reasonably be taken to have known of them given that he consented to them, Mr Levi commenced advertising opportunities for people to earn money in businesses around Australia.
Between 5 March 2005 and 27 May 2005 Mr Levi was responsible for advertising in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper such opportunities.
They were opportunities to purchase businesses.

26 The contempt charges as pursued by the ACCC are confined to the conduct of Mr Levi with five people who responded to such advertisements.
WARNINGS 
 
27 On 24 February 2006 Mr Launder for the ACCC wrote to Mr Levi alerting him to possible breaches of the orders.
Mr Launder received a response from Mr Levi dated 10 March 2006 in which Mr Levi wrote:
 'I truly believe that "I" BON LEVI are (sic) totally 100% complying with the orders made by the good judge on the 25th of February 2005.
Incidentally I was 'forced' into consenting to those orders by the ACCC and I intend to 'take up that matter when I take the "litigation" against yourself and the ACCC in the not to (sic) distant future...' 
28 A complaint was received by the ACCC that Mr Levi had been attempting to sell a distributorship for the sale of 'Hot Stuff Cassava and Cookies'.
Mr Launder, on behalf of the ACCC, also wrote again to Mr Levi in relation to that complaint on 22 March 2006.
On this occasion he again set out the terms of the Court orders.
On 31 March 2006, Mr Levi replied by letter accusing the complainants of being a party to a conspiracy of entrapment and corruption with the ACCC.
29 The ACCC submit and I accept that the tenor of this correspondence when considered together with the communications with other complainants, to which I will refer below, indicate, at least until the time of this hearing, an attitude of belligerence, aggression and arrogance on the part of Mr Levi.
30 Mr Levi has now pleaded guilty to the contempt charge and has accepted the correctness of the facts relied upon by the ACCC.
Those facts are as follows.
Mr Paul Sonego 
 
31 On about 17 December 2005, Mr Sonego read an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
It involved the sale of a distribution business.
The price was $19,500.
He telephoned the advertised number and spoke with Mr Levi.
Mr Levi told him that the business involved delivery of chips to a list of customers from the database.
In fact the business did not exist and therefore had never been successfully operated.
Mr Sonego had a number of other telephone conversations with Mr Levi.
On 23 December 2005, Mr Sonego completed an application form and obtained a bank cheque made payable to 'Bon Levi' for the sum of $2,145.
He sent those documents to Mr Levi.
On or about 31 January 2006, Mr Sonego obtained a further bank cheque for $19,305.
It also was payable to Bon Levi and together with a signed distribution agreement he forwarded the bank cheque and the agreement to Mr Levi.
In early February 2006, because Mr Levi had told Mr Sonego that the business was ready to commence, Mr Sonego purchased a new van at a price of $22,500 to use for the business.
32 Mr Sonego continued to write to and receive correspondence from Mr Levi up until late July 2006.
Increasingly over that period of time, Mr Sonego became concerned that there was no manifestation of the distribution business which had been advertised and which he had purchased.
The distribution business never commenced and Mr Sonego never received the customer list from Mr Levi.
He never received payments from Mr Levi.
Mr Levi never refunded the money to Mr Sonego despite request.
33 In more than a dozen letters and faxes sent to Mr Sonego in the period between December 2005 and July 2006, Mr Levi continued to make baseless and false claims about the commencement of the distribution business.
Mr Sonego was never informed by Mr Levi of the matters set out in par 11(d) of the orders of Kiefel J.
Mr Sonego's business had not been operated successfully for at least six months prior to its sale to Mr Sonego or indeed at all.
It follows that Mr Levi breached the requirements of par 11 of her Honour's orders in respect of the sale of the alleged distribution business to Mr Sonego.
34 At about this time, while the current correspondence ensued between Mr Sonego and Mr Levi, on 1 February 2006 Mr Guy Launder of the ACCC communicated with Mr Levi advising him that the ACCC had become aware that Mr Levi was continuing to advertise business opportunities.
Mr Launder sought confirmation from Mr Levi that he was complying with the orders of her Honour.
In a response which Mr Launder received from Mr Levi on 2 February 2006, Mr Levi told Mr Launder:
 Dealing with your allegation "You are advertising again" My statement is that this again like your 66 allegations of previous attack by the ACCC.
My statement is "Prove it!
(sic) Mr Vinko Jorgic and Mrs Daniela Jorgic 
 
35 At about the same time as these events were occurring, Mr Vinko Jorgic and Mrs Daniela Jorgic read advertisements in The Age newspaper on 4 February 2006.
These advertisements were in respect of a packaging food business being for sale for $40,000 and a delivery business being for sale for $19,500.
As with the other complainants, they responded to the advertisements.
They were sent Little Joe Snax marketing material together with application forms to buy the businesses.
36 They took steps to visit the Little Joe Snax 'factory' while they were on holiday on the Gold Coast.
After meeting the packager there and after further telephone conversations with Mr Levi, Mr Jorgic paid a deposit of $2,180 by way of a personal cheque made payable to Bon Levi and then on 28 March 2006 paid the remaining $19,270.
This payment was made by bank cheque to Bon Levi.
The payments were in respect of the purchase of the Little Joe Snax business.
So that they could pay for the business, Mr and Mrs Jorgic obtained funds by extending their mortgage over their family home by an additional $19,270.
They have paid interest on that amount since 20 March 2006.
Again, despite various communications with Mr Levi up until August 2006 in which further promises were made by him, Mr and Mrs Jorgic's business did not commence, no customer lists were received and Mr Levi did not repay them their money.
37 Mr and Mrs Jorgic were never informed of the matters set out in par 11(d) of the orders of Kiefel J and the business had not been successfully operated for at least six months prior to its sale to them and in fact had not operated at all.
It follows that once again Mr Levi is in breach of the requirements of par 11 of her Honour's orders in relation to the sale of the alleged distribution business to Mr and Mrs Jorgic.
Mr Thiyagarajah Thamorampillai 
 
38 Also at about this time, on 25 March 2006 Thiyagarajah Thamorampillai saw an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald for a distribution business.
It was for sale for the sum of $19,500.
Mr Thamorampillai responded to the advertisement.
He also had a number of telephone discussions with Mr Levi.
39 On or about 30 March 2006, Mr Thamorampillai paid a deposit of $1,950 for the Little Joe Snax distribution business.
He paid a further $19,500 on 28 April 2006.
Each of those cheques was made payable to 'Bon Levi'.
In order to make the payments to him Mr Thamorampillai used family savings and borrowed $6,000 from his father-in-law.
40 Once again, that distribution business did not exist and had not been successfully operated at all prior to Mr Thamorampillai purchasing it.
It did not succeed and after many discussions with Mr Levi, Mr Thamorampillai made unsuccessful attempts for his money to be refunded.
On no occasion was Mr Thamorampillai ever informed of the matters set out in par 11(d) of her Honour's orders.
It followed that Mr Levi was in breach of the requirements of par 11 of her Honour's orders in respect of the sale of the alleged distribution business to Mr Thamorampillai.
Mr John Eaton 
 
41 Mr John Eaton lives in Western Australia.
In early August 2006, Mr Eaton saw an advertisement in the Sunday Times newspaper published in Western Australia.
It advertised a 50% partnership in a gas conversion business.
The price for which the 50% partnership was being sold was $40,000.
The advertisement guaranteed income of $2,000 per week.
42 Mr Eaton responded to the advertisement and held several meetings with Mr Levi.
On 17 August 2006, Mr Eaton paid a deposit with a cheque made out to Bon Levi for $4,400.
On 5 September 2006, Mr Eaton made a further payment of $20,000 by cheque payable to Bon Levi.
Mr Eaton became concerned over the ensuing months when Mr Levi failed to supply the LPG tanks which he had promised and which were to be fitted to customer's cars.
On 5 October 2006, a month after the second substantial payment for the business, Mr Levi visited Mr Eaton's residence.
Mr Levi provided him there with a copy of the orders of Kiefel J dated 28 February 2005.
When Mr Levi handed him the orders, he said to Mr Eaton 'if anyone asks, I gave you this before you signed the agreement'.
43 This was the only occasion when Mr Levi provided a copy of her Honours orders to any of the complainants and, of course, at this stage Mr Levi already had Mr Eaton's payment for the supposed business.
44 At no stage did Mr Levi ever supply any gas conversion kits or tanks as he had previously promised Mr Eaton.
Moreover, at no stage did Mr Eaton ever receive any payments from Mr Levi.
Mr Levi never repaid any of the monies to Mr Eaton that Mr Eaton had paid for the purchase of the business.
45 Over and above the $24,400 Mr Eaton had paid Mr Levi, Mr Eaton also spent some $11,000 setting up a workshop and paid a bond of $2,860 for business premises from which the gas conversion business was to operate.
He also committed to the obligation of meeting monthly rental payments of $2,860.
At no time did the gas conversion business ever exist nor had it been successfully operated for six months or for any time at all prior to it being advertised and Mr Eaton's purchase of it.
At no time was Mr Eaton informed of the matters set out in par 11(d) of her Honour's orders prior to entry into the agreement to acquire an interest in the gas conversion business or prior to paying Mr Levi the purchase money.
The 'business' had not successfully operated for at least six months or at any time at all.
Once again, Mr Levi had breached the obligations of par 11 of her Honour's orders in respect of the sale of the interest in the gas conversion business.
Mr Justin Anzellino 
 
46 In late November 2007 some five months after the ACCC had filed the charge in these proceedings, Mr Justin Anzellino responded to a brochure which was left under his car windscreen wipers.
The brochure advertised for sale a partnership in a business known as 'Bikini Girls Massage'.
47 In early December 2007, Mr Anzellino met with Mr Levi to discuss the business.
He agreed to purchase a 25% share in the business and on 11 December 2007 he electronically transferred $12,000 into an account which had been nominated by Mr Levi.
A week later Mr Anzellino electronically transferred another $54,000 into that account.
48 Once again, the Bikini Girls Massage business which Mr Anzellino purchased had never commenced and Mr Anzellino has never received any income from the business.
No monies have been paid or refunded to Mr Anzellino.
At no time was Mr Anzellino informed of the matters set out in par 11(d) of her Honour's orders.
It follows, once again, that Mr Levi breached the requirement of par 11 of her Honour's orders in relation to the sale of the supposed massage business to Mr Anzellino.
THE STATEMENT OF CHARGE 
 
49 On 13 June 2007, the ACCC filed the notice of motion in these proceedings and statement of charge in the Federal Court alleging that Mr Levi had been in contempt of court for breach of the orders of her Honour.
Initially the proceedings were filed in the Queensland Registry but on 27 July 2007 the proceedings were transferred to the Western Australia Registry.
50 On 10 August 2007, Siopis J made directions in relation to Mr Levi's attempt to obtain legal aid.
Mr Levi had informed the Court that he proposed to seek a stay of proceedings on the basis that he expected to be unable to obtain legal representation.
51 On 30 October 2007, Mr Levi filed a notice of motion seeking to have these proceedings stayed pursuant to the principles in Dietrich v The Queen [1991] HCA 57 ; (1992) 177 CLR 292 ( Dietrich application ) .
That Dietrich application was set down to be heard on 30 January 2008.
MR LEVI'S ANTECEDENTS 
 
52 On the same day that Kiefel J's orders were made, Mr Levi was convicted in the Queensland District Court of four counts of wilful promise with intent to defraud and one count of misappropriation of monies with a circumstance of aggravation for which he was sentenced to 3 1/2 years imprisonment suspended after one year and 25 days.
Mr Levi has also been imprisoned in the United States for three years for fraud offences.
He has been sentenced to at least two substantial periods, one of two years and one of two years and eight months of imprisonment for other fraud offences in South Australia.
He has previously been imprisoned for a period of three years by this Court for failing to pay a fine imposed upon him in respect of convictions of making misleading representations about business activities.
He has also been sentenced to a twelve month sentence in Western Australia for false pretences.
There is a similarity in all of those offences without needing to go back to his original criminal history which has been outlined below.
53 The ACCC rely upon Mr Levi's record of previous convictions and imprisonment for offences concerning dishonesty and other offences, but principally on the offences concerning dishonesty.
That record is as follows:
 Date Charges of which convicted Penalty 28.2.05 4 counts of wilful false promise with intent to defraud (Qld)
1 count of misappropriation of monies with a circumstance of aggravation (Qld) 3 1/2 years imprisonment, suspended after 1 year and 25 days (pre-sentence detention) for a period of 5 years 1998 Mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud (US --- Missouri) 3 years and one month imprisonment 25.1.93 Obtaining a benefit by false pretences (SA) 2 years, 8 months and 17 days imprisonment, to be served concurrently with time served pursuant to Federal Court Order below 12.9.90 Offering or inviting for subscription to the public a prescribed interest (SA) 2 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 months and a suspended sentence bond for 2 years 7.5.90 6 charges of failing to pay tax deductions as an employer (SA) Fined $1,500 on each count.

Fined $60,000 and in the event that not paid before 20 March 1991, to serve one day's imprisonment for each $25 not paid.
Mr Levi failed to pay $50,000 of the fine and on 22.4.91, a warrant for commitment was issued by the Federal Court to imprison him for 3 years.

12.2.63 Stealing (WA) 1 month's imprisonment BANKRUPTCY 
 
54 Mr Levi had failed to meet a costs award of $38,000 made against him by Kiefel J in the proceedings which were the subject of her Honour's orders.
On 15 June 2006, the ACCC commenced bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Levi in respect of that failure and on 27 September 2006, a sequestration order was made by this Court against Mr Levi.
The date of his bankruptcy was 26 July 2006.
This was about the time that Mr Levi left Queensland and commenced living in Perth, Western Australia.
55 In several cases, but not all, it has been held that in circumstances where a contemnor is bankrupt, a fine would be inappropriate, inadequate, or impossible.
To the extent those authorities include State courts it is to be noted that State courts may be affected by the operation of detailed sentencing legislation.
There is no such Act covering federal jurisdiction (see Re Colina; Ex parte Torney [1999] HCA 57 ; (1999) 200 CLR 386 , as applied by Gray J in Pattison [2007] FCA 137 at [47] - [48] , in determining the inapplicability of the sentencing principles contained in the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)).
56 Decided in the Federal Court, Ambrose (trustee), Re; Athanasas (bankrupt) (No 2) [2008] FCA 1016 is a case concerning a bankrupt person who repeatedly failed to produce documents on summons.
He pleaded guilty to failing to comply with statutory obligations to produce documents and failing to comply with an undertaking given to the Court by his then solicitor.
In determining whether a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate, Lander J stated (at [63]-[64]):
 It is accepted that a sentence of imprisonment is a punishment of last resort.
However, it is a punishment which must be imposed if it is necessary for the purpose of vindicating the Court's authority.
In this case, Mr Athanasas is a bankrupt and it would seem to me that a fine would be inappropriate.
Notwithstanding that imprisonment is a sentence of last resort, it seems to me, having regard to the conduct of Mr Athanasas over a very long period since the matter first came before the Registrar and since he first informed the Registrar he would comply with the summons, a sentence of imprisonment is necessary.
57 His Honour also considered (at [65]-[66]) whether or not the sentence should be suspended:
 Mr Telfer [counsel for Mr Athanasas] urged me to suspend the sentence on condition that Mr Athanasas produce the documents within a period specified in the condition.
The difficulty with that submission is that he has no instructions that his client will produce the documents.
I specifically asked him whether he was in a position to tell the Court whether Mr Athanasas would produce the documents to the Court at any time in the future.
His instructions were that he had no such instructions.
It is necessary, in my opinion, to reassert the Court's authority and, in those circumstances, I am not prepared to suspend the sentence of imprisonment.
58 Mr Athanasas was accordingly sentenced to three months' imprisonment.
59 In Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 3) [2006] FCA 397 ; (2006) 230 ALR 528 Merkel J considered principles relevant to the question of penalty for contempt, citing from his earlier reasons in Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494.
60 In this case, the contemnor was an undischarged bankrupt.
Merkel J observed at 531:
 There is no evidence that Siminton has any capacity to pay a fine and the interlocutory orders made in the proceeding prevent him from accessing any of the funds upon which he might otherwise lawfully draw upon to pay any fine.
In all the circumstances, the imposition of a fine on Siminton is not likely to have a significant effect upon him and, in any event, would be insufficient to vindicate the authority of the court in respect of the disposal contempts.
61 In that case, there was no evidence that the contemnor had displayed any regret, remorse or contrition in respect of his contempts.
His Honour observed at 532:
 I accept that imprisonment should be a last resort but, having regard to the circumstances outlined above, I am in no doubt that in relation to the disposal contempts a term of imprisonment is both appropriate and necessary to vindicate the court's authority.
I regard personal deterrence as remaining a significant factor but I regard general deterrence as being of particular importance in the present case...
In my view, the object of general deterrence in the present case requires that a penalty be imposed that protects the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the court's orders cannot be disobeyed with impunity...
The court has a broad discretion as to penalty.
Having regard to the factors set out above and the matters put forward by counsel on behalf of Siminton, the appropriate term of imprisonment for the disposal contempts is 10 weeks.
I would add that had there been any prior contempt convictions, the penalty would have been significantly greater.
I am also not prepared to accede to Siminton's submission that any sentence of imprisonment should be suspended.
In the present case, there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to justify suspending the sentence.
62 In Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 11) [2007] FCA 1815 it had been found that the respondent had committed contempt of court by failing to pay a fine imposed on him by a Full Court within the time stipulated.
