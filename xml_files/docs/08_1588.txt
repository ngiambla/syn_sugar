 
 1 On 5 July 2006, Review 2 Pty Ltd (in liquidation) ("Review 2") was registered as the owner of Design Registration No 307708 ("the Review Design") under the Designs Act 2003 (Cth) ("the Designs Act ").
2 On 28 February 2007, as part of a corporate restructure, Review 2 transferred its business and ownership of the Review Design to Review Australia Pty Ltd ("Review"), which was at that time known as Review Holdings Pty Ltd. On 13 June 2007, Review 2 appointed liquidators for the purpose of a members' voluntary winding up pursuant to Div 2 of Pt 5.5 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
This is an action for design infringement and a cross-claim for design invalidity.
For the reasons stated below, I would dismiss both the action for infringement and the cross-claim for invalidity.
3 Review 2 and Review allege that Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd ("Redberry") made, imported and sold a dress in infringement of the Review Design.
Various forms of relief are sought, including declaratory and injunctive relief, and damages.
Three principal questions arise:
 
(1) Has Redberry infringed the Review Design?
(2) Is the Review Design valid?
(3) If yes to these two questions, how should damages be assessed?
