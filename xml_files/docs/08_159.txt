 
1 This proceeding concerns the question of whether two taxpayers who overpaid goods and services tax ( GST ) to the Commissioner of Taxation are entitled to recover the overpaid GST.
It raises a question as to the construction of s 105-65 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ( the Administration Act ) and a question as to whether the taxpayers should, as a condition of being entitled to recover the overpaid GST, be required to account for the refunded amount to persons who paid the amount of the GST to the taxpayers.
2 The proceeding has been conducted on the basis of agreed facts.
The parties have posed two specific questions for the Court on the basis that the outcome of the proceeding will be determined by the answers to those questions.
RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
 
3 The pivotal concepts for the operation of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) ( the GST Act ) are taxable supplies and creditable acquisitions .
Section 7-1(1) of the GST Act relevantly provides that GST is payable on taxable supplies and s 7-1(2) relevantly provides that entitlements to input tax credits arise on creditable acquisitions .
Amounts of GST and input tax credits are set off against each other to produce a net amount for a tax period.
Under s 7-15, the net amount in a tax period is the amount that a taxpayer must pay to the Commonwealth or that the Commonwealth must refund to the taxpayer, in respect of the period.
The net amount is ascertained by deducting the amount of input tax credits from the amount of GST.
