 
 1 On 21 May 2008 a departure prohibition order (DPO) at least purportedly made by one Raelene Susan Vivian, a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and delegate of the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner), pursuant to s 14S of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (TAA) was directed to the Applicant, Mr Ron Pattenden.
It is necessary to state "at least purportedly" because one of the issues in this case is whether that DPO was made by Ms Vivian either at all or lawfully.
2 Mr Pattenden has instituted an appeal to this Court pursuant to s 14V of the TAA against the making of the DPO.
3 So far as presently relevant, s 14S and s 14V of the TAA respectively provide:
 
 
 14S Departure prohibition orders
 
 (1) Where: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a person is subject to a tax liability; and
 (b) the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that it is desirable to do so for the purpose of ensuring that the person does not depart from Australia for a foreign country without: 
 
 
(i) wholly discharging the tax liability; or (ii) making arrangements satisfactory to the Commissioner for the tax liability to be wholly discharged; 
 
 the Commissioner may, by order in accordance with the prescribed form, prohibit the departure of the person from Australia for a foreign country.

 
 
 
 14V Appeals to courts against making of departure prohibition orders
 
 
 
 
 
 (1) A person aggrieved by the making of a departure prohibition order may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of a State or Territory against the making of the departure prohibition order.
(2) This section has effect: 
 
 
(a) subject to chapter III of the Constitution ; and (b) notwithstanding anything contained in section 9 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 .
4 The regime in the TAA for the making of a DPO replaced, after an interval of some 22 years, a longstanding, more sweeping regime for the restriction of departure of persons from Australia while subject to a taxation liability, the last manifestation of which was found in the former ss 210 to 212A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (ITAA36).
Under the earlier regime any person about to leave Australia had to obtain from the Commissioner a certificate which attested either to an absence of income tax liability or to the making of satisfactory arrangements for the payment of all income tax that was or might become payable by the person.
Apart from criminal sanctions, an owner or charterer of a ship or aircraft who issued an authority to travel to a person who had not presented such a taxation certificate was made personally liable for the tax, if any, for which that person was or might become liable.
Provision was made for the lodgement with the Commissioner before departure by a ship or aircraft owner or charterer of passenger lists and taxation clearance certificates.
5 Unsurprisingly, with the increasing advent on and from the 1960s of international travel and related tourism, this blanket regime became increasingly impractical, a circumstance confirmed by regard to the Ministerial Second Reading Speech made by the then Treasurer, the Rt Hon Harold Holt, in 1962 in respect of the Bill proposing the repeal of the regime.
Though the potential for some revenue loss was there acknowledged, a countervailing benefit was considered to exist in the benefits that it would bring in facilitating international tourism to Australia.
Sections 210 to 212A were repealed in 1962 upon the enactment of the Bill.
6 The utility of there being some provision for the restriction of the ability of a tax debtor to depart Australia without either wholly discharging the debt and prospective debts or making arrangements satisfactory to the Commissioner for that discharge came to commend itself to Parliament in 1984 when Part IVA , in which s14S and s 14V are found, was inserted into the TAA.
7 Though termed an "appeal", a proceeding under s 14V of the TAA either in this Court or a State or Territory Supreme Court, each of which is concurrently invested with Federal jurisdiction for this purpose, is a proceeding in the original jurisdiction.
Features of such an appeal were considered by the Full Court in Poletti v Commissioner of Taxation (1994) 52 FCR 154 (Poletti's Case).
Poletti's Case remains the only appellate authority in relation to such appeals.
Not all of the decisions in the exercise of original jurisdiction which preceded Poletti's Case are readily reconcilable with that case or each other in relation to the nature of an appeal under s 14V.
8 The following propositions emerge from Poletti's Case in relation to this type of "appeal":
 
(a) the appeal is not a hearing de novo , which means that there is no retrial of all the issues and what the Commissioner considered and did in making the DPO decision is not irrelevant (at 160);
 
(b) neither is an appeal against the making of a DPO confined to a question of law in the way in which is an appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (at 160);
 
(c) nor is the appeal one confined to administrative law error grounds in a way in which would be a challenge under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (at 160);
 
(d) administrative law error grounds or a question of law may nonetheless permissibly be advanced on an appeal which, to this extent, overlaps with a judicial review proceeding (at 160);
 
(e) it is for an appellant to make good the challenge; no onus of proof lies on the Commissioner (at 160-161);
 
(f) the documentary material before the Commissioner at the time when the decision was made should be produced by him to the Court (at 161);
 
(g) other material then in existence, be it on the Commissioner's files or otherwise, is relevant and can be produced to the Court to enable the Court to decide whether the belief of the Commissioner was held on reasonable grounds (at 162);
 
(h) material which comes to light after the making of the DPO decision and which did not exist at that time is of doubtful relevance (at 162).
9 In Poletti's Case at 160, the Full Court considered that an appeal against the making of a DPO involves the determination by the Court of three principal questions (or such one or more of them as are in issue in the appeal):
 
(a) whether the person is subject to a tax liability;
 
(b) whether the Commissioner held the belief of which s 14S(1)(b) speaks; and
 
(c) whether reasonable grounds existed for the formation by the Commissioner of the requisite belief?
There questions provide a convenient framework within which to commence consideration of the merits of this appeal.
10 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Pattenden that there were two stages to an appeal under s 14V; deciding whether, on the evidence, the three questions posed in Poletti's Case ought to be answered in favour of the appellant on the material before the decision-maker and then deciding whether, on that material and such further material as then existed, reasonable grounds existed.
11 The Commissioner's submission was that there were no such "stages".
I agree.
12 There is nothing in Poletti's Case which supports the notion that there are two stages to the answering of the identified questions.
As noted above, it is recognised in Poletti's Case that, while it is possible to challenge the decision to make a DPO on administrative law error grounds, an appellant is not confined to the making of a challenge on such a basis.
For example, to be able to contend that, on the evidence before the Court as to the position at the time the decision was made, reasonable grounds did not exist, it is not first necessary to demonstrate that reasonable grounds did not exist on the material which was before the Commissioner or that the decision as made was tainted by some administrative law error.
Was Mr Pattenden subject to a taxation liability?

 
13 The schedule to the DPO recites that Mr Pattenden is indebted to the Commonwealth in respect of income tax and administrative penalty for tax shortfall in the total amount of $6,435,103.31.
In the main, the recited income tax liability and related administrative penalty is referable to a series of amended assessments which issued on 25 January 2008.
These assessments were in respect of the 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 income years.
So far as income tax liability is concerned, the schedule also makes reference to a net amount of $12,197.77 ($15, 582.85 less payments or credits of $3,475.08) remaining outstanding under an original assessment dated 16 April 2007 in respect of the 2006 income year.
14 It emerged in the course of the hearing that Mr Benson, the officer within the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to whom the submission for the making of the DPO was directed, was not informed of the amount outstanding under the original 2006 income year assessment or, for that matter, of a payment or credit of $26,390.08 in respect of the amended assessment for the 2005 income year which is also noted in the schedule to the DPO.
References to this net liability and to this payment or credit were added after Mr Benson had considered the submission by unnamed persons in the "Debt Management" branch of the ATO who seem to have prepared the draft of what became the schedule to the DPO.
There was no evidence that, after he had considered the submission on 21 April 2008 and before the DPO was issued in the name of Ms Vivian a month later, the entries in the schedule were ever drawn to Mr Benson's attention.
In all other respects, the amounts shown in the schedule to the DPO are reconcilable with the tax liability figures set out in the submission made to Mr Benson.
15 I consider the ramifications of the additions to the liability position known to Mr Benson later in these reasons for judgment.
16 Copies, authenticated by the signature of a Deputy Commissioner, of each of the notices of assessment in respect of the various assessments or amended assessments which appear in the schedule to the DPO were each in evidence.
17 Also in evidence was a series of deemed assessments which, by the operation of s 166A of the ITAA36, were occasioned upon the lodgement with the ATO on (as was conceded) 30 April 2008 by Crown Insurance Services Limited (Crown Insurance), a company incorporated in Vanuatu, of income tax returns for the income years ended 30 June 2003 to 30 June 2006 inclusive.
It transpired that Crown Insurance later paid the amounts of these deemed assessments.
This payment did not occur until after the date when the DPO was issued.
18 The submission to Mr Benson made reference to an audit which the ATO had conducted and was continuing to conduct of the taxation affairs of Mr Pattenden and companies with which he was associated.
Crown Insurance is mentioned in this regard.
It is described in the submission as "Mr Pattenden's underwriting company" and the recipient of the net amounts of premiums (net of salaries and other costs) collected in Australia from members of various Aboriginal communities in respect of funeral benefit insurance plans by other companies with which Mr Pattenden was associated (of which more detail below).
19 Though, on 21 April 2008, Mr Benson had this general awareness of the position of Crown Insurance as known to the ATO, it was not thereafter and prior to the issuing of the DPO drawn to his attention that Crown Insurance had lodged tax returns which resulted in its being deemed to be assessed for the 2003 to 2006 income years.
20 Mr Benson's understanding was that the amended assessments which were issued to Mr Pattenden in January 2008 were cast by reference to the amounts of premiums which had been sent to Crown Insurance from Australia and upon the assumption that he was in some way or another able to enjoy the use of this income.
The returns lodged by Crown Insurance return the net amounts of the premium income as taxable income of that company.
21 Unbeknown to Mr Benson at the time when he considered the DPO submission or at any time thereafter before the issuing of the DPO, Mr Pattenden had, on 11 April 2008, lodged objections to each of the amended assessments.
In each case, the grounds of objection were that the taxable income assessed was income of Crown Insurance, not Mr Pattenden and, further or alternatively, that Mr Pattenden was not, in any of the income years in question, a resident of Australia for income tax purposes.
Those objections had not been determined by the Commissioner at the time when the DPO was issued.
22 On behalf of Mr Pattenden it was submitted that the existence of a "genuine dispute" was a relevant consideration not taken into account.
It was further submitted that another relevant consideration not taken into account was the ATO "receivables policy".
23 Originally, these submissions were made in conjunction with a submission that the issuing of the DPO was unlawful because it sought the double recovery of a taxation liability in respect of income which had also been assessed to Crown Insurance.
I did not understand this particular submission to be pressed given that Crown Insurance had only paid the amounts of its deemed assessments after the date when the DPO issued.
In that circumstance, the abandonment of the submission was appropriate.
24 The Commissioner is entitled to raise alternative assessments.
What he is not entitled to do is twice or more to recover tax in respect of the same income.
The prevailing position was summarised and pertinent authorities were collected by Brennan J (as his Honour then was) in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1994-1995) 183 CLR 168 at 202:
 The appropriateness of alternative assessments to tax of two taxpayers in respect of the same item of income was recognized in a dictum of this Court in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v. Moorebank Pty.
Ltd. And the courts, if not the Commissioner, can diminish the difficulty of concurrent assessments by ensuring that there is no double recovery of tax.
The co-existence of tax liabilities arising from concurrent assessments is entirely consistent with the operation of s 177(1).
If the Commissioner employs s 177(1) in a proceeding to recover tax from taxpayer A, the liability of that taxpayer cannot be avoided by pointing to an outstanding assessment against taxpayer B.
Section 177(1) operates as between the Commissioner and the taxpayer served with the notice of assessment in a proceeding between them and the notice of assessment issued to another taxpayer does not qualify or affect the operation of s 177(1).
(Footnote references omitted) See also to like effect in that same case the reasons for judgment of Dawson J at p 216-217 and of Toohey J at p 228.
The relevant root authority is Richardson v Commissioner of Taxation [1932] HCA 67 ; (1932) 48 CLR 192.
25 Had Crown Insurance paid the deemed assessments prior to the making of the DPO and either this fact not drawn to the attention of Mr Benson or if it had and its implications had not been taken into account in considering the extent to which Mr Pattenden's tax liability had thereby been discharged, there may have been a basis for the submission which came not to be pressed but it is unnecessary to decide the point.
The mere fact that Mr Benson was unaware that deemed assessments existed in respect of Crown Insurance had no impact on the reaching of a conclusion that Mr Pattenden was subject to a taxation liability that had not been wholly discharged.
I consider below whether there is any other ramification of his ignorance of the deemed assessments.
26 There was no suggestion that bad faith on the part of the Commissioner or his staff attended the issuing of the amended assessments to Mr Pattenden in January 2008.
The production and tender in evidence of the authenticated copies of those amended assessments and the other assessment establishes conclusively in this appeal that those assessments were duly made and that the amount and all particulars of each assessment are correct: s 177(1) ITAA36.
27 Upon the production and tender of the authenticated copies of the amended and other assessments, that Mr Pattenden was subject to a taxation liability became a given in this appeal.
Section 177 of the ITAA36 operated "to change what would otherwise be the operation of the relevant laws of evidence": Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation Ltd [2008] HCA 32 ; (2008) 82 ALJR 1177 at 1191, [65] .
In these circumstances and to adapt, in light of subsequent legislative changes to the forums in which taxation appeals or reviews are heard, language employed by Lee J of the New South Wales Supreme Court in 1985 in Winter v Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 16 ATR 977 at 981, one of the first appeals of the present kind, it is not for a court entertaining an appeal against a DPO to usurp the function of the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal when deciding an appeal against or, as the case may be, when reviewing, an objection decision in respect of an assessment.
There was, even in 1985, nothing new in such a conclusion.
A like position prevailed by virtue of the effect of s 177(1) of the ITAA36 in respect of recovery related proceedings arising under the earlier regime for the restriction of the departure from Australia of taxation debtors: Re Scottish Loan  Finance Co Ltd (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 461 at 466-467 (Nicholas CJ in Eq).
28 For the purposes of this proceeding it must be accepted that Mr Pattenden was subject to total taxation liabilities of $6,435,103.31 in the way particularised in the schedule to the DPO at the time when the DPO issued.
So much in the end seemed to be accepted in the submissions made on his behalf.
29 As to the submissions concerning the relevance, if any, of the there being an objection and of the "receivables policy", neither can go to the existence of a taxation liability.
That being so and because of the way the submissions came to be developed, it is preferable to consider their merits under a separate heading, "Residual Discretions?
" later in these reasons.
Did the Commissioner hold the requisite belief?

 
30 I have no doubt that Mr Benson held the belief on 21 April 2008 that it was desirable to make a DPO for the purpose of ensuring that Mr Pattenden did not depart from Australia for a foreign country without either wholly discharging his tax liability, as Mr Benson then understood it to be, or making arrangements satisfactory to the Commissioner for that tax liability wholly to be discharged.
In this sense, elements of s 14S(1)(b) of the TAA were addressed in his decision-making process.
31 Mr Benson's response to the submission made to him by subordinate officers is brief, "I support your recommendation to seek a DPO for Mr Pattenden".
Read in the context of the submission and related recommendation made by subordinate officers, the response is consistent only with his holding the belief that I have mentioned.
I do not read the words "I support" as evidencing Mr Benson's endorsing an approval decision made by an unauthorised subordinate, as opposed to evidencing his making a decision in terms of the subordinate's recommendation.
32 There was some exploration of Mr Benson's state of mind in cross examination and a related endeavour to persuade that his interest was only in securing the immediate payment of the income tax component of the debt rather than as well the additional tax.
The end to which that was directed was a submission that Mr Benson's belief was not related wholly to discharging his taxation liability.
That is not consistent with the contemporary evidence in the quoted response to the submission.
33 Though an officer of some seniority within the ATO, Mr Benson was neither the Commissioner nor a Deputy Commissioner and delegate of the Commissioner.
After Mr Benson saw and approved on 21 April 2008 the submission made to him in relation to the making of a DPO a month elapsed before it was issued.
Further, as noted above, when the DPO issued it made reference to a particular taxation liability of which Mr Benson was ignorant when he decided that a DPO should be made.
34 The submission for the making of the DPO was authored on 11 April 2008 by Mr Sivasubramaniam, an officer with particular responsibility for the audit of the income tax affairs of Mr Pattenden and entities related to him.
That day, Mr Sivasubramaniam dispatched the submission by email to his "Team Leader", Mr Roberts.
Later that day, Mr Roberts forwarded the submission to Mr Benson by email, adding the following comments:
 Our audits are continuing for this client and he now owes a significant amount of tax.
Also he has shown intentional disregard of the law.
Accordingly, I agree that this client represents a serious flight risk and that he has demonstrated this by the resent [sic] disposal of several major assets.
Please support [Mr Sivasubramaniam's] submission to issue a [DPO].
35 An allegation that Mr Pattenden represented a flight risk is made in the DPO submission.
36 Mr Benson then considered the submission and replied directly to Mr Sivasubramaniam on 21 April 2008 in terms already noted.
On the evidence, it was Mr Sivasubramaniam who thereafter came to affix the facsimile signature of the then Deputy Commissioner of Taxation Micro-enterprises and Individuals, Ms Vivian to the draft of the DPO, which issued in her name.
37 A draft of the proposed DPO did not form part of the submission made to Mr Benson.
While so to do may be good public administration and perhaps obviate the vices I describe below, there is nothing in s 14S which mandates that practice, as opposed to the decision-maker's having an awareness of the taxation liability and considering the other elements set out in s 14S.
38 Why it took a month after Mr Benson had decided that a DPO should be made to issue the DPO was not explained in evidence.
Mr Sivasubramaniam was not called to give evidence.
It would seem, with respect, to be antithetical to the very purpose of a DPO for a subordinate not forthwith to carry into effect a decision by the Commissioner, a delegate or an authorised person (in the name of the former) to make a DPO.
A need for expedition once a DPO is made is recognised by Parliament, having regard to the terms of s 14S(4) and (5) of the TAA:
 
 
 (4) Where a departure prohibition order is made in respect of a person, the Commissioner shall forthwith: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) cause the person to be informed, as prescribed, of the making of the order; and
 (b) subject to subsection (5), cause a copy of the order, and such information as the Commissioner considers is likely to facilitate the identification of the person, to be given to: 
 
 
(i) the Secretary to the Immigration Department; and (ii) such other persons as the Commissioner considers appropriate, being persons prescribed, or included in a class of persons prescribed, for the purposes of this paragraph.

 
 (5) Where a departure prohibition order is made in respect of a person whom the Commissioner is satisfied is an Australian citizen, the Commissioner shall not cause a copy of the order, or any information likely to facilitate the identification of the person, to be given to the Secretary to the Immigration Department unless the Commissioner is of the opinion that it is desirable to do so.

 

The word "forthwith" means as soon as reasonably practical.
That same sentiment of expedition applies to what should be the procedural or "ministerial" act of giving form to the decision to make a DPO.
I am not satisfied that this is what occurred in this instance.
39 Events did not remain static in the interval between 21 April and 21 May 2008.
I have already mentioned the Crown Insurance deemed assessments.
Further, there was correspondence generated on behalf of the Commissioner by Mr Sivasubramaniam with Mr Pattenden in relation to the provision of information further to what was termed an "Interim Decision Summary Report 2" which had been furnished to Mr Pattenden in early April 2008.
In that report, the prospect of raising of further amended assessments directed to Mr Pattenden in the total sum, inclusive of penalties, of $1.69 million was foreshadowed.
The existence of that interim report and that contingency were mentioned in the submission made to Mr Benson.
There is no mention of the decision to make the DPO in this correspondence.
Yet further, as described below, an explanatory letter in respect of one identified in the DPO submission as a concern was received by the ATO.
40 Tendered in evidence was an instrument of delegation signed by the Commissioner pursuant to s 8 of the TAA delegating, materially, his power to make a DPO to, inter alia , the holder of the office of Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Micro-enterprises and Individuals.
Also tendered was an instrument of authorisation by the holder of the office of Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Micro-enterprises and Individuals which, materially and at least purportedly, authorised the holder of the position held by Mr Benson to exercise in the name of the person for the time being holding the office of Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Micro-enterprises and Individuals the power of making a DPO.
Persons holding positions subordinate to that held by Mr Benson were not so authorised.
41 In terms of Australian jurisprudence, the lawfulness in particular circumstances of a practice within public administration of delegates of a responsible Minister or permanent head or equivalent such as the Commissioner authorising subordinates to exercise delegated powers in their name finds recognition at ultimate appellate level in O'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria Commissioners [1983] HCA 47 ; (1982-1983) 153 CLR 1 at 12-14 per Gibbs CJ, Murphy J agreeing in this regard and at 30-33 per Wilson J.
It is also the subject of an influential advisory opinion given by Brennan J in his Honour's then capacity as President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Reference under Ombudsman Act s 11 (1979) 2 ALD 86.
These, in turn, give local recognition to a principle of public law in the United Kingdom in relation to the administration of large Departments of State which has come to be known as "the Carltona principle", so named for a leading authority on the subject in that country, Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R 560.
These and other authorities on the subject are helpfully collected and discussed in Aronson, Dyer and Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action , 3rd Edition, at pp 310-318.
42 Whether it is lawful for a power consigned by statute to a designated person (or a delegate where there is provision for delegation) to be exercised in the name of that person by a duly authorised subordinate depends on whether the statute concerned requires the power personally to be exercised by its designated repository (or a delegate).
That, in turn, depends on the nature of the power and the other circumstances of the case.
The latter include considerations of whether one should assume knowledge by Parliament of factors going to practical administrative necessity for such authority to be exercised such as the size of the department for which the legislatively designated repository of a power is responsible, the geographic area for which the department is responsible and the apprehended frequency of the occasion for the exercise of the power concerned.
43 I am relieved from considering whether authorisation in accordance with the Carltona principle was possible at all in relation to the making of a DPO because it was not submitted that the power to make a DPO, though described in Poletti's Case (at 160) as a "severe intrusion into a person's liberty, privacy and freedom of movement", was of such a nature as to require the decision personally to be made by the Commissioner or a delegate.
It was accepted by the Appellant that it was permissible for the authorised person to decide to make the DPO with that decision being the act of the delegate.
44 The submission made on behalf of Mr Pattenden was that, accepting that the regime of delegation and authorisation was lawfully possible, it was not permissible for the authorised person, in turn, to consign substantive aspects of the making of the decision to subordinates.
It was, rightly, no part of that submission that it was impermissible for an authorised person such as Mr Benson, having made a decision to make a DPO, to consign to a subordinate consequential, wholly procedural, clerical or "ministerial" tasks such as the affixing of a facsimile of the Deputy Commissioner's signature to the DPO or the communication to Mr Pattenden of the making of the DPO.
Rather, the submission was that, when one examined the facts of this case, the decision as made and evidenced by the DPO was not that of Mr Benson in all key respects.
45 Two authorities were principally relied upon, Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 147 ALR 673 (Wilcox J) and passages in the dissenting judgment of Mason J (as his Honour then was) in O'Reilly's Case, supra.
Din's Case though was determined on a basis not relied upon for Mr Pattenden i.e.
that the nature of the statutory power and administrative necessity were not such as to make it impractical for decisions personally to be made by the Minister and his appointed delegates.
The dissent of Mason J in O'Reilly's Case was influenced by similar considerations.
46 The authorities relied upon do not directly support the submission, which is not to say that it lacks merit.
The essential point advanced was that, in permitting a decision by an authorised officer to make a DPO in the name of the delegate, the law did not thereby allow the authorised officer to give a blanket authority to an unauthorised officer to affix, at some uncertain time in the future, the signature of the delegate to a DPO in respect of whatever the total tax liability of the recipient might then be and irrespective of whatever other changes may have occurred in the interval.
47 Paragraph 14S(1)(a) uses the indefinite article to qualify "tax liability".
"Tax liability" is defined by s 2 of the TAA to mean "a liability to the Commonwealth arising under, or by virtue of, a taxation law".
In turn, s 2 defines "taxation law" by reference to the definition of that term in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (ITAA97).
Section 995.1 of the ITAA97 provides:
 "taxation law" means: 
 
 (a) an Act of which the Commissioner has the general administration (including a part of an Act to the extent to which the Commissioner has the general administration of the Act); or 
 (b) regulations under such an Act (including such a part of an Act).

 

48 The language of s 14S does not compel a conclusion a DPO may only be made after a consideration of the total taxation liabilities, howsoever arising, of an individual.
No intention which would displace the interpretive rule found in s 23(b) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) that "words in the singular number include the plural and words in the plural number include the singular" is evident.
It would, for example, have been possible to have included reference to the 2006 original assessment liability in the submission made to Mr Benson but the fact that reference to that liability was omitted does not, ipso facto , invalidate his decision.
49 Section 14S contemplates the making of a decision to issue a DPO by the Commissioner (or a delegate) who has formed a belief on reasonable grounds that it is desirable that person subject to a particular tax liability not depart Australia without wholly discharging that tax liability; or making arrangements satisfactory to the Commissioner for that tax liability to be wholly discharged.
The value judgment entailed in the decision is necessarily referable to wholly discharging or making satisfactory arrangements for wholly discharging the tax liability in respect of which the decision is made.
These same requirements necessarily attend the making of a decision by an authorised person for a delegate.
It is a usurpation of that authority for that person's unauthorised subordinate to presume to insert into what purports to be a DPO made by and on behalf of and in the name of a delegate a tax liability that is different to that in respect of which the authorised officer has made his decision on behalf of that delegate (I refer here to primary or additional tax liabilities which are fixed, not to general interest charges which necessarily accrue from day to day).
50 There is authority that the ability of a subordinate to exercise in the name of a Minister of State a statutory power conferred on the Minister need not be found in a formal instrument of authority but may permissibly be found in departmental practice: Woollett v Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries [1955] 1 QB 103, at 125 per Jenkins LJ and at 136 per Morris LJ.
In this case the delegate has executed a formal instrument of authority.
That instrument carefully delineates the extent to which particular subordinates are entitled to exercise delegated power in the name of the delegate.
It is necessarily to be inferred that the instrument evidences a considered decision by a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation as to which subordinates, having regard to the knowledge and experience required to hold particular subordinate positions, ought responsibly to be given authority to make a particular type of decision in the name of that Deputy Commissioner.
The instrument of authorisation gives a desirable certainty of authority to subordinates, as opposed to consigning such matters to informal practice and to the uncertainty of whether that practice would be regarded as acceptable having regard to the nature of the power and the level at which authority was exercised.
The deliberate exclusion in the instrument of persons of lesser seniority than Mr Benson from having authority to decide on behalf of the delegate to issue a DPO tells against such persons possessing any authority by informal practice.
51 For the Commissioner, the submission was advanced that, in a relative sense, the assessment debt and the credits which were inserted were minor.
That, with respect, is an unattractive submission.
Assuming, as the parties have, that the nature of the power to make a DPO admits of the application of the Carltona principle at all, it nonetheless remains a power that entails a serious intrusion on a person's freedom of movement.
There is therefore every reason to expect that the non-procedural aspects of the decision will be made only by the authorised officer.
Mr Benson never made a decision to make a DPO in respect of the taxation liability specified in the purported DPO of 21 May 2008.
The decision to insert a different taxation liability in that order was that of unauthorised subordinates.
52 I have no reason to doubt that, when Mr Sivasubramaniam affixed the Deputy Commissioner's signature to the DPO which issued to Mr Pattenden, he did so in good faith.
It was nonetheless not only an insubordinate act but an unauthorised one.
In so doing, he presumed that on 21 May 2008, knowing of the further taxation liability and of the credits, Mr Benson would remain of the view that the making of a DPO was appropriate.
Like comment may be made in respect of the actions of whomever it was in "Debt Management" who presumed, without authority, to insert into the draft of the DPO liabilities and credits or payments of which Mr Benson was unaware when he made the decision to make a DPO on 21 April 2008.
The addition of the additional taxation liability and of the further payments or credits was not a procedural step.
Neither, in light of that, was the affixing of the facsimile of the Deputy Commissioner's signature to a DPO in that form.
53 What Mr Benson's subordinates have done is to conflate two features of the DPO regime.
Section 14S contemplates the making of a DPO in respect of a taxation liability.
It is the amount of that liability which must be inserted into the DPO.
Once a DPO has been made:
 
(a) it remains in force until it is revoked or until it is set aside by a court: s 14S(2) of the TAA; and
 
(b) s 14T of the TAA then has effect.
54 Materially, s 14T provides:
 
 
 14T Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders
 
 (1) Where a departure prohibition order is in force in respect of a person and: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the tax liabilities to which the person is subject have been wholly discharged and the Commissioner is satisfied that it is likely that the tax liabilities to which the person may become subject in respect of, or arising out of, matters that have occurred will be: 
 
 
(i) wholly discharged; or (ii) completely irrecoverable; or (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax liabilities to which the person is subject are completely irrecoverable; 
 
 the Commissioner shall, on application being made to the Commissioner by the person to do so or on the Commissioner's own motion, revoke the departure prohibition order.

 
 Section 14T uses the plural, "taxation liabilities".
It looks both to a present totality and to the future, not just to the tax liability that occasioned the making of the DPO.
Once a DPO is made, it is s 14T that gives the order an ambulatory quality in respect of other taxation liabilities and prospective taxation liabilities.
Merely to discharge the taxation liability that prompted the making of the DPO does not entitle its recipient to the revocation of the DPO.
55 Though not expressly advanced in defence of the DPO, I have considered whether the additional entries might be severable.
Such is the intrusion that a DPO makes into personal freedom that I do not consider this to be possible.
56 The purported DPO of 21 May 2008 did not reflect the decision made by Mr Benson on behalf of the delegate.
It reflected the decision of persons not authorised to make a DPO in the name of Ms Vivian.
Even if for no other reason, it should be set aside.
Reasonable Grounds?

 
57 In the event that the conclusion just reached is in error and because an alternative ground of challenge to the DPO was fully argued it is necessary to consider whether reasonable grounds existed for the requisite belief.
58 Whether reasonable grounds existed for the holding of the requisite belief is "an objectively determined postulate", Poletti's Case, at 161.
The following passage from the joint judgment of the Full Court of the High Court in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112 definitively states the relevant law:
 When a statute prescribes that there must be "reasonable grounds" for a state of mind - including suspicion and belief - it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person.
That was the point of Lord Atkin's famous, and now orthodox, dissent in Liversidge v. Anderson [1941] UKHL 1 ; [1942] AC 206: see Nakkuda Ali v. M.F. De S. Jayaratne [1951] AC 66 , at pp 76-77; Reg.
v.
I.R.C.
; Ex parte Rossminster [1979] UKHL 5 ; [1980] AC 952 , at pp 1000, 1011, 1017-1018; Bradley v. The Commonwealth [1973] HCA 34 ; (1973) 128 CLR 557 , at pp 574-575; W.A.
Pines Pty.
Ltd. v. Bannerman (1980) 41 FLR 169, at pp 180-181; [1980] FCA 79 ; 30 ALR 559 , at pp 566-567.
That requirement opens many administrative decisions to judicial review and precludes the arbitrary exercise of many statutory powers: see, for example, Attorney-General v. Reynolds [1980] AC 637.
Therefore it must appear to the issuing justice, not merely to the person seeking the search warrant that reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion and belief exist.
59 Put in the context of an appeal under s 14V, what this means is that it is for the appellant to prove that, viewed objectively and on the material before the decision-maker or otherwise then available, reasonable grounds for the requisite belief did not exist.
