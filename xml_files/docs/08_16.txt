Since then he has accrued a substantial criminal record.
He had not become an Australian citizen when, on 7 June 2007, the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship made a decision which placed Mr Gilbert in severe jeopardy of being removed from Australia.
Mr Gilbert now challenges the lawfulness of that decision.
