One method of achieving this object is through a deed of company arrangement that provides for the partial payment of debts due to creditors in full settlement of their claims.
For the most part, the legislation does not require creditors to be treated equally or that they be given the same priority as in a winding up.
There is one exception.
By s 444DA a deed of company arrangement must contain a provision that employee creditors be given at least the same priority as in a winding up unless a majority otherwise agree, or the court permits, a departure from that rule.
The court's power to approve a deed is limited.
It can only make an order if it "is satisfied that the non-inclusion of the provision would be likely to result in the same or a better outcome for eligible employee creditors as a whole than would result from an immediate winding up of the company": s 444DA(5).
Such an order was made in relation to a deed proposed for Advance Healthcare Group Ltd (AHG).
It remains to explain why.
2 AHG operates in the pharmaceutical industry through its trading subsidiary, Pharmeasy Pty Ltd. Shares in AHG are quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), although trading in those shares has been suspended.
On 28 April 2008, Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Dixon of BDO Kendalls, were appointed joint administrators of AHG.
Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Hancock, also of BDO Kendalls, were appointed joint administrators of Pharmeasy on the same day.
The appointor was Fulcrum Equity Limited, a major shareholder and the only secured creditor of AHG.
3 The administrators conducted an investigation into the affairs of AHG and Pharmeasy.
They reached the conclusion that both were insolvent.
In particular, AHG had a shortfall of assets over liabilities that exceeded $8 million.
Its creditors were Fulcrum Equity, which was owed $3.4 million, priority creditors (employees) who were owed approximately $377,740 and unsecured creditors whose claims totalled $7,430,687.
The administrators were of the view that if AHG were wound up both employee and unsecured creditors would receive nothing.
In part this was because, in their view, a liquidator would have no claims against the directors for insolvent trading or breach of duty and neither AHG nor Pharmeasy had entered into any transaction that could be set aside as an unfair preference, unfair commercial transaction or unfair loan.
4 The administrators received from Romfal Corporate Pty Ltd, acting on behalf of a syndicate of investors, a proposal that, if implemented, would have both AHG and Pharmeasy execute a deed of company arrangement that would see creditors' claims compromised and AHG relisted.
Romfal has been involved in several reorganisations of public companies and their re-quotation on the ASX.
The administrators put the proposal to the second meeting of creditors of each company.
A report in relation to each company was produced and provided to the creditors.
