 
1 The Applicant in this proceeding is a citizen of New Zealand.
2 He first entered Australia in October 1992 and left within two weeks.
He again entered Australia in August 2000.
On the latter occasion he was granted a special category visa.
Both before and after entering Australia the Applicant committed a number of criminal offences.
His visa was cancelled by a delegate of the Minister on 5 June 2008 pursuant to s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
He appealed that decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and on 29 August 2008 the Tribunal affirmed the decision: Re Kasupene and Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] AATA 766.
3 On 23 September 2008 the Applicant filed a Notice of Appeal in this Court and an Affidavit .
The Notice of Appeal -- read together with the Affidavit -- identified the two grounds of appeal sought to be relied upon as being:
 
(i) a failure to have regard to a relevant consideration, namely the hardship that the decision would occasion to the Applicant; and
 
(ii) a failure on the part of the Tribunal to set out its findings on the question as to hardship and a failure to refer to the evidence upon which the findings were based -- as was required by s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).
4 An initial difficulty confronting the Applicant was the fact that the decision of the Tribunal is a " privative clause decision " and hence is not susceptible of appeal.
The inability to appeal arises by reason of s 476A(1)(b) and (d) of the 1958 Act which relevantly provides as follows:
 Limited jurisdiction of the Federal Court (1) Despite any other law, including section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 and section 8 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 , the Federal Court has original jurisdiction in relation to a migration decision if, and only if: ... (b) the decision is a privative clause decision, or a purported privative clause decision, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review under section 500; or ... (d) the Federal Court has jurisdiction in relation to the decision under subsection 44(3) or 45(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975.
(2) Where the Federal Court has jurisdiction in relation to a migration decision under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c), that jurisdiction is the same as the jurisdiction of the High Court under paragraph 75(v) of the Constitution .
5 Although the decision of the Tribunal was not susceptible of appeal, original jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by s 476A(1)(b) and (2) to review the Tribunal's decision.
The jurisdiction conferred is the same as that of the High Court of Australia under s 75(v) of the Constitution .
In order to obtain relief in this Court's original jurisdiction, the Applicant must demonstrate jurisdictional error: Cockrell v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 160 at [4] .
The Minister did not deny that a failure to consider a relevant consideration could amount to jurisdictional error (eg, Aporo v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] FCA 102 ; see also: Green v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] FCA 125 at [21] ---[29], [2008] FCA 125 ; 100 ALD 346) ; nor was any submission advanced that a failure to comply with s 43(2B) of the 1975 Act may not constitute jurisdictional error.
The submission which was advanced on behalf of the Minister was that the Tribunal had committed no error, be it jurisdictional or otherwise.
6 Although the constraint imposed by s 476A(1) cannot be disregarded, it did not appear that anything would have been gained had the Applicant been directed to file an application seeking judicial review as opposed to treating the Notice of Appeal as though it were such an application.
The Minister did not oppose this course.
It is not considered that such a direction would have facilitated the expeditious hearing and resolution of the proceeding.
The matter first came before the Court on 13 October 2008.
The Applicant was then in detention at Villawood Detention Centre and it was desirable to have his grievances resolved as quickly as was consistent with a proper resolution of the issues raised in his Notice of Appeal .
It is the practice of this Court to hear such cases as quickly as possible: eg, Awan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 594 at [42] , [2002] FCA 594 ; 120 FCR 1 at 11; SZLMA v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] FCA 69 at [1] .
With the co-operation of those appearing for the Respondent Minister, arrangements were made to have the relevant evidence filed and served by 15 October 2008.
The matter was listed for final hearing on 17 October 2008.
7 The Applicant appeared before the Court on 17 October 2008 and was then unrepresented.
Subsequent to that hearing, further written submissions were filed on behalf of both the Respondent Minister and the Applicant.
The most recent written submissions advanced on behalf of the Applicant were received this morning.
8 Construing the Notice of Appeal as an application for judicial review, however, only confronted the Applicant with two further difficulties, namely:
 
a) whether or not the Tribunal did in fact fail to consider the impact of the decision upon the Applicant and the hardship which would be occasioned to him if the delegate's decision was affirmed; and 
 
b) whether or not the Tribunal was, in any event, " bound " to take such a consideration into account.
A failure to take a consideration into account only gives rise to a reviewable error if the consideration was one which a decision-maker was " bound " to take into account: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39---41 per Mason J.
9 The simple fact is that the Tribunal did consider the hardship which would be occasioned to the Applicant if the decision cancelling his visa was to be affirmed and it did make findings which referred to the evidence.
The Applicant was given an opportunity for the merits of his position to be considered.
Regrettably for the Applicant, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal resolved the merits of his claims adversely to him.
10 Even if there had been a failure to consider the impact upon the Applicant of a decision affirming the cancellation of his visa, it is not considered that any jurisdictional error would in any event have been committed by the Tribunal.
TRIBUNAL'S ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE  REASONS PROVIDED: IMPACT UPON THE APPLICANT?

 
11 In challenging the delegate's decision before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Applicant was relevantly entitled to:
 
a) a reasonable opportunity to present his case; 
 
b) a determination in accordance with law as to what the Tribunal considered to be the " correct or preferable " decision on the facts then before it; and 
 
c) a statement of the reasons for the decision reached, that statement including a statement of material findings of fact and a reference to the evidence upon which those findings were made.
A determination as to whether the Tribunal has failed to take into account a relevant consideration -- in the present proceeding, hardship to the Applicant -- necessarily depends upon the evidence before the Tribunal, the submissions in fact advanced for resolution, the ambit of the discretion vested in the Tribunal, and a consideration as to whether the Tribunal has adequately set forth its findings and reasons for the conclusion in fact made.
12 No error may be exposed where (for example) the Tribunal does not resolve a submission which was never advanced; and no error may be exposed if the Tribunal's reasons -- properly construed -- adequately explain the decision made.
13 Before the Tribunal the Applicant also appeared unrepresented.
The evidence in support of his claim was his own evidence; the evidence of his father and the Applicant's younger brother and sister; and three letters of support, one from a Justice of the Peace who had known the Applicant for about five years, one from a former employer, and one from a person who had come to regard the Applicant as a trustworthy and hard worker.
The Applicant, his father, and his brother and sister all gave oral evidence before the Tribunal.
14 When appearing before the Tribunal, s 39 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act provides that the Tribunal is to " ensure that every party ... is given a reasonable opportunity to present his ... case ".
The opportunity must be a " real and meaningful opportunity " and not a " hollow shell or an empty gesture ": cf Mazhar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1759 at [31] , [2000] FCA 1759 ; 183 ALR 188 at 194---5; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 at [37] , [2003] FCAFC 126 ; 128 FCR 553 at 561.
But it is no part of the Tribunal's task to ensure that a party takes the best advantage of that opportunity ( Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services v Verney [2000] FCA 570 at [45] , [2000] FCA 570 ; 60 ALD 737 at 748).
" Neither the Act nor the common law imposes upon the tribunal the impossible task of ensuring that a party takes the best advantage of the opportunity to which he is entitled ": Sullivan v Department of Transport (1970) 20 ALR 323 at 343 per Deane J.
And it is no part of the Tribunal's task to make out an applicant's case for him: cf Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 at [187] , [2004] HCA 32 ; 197 CLR 510 at 576 per Gummow and Hayne JJ.
15 Although an unrepresented applicant is relevantly in no different position, both courts and tribunals are conscious of the difficulties confronting unrepresented litigants and are conscious of ensuring that any hearing is fair and just: Rogers v Law Coast Mortgages Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 181 at [26] per Finn J.
See also: Neil v Nott [1994] HCA 23 ; (1994) 68 ALJR 509.
Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ there observed:
 A frequent consequence of self-representation is that the court must assume the burden of endeavouring to ascertain the rights of parties which are obfuscated by their own advocacy.
See also: Nipperess v Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2006] FCA 943 at [51] ---[54], [2006] FCA 943 ; 91 ALD 362 at 372 per Cowdroy J.
16 The task to be undertaken by the Tribunal in the present proceeding -- as in other applications coming before it -- was essentially a consideration of the evidence adduced and the submissions advanced.
Its task was to resolve the case sought to be advanced by the parties in a manner consistent with determining the " correct or preferable decision ".
That task was one of determining the correct or preferable decision on the basis of the material then before the Tribunal: Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409.
Bowen CJ and Deane J there held (at 419):
 The question for the determination of the Tribunal is not whether the decision which the decision maker made was the correct or preferable one on the material before him.
The question for the determination of the Tribunal is whether that decision was the correct or preferable one on the material before the Tribunal.
These observations are oft cited with approval: eg, Esber v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 20 ; (1992) 174 CLR 430 at 440 per Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.
See also: Bushell v Repatriation Commission (1992) 175 CLR 408 at 425 per Brennan J.
17 In determining the " correct or preferable " decision, the Tribunal will ordinarily be best " guided by the parties " in identifying the issues: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1970) 20 ALR 323 at 342.
See also: A v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227 at [36] per Katz J; NADB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 200 at [21] , [2002] FCA 200 ; 189 ALR 293 at 298 per Hely J. Deane J, with whom Fisher J agreed, further observed in Sullivan however that "[c] ircumstances may ... arise in which ... a statutory tribunal, in the proper performance of its functions, will be obliged to raise issues which the parties do not wish to dispute ": (1978) 20 ALR 323 at 342.
It is " the duty of the Tribunal ", it has been said, " to satisfy itself whether a decision in respect of which an application for review is duly instituted is a decision which in its view, was objectively, the right one to be made ": Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409 at 429---30.
Before the Tribunal there is no requirement that " the point be taken ": Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334 at 348 per Fox J.
18 In determining the " correct or preferable " decision the Tribunal must also be satisfied that there is " enough material " before it on a matter of central importance to the decision to be reached ( Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334 at 343 per Bowen CJ).
And "[t] he tribunal [is] required to make the correct or preferable decision on the material before it, regardless of the form which the parties' submissions [take]": McKeown v Repatriation Commission (1995) 39 ALD 30 at 33 per Jenkinson J.
An error of law may be committed if the Tribunal ignores a central issue, even if no submission at all is directed to it: Australian Trade Commission v F  F Asia Pty Ltd (1996) 69 FCR 252 at 266 per Carr J.
See also: Transport Accident Commission v Bausch (1998) 4 VR 249 at 263 per Tadgell JA (Batt and Buchanan JJA agreeing).
19 Where one of the parties before the Tribunal is unrepresented, as in the present proceeding, the Tribunal is thus not absolved from itself considering the state of the evidence before it when determining the " correct or preferable " decision.
The fact that an unrepresented party may not have advanced evidence peculiarly within his control and of central relevance to the decision to be made, nor made a submission in respect to such material as is before the Tribunal, may make the task of the Tribunal more difficult.
In the case of an unrepresented party, the Tribunal will frequently not have the benefit of any " guidance " being provided by that party.
But the task of the Tribunal remains the same.
Not to be ignored is the obligation now imposed upon the person who made the decision to " use his or her best endeavours to assist the tribunal to make its decision in relation to the proceeding ": Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act , s 33(1AA).
The less important the available evidence or an available submission may be, the lesser may be the necessity for either the Tribunal or a respondent to address the issue.
The more important and the more centrally relevant available evidence or an available submission may be to the decision to be made, the greater may be the necessity for the issue to be addressed and resolved -- even if not otherwise addressed by an unrepresented party.
Where the line is to be drawn will obviously depend upon all of the circumstances of an individual case.
20 But it is not a line to be drawn so as to impose upon the Tribunal any general duty to itself secure evidence which has not been otherwise adduced or any general duty to pursue submissions not otherwise advanced.
The need to inquire into facts not otherwise before the Tribunal may not be confined to those facts going to jurisdiction, as in Kuswardana ; but should be confined to facts of central importance to the decision to be made: cf Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155.
And the need to consider submissions or issues not raised by the parties may equally normally be confined to those submissions which are submissions of substance which emerge from the factual material before the Tribunal: cf NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 , 144 FCR 1.
It was said there that a " judgment that the Tribunal has failed to consider a claim not expressly advanced is ... not lightly to be made.
The claim must emerge clearly from the materials before the Tribunal ": at [68].
See also: SZITR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1759 at [50] , [2006] FCA 1759 ; 44 AAR 382 at 397 per Moore J; MZXMG v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2007] FCA 1884 at [13] ---[14] per Middleton J.
In MZXLB v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2007] FCA 1588 at [14] Finkelstein J referred to NABE and observed that there " is no precise standard for determining when an issue is 'raised squarely', but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it ".
21 As a practical matter, a Court may be more willing to draw the line in favour of an unrepresented party than a party represented by counsel.
Or, expressed differently, the issue may be more likely to arise in those cases where one party is not represented.
22 In performing its statutory functions, the Tribunal in the present proceeding also had to apply a direction given by a former Minister under s 499(1) of the Migration Act on 23 August 2001, namely a direction titled " Direction --- Visa Refusal and Cancellation under Section 501 --- No 21 ".
Section 499(2A) provides that the Tribunal " must comply with a direction under subsection (1) ".
23 In Sales v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1807 this Direction was described as " a comprehensive and careful document ".
Allsop J there observed:
 [14] The direction is a comprehensive and careful document of 11 pages.
It makes clear in the preamble that the exercise of the discretion whether or not to cancel the visas will take into account a wide range of factors including the protection and the expectations of the Australian community, the nature of the crimes committed, the non-citizen's links to Australia and any relevant international law obligations of Australia.
The preamble went on to say that the purpose of refusing or cancelling a visa under s 501 is to protect the safety and welfare of the Australian community and to exercise a choice on behalf of the Australian community as a whole as to who should be allowed to enter or remain in the community.
The task to prepare material for a consideration of such matters, objectively understood, is wide-reaching and significant.
Given the terms of s 499(2A) , it was Direction No 21 which properly provided the structure for the Tribunal's reasons and its consideration of the evidence.
24 Relevantly, Direction No 21 provides as follows:
 2.1 If a non-citizen does not pass the Character Test, decision-makers must have regard to the following considerations when exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the non-citizen should be permitted to enter or remain in Australia.
... 2.3 In making a decision whether to refuse or cancel a visa, there are three primary considerations: (a) the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community; (b) the expectations of the Australian community; and (c) in all cases involving a parental or other close relationship between a child or children and the person under consideration, the best interests of the child or children.
... 2.5 The factors relevant to an assessment of the level of risk to the community of the entry or continued stay of a non-citizen include: ... (c) whether visa refusal or cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct (general deterrence).
