 
1 The applicant seeks leave to file an amended substituted statement of claim in support of his application.
Various grounds have been raised in opposition by a number of the respondents.
Most have been resolved.
Ultimately the grounds of opposition that remain are quite limited.
They are advanced only by the fifth, sixth and seventh respondents.
2 In addition to opposing the proposed amended statement of claim, the fifth, sixth and seventh respondents seek summary judgment under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCA).
3 Relevantly the claim by the applicant as trustee of the bankrupt's estate is that the first respondent (Mr Spencer) held certain property (the property) on trust for the bankrupt and that the beneficial ownership in the property has consequently vested in the applicant as trustee.
(There are alternative claims but that is the only claim which is presently under attack).
4 These respondents have been joined as they claim to hold an interest in the property by way of a fixed charge.
The applicant contends that the charge is void as being a transfer of the property at an undervalue under s 120(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (BA).
STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
 
5 Section 120 and s 121 BA relevantly provide as follows:
 120 Undervalued transactions Transfers that are void against trustee 
 
 (1) A transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt (the transferor ) to another person (the transferee ) is void against the trustee in the transferor's bankruptcy if: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the transfer took place in the period beginning 5 years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and ending on the date of the bankruptcy; and
 (b) the transferee gave no consideration for the transfer or gave consideration of less value than the market value of the property.

 
 
... 
 
 Meaning of transfer of property and market value 
 
 (7) For the purposes of this section: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) transfer of property includes a payment of money; and
 (b) a person who does something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist is taken to have transferred the property to the other person; and
 (c) the market value of property transferred is its market value at the time of the transfer.

 
 
 121 Transfers to defeat creditors 
 
 ... 
 Meaning of transfer of property and market value 
 
 (9) For the purposes of this section:
 (a) transfer of property includes a payment of money; and 
 
 
 
 
 (b) a person who does something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist is taken to have transferred the property to the other person; and
 (c) the market value of property transferred is its market value at the time of the transfer.

 
 

6 Section 120(1) provides in substance that a transfer of property by a person who later becomes bankrupt to another a person is void against the trustee in bankruptcy if it took place within 5 years of the bankruptcy (as this transfer did) and if there was insufficient consideration or no consideration.
The expression 'transfer of property' is given an extended meaning by s 120(7)(b) BA.
Accordingly a person 'who does something that results in another person becoming the owner of the property that did not previously exist is taken to have transferred the property to the other person'.
