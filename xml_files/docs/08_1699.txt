 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Each applicant 'appeals' under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act) from decisions of a Senior Member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) given on 30 April 2007.
The Tribunal affirmed the decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) to disallow the applicants' objections to the amended assessments of income tax that were issued to them.
These reasons deal with the 'appeals' on a joint basis.
Relevantly, each applicant is in the same position.
2 Each of the applicants was an investor in the Base Metals Exploration and Prospecting Project (the Project).
The applicants claimed an entitlement to an allowable deduction in relation to management fees and interest on a loan entered into for the purpose of financing the applicants' payment of the management fees.
