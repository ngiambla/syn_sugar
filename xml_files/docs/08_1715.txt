 BACKGROUND 
 
1 The plaintiff, K  L Airconditioning Pty Ltd (K  L) is in the business of repairing, maintaining and installing airconditioning.
It has been working on projects at Port Hedland, in High Street, Fremantle and at Kwinana High School.
K  L's sole Director is Mr Stephen Koch.
The company also employs Mr Peter Langley as a Manager.
Indirectly, through another company, Mr Langley owns 50% of the shares with Mr Koch in K  L.
 
2 The defendant, Circuit Force (WA) Pty Ltd (Circuit Force) is an electrical service business which is operated by Mr Cyril Branson.
Mr Branson engages other electricians to perform works on behalf of Circuit Force from time to time.
3 K  L contracted Circuit Force to perform work for it at the three project sites referred to above.
Circuit Force has been providing services to K  L since 2005.
K  L was apparently slow in paying Circuit Force for the work that it had performed and in April 2008, Mr Branson decided to take more positive steps to recover the debt due to Circuit Force.
4 A series of emails shows that Mr Branson informed Mr Langley on 17 April 2008 that the sum owed at that stage was $92,039.61.
On 5 May 2008, Mrs Denise Koch, wife of Mr Koch told Mr Branson that four payments covering the debt would be made on four dates in May and June 2008.
No question was raised as to the debts being due and owing.
