 
1 The appellant appeals to this Court from a decision of Jarret FM dated 5 June 2008 ( BRGAG OF 2008 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 722).
In that case his Honour dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 29 January 2008.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister dated 16 October 2008 wherein the delegate refused the grant of a protection (class XA) visa to the appellant pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).
BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of the Republic of Indonesia.
He arrived in Australia on 26 August 2007 and applied for a protection (class XA) visa on 20 September 2007.
The appellant claims that he is at risk of being persecuted by the Indonesian authorities.
3 The appellant claims that prior to 1998 he had a very close relationship with the Soeharto government.
He claims that after 1998 he fell out of favour with the new Indonesian government because of that relationship.
4 The appellant claims that in 2001 the Indonesian government sent police to the appellant's workplace and questioned him.
Despite finding no evidence of wrong doing, the appellant claims that the police believed the appellant had a plot to overthrow the new government and imprisoned him for six months.
DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 
 
5 Following the decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the grant of a protection (class XA) visa to the appellant, on 16 November 2007 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
