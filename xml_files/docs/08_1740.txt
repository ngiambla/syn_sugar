 
1 The appellant appeals to this Court from a decision of Jarret FM dated 26 May 2008 ( BRGAD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 734).
In that case his Honour dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 31 January 2008.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent dated 19 October 2008 wherein the delegate refused the grant of a protection (class XA) visa to the appellant pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).
BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of the Republic of Indonesia.
He arrived in Australia on 26 August 2007 on a Subclass 456 Temp Business Visa and applied for a protection (class XA) visa on 20 September 2007.
The appellant claimed to have suffered persecution from the current Indonesian government on the basis that he expressed a preference for the former Indonesian leader, Mr Soeharto.
3 The appellant claims he was imprisoned in Indonesia for a one month period because he had been critical of the new Indonesian government and expressed a preference for Mr Soeharto.
The appellant asserts that following his graduation from University, the police visited him frequently.
On one occasion the police came to his house and asked him what he thought of the Indonesian government.
When he answered that he hated the new government, he was beaten, arrested and imprisoned for one month.
4 The appellant also claims that the new Indonesian government has made life for his family hard because his mother was a member of the Soeharto government while his father has been accused of being a "Soeharto person".
DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 
 
5 On 29 November 2007, the Tribunal wrote to the applicant advising that it had considered all the material before it relating to his application but that it was unable to make a favourable decision on the basis of that information alone.
The Tribunal invited the appellant to attend a hearing on 10 January 2008 to present arguments and give oral evidence.
The appellant was also advised that non-attendance at the hearing could lead to a decision being entered without further notice.
The Tribunal did not receive a response from the appellant and he was not present at the Tribunal hearing.
6 The Tribunal found that the appellant had made a number of claims that had not been substantiated.
