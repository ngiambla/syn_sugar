 
1 The applicant, Mr Lim, appeals from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal').
In the Tribunal, Mr Lim sought a review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal which affirmed a prior determination to impose an eight-week non-payment period on Mr Lim's "Newstart Allowance".
A Newstart Allowance is made to job seekers, such as Mr Lim, who are unemployed and are looking for work.
2 The issue before the Tribunal was whether Mr Lim had a reasonable excuse for his failure to comply with his "Newstart Activity Agreements".
A Newstart Activity Agreement entered into by a job seeker is an agreement with which he or she must comply in order to continue to qualify for the Newstart Allowance.
If the job seeker fails to comply with the Newstart Activity Agreement, the job seeker commits a "newstart participation failure" and a Newstart Allowance is not payable.
Failure to comply with a Newstart Activity Agreement is not regarded as a newstart participation failure if the job seeker can show that he or she has a reasonable excuse for non-compliance.
3 Mr Lim executed three Newstart Activity Agreements ('the Lim Activity Agreements') on 20 December 2006, 26 February 2007 and 7 March 2007.
The other party to each of the agreements was denoted as WorkDirections Pty Ltd ('WorkDirections'), described on the Lim Activity Agreements as a "Job Network Member".
The Lim Activity Agreements also contain a number of references to Centrelink.
For example, the agreements state that they show the activities that Mr Lim must perform in order to receive income support payments from Centrelink and that Mr Lim must contact Centrelink when he ceases an activity or his circumstances change.
Centrelink is not, however, a party to the Lim Activity Agreements.
4 The hearing before the Tribunal concerned three breaches of the Lim Activity Agreements ('the participation breaches').
The participation breaches were committed under s 624(1)(d) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) ('the Act').
As Mr Lim had committed three such participation failures within a 12 month period, his payment was suspended pursuant to s 629(1)(a) of the Act.
5 The Tribunal found, and Mr Lim does not challenge, that the three alleged breaches had occurred and that no reasonable excuse had been offered for those breaches.
Accordingly, the decision under review was affirmed.
It is not necessary to examine further the nature of the participation breaches or the excuses offered for them, as those findings are not challenged on appeal.
6 Mr Lim has challenged the validity of the Lim Activity Agreements.
The validity of the Lim Activity Agreements was not raised before the Tribunal.
Mr Lim conducted his application in the Tribunal on the basis that he was subject to valid Newstart Activity Agreements but that he had excuses for not complying with the terms of the agreements.
THE NOTICE OF APPEAL 
 
7 In the appeal as originally filed, the only relevant questions of law raised were:
 Mr Lim has already made arrangements with Rebecca Dean and also business manager to reschedule job search of 27th April to following week.
Application of law on "attendance" and "reasonable excuse" on 27th April is irrelevant.
8 The respondent challenged the competency of the appeal on the ground that it did not disclose a question of law as required by s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act').
That objection to competency came before Branson J who accepted that the notice of appeal did not identify a question of law capable of constituting the subject matter of the purported appeal ( Lim v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 1058).
Her Honour concluded at [12] that the:
 ... factual assertion that Mr Lim had made arrangements, apparently after breaching one of his agreements, to attend at WorkDirections on an extra day in a later week does not itself constitute a question of law.
Nor does it by implication raise a question of law the answer to which could throw doubt on the correctness of the decision of the Tribunal.
The references in the notice of appeal to the law of "attendance" and "reasonable excuse" do not assist Mr Lim in this regard.
9 However, her Honour gave consideration to any questions of law that Mr Lim could reasonably expect to be able to obtain leave to include in his notice of appeal were he to apply to amend the document.
Her Honour said at [15]:
 However, it seems to me that it is at least arguable that none of the agreements between Mr Lim and WorkDirections is "a Newstart Activity Agreement between the Secretary and the person" within the meaning of s 624 of [the Act].
In particular I consider it arguable that the Secretary has not approved a form of Newstart Activity Agreement for an agreement between a person and a party other than Centrelink.
It may also be arguable that the authority of the Secretary to delegate all or any of the Secretary's powers under [the Act] is insufficient to alter the requirements of s 605(4) that a Newstart Activity Agreement be between the person and the Secretary.
I do not mean thereby to suggest that the Secretary could not delegate his or her power to sign such an agreement.
However, the agreements entered into by Mr Lim do not purport to be agreements between him and the Secretary.
They purport to be agreements between him and WorkDirections.
10 Mr Lim filed an amended notice of appeal on 25 July 2008 and a further amended notice of appeal on 20 August 2008.
In the further amended notice of appeal the questions of law raised are:
 
 1.
Whether it was open to the Tribunal to be satisfied that the agreements entered into by Mr Lim were Newstart Activity agreements within the meaning of s 624 of [the Act] .

 
 2.
Whether it was open to the Tribunal to proceed hearing when the respondent (Secretary, DEWR) was not the same person who purported to have activity agreement with Mr Lim within the meaning of s 624 of [the Act] .

 
11 The ground stated in the further amended notice of appeal is ' covering up the truth and deceiving the court process '.
I do not propose to deal with this ground further.
Nothing was raised that would support any such conclusion.
12 The findings of fact that Mr Lim asks the Court to make are:
 
 
 1.
Agreements which Mr Lim signed are not approved by the Secretary s 234 instrument.
Agreements which Mr Lim signed are purported to be agreement between Mr Lim and Workdirections.

 
 2.
The newstart agreement was purported between Mr Lim and the Secretary of liberal govt.
At the AAT hearing, the solicitor of respondent represent Miss Lisa Paul, Secretary of labour govt.
Miss Paul was not privity to the newstart agreement with Mr Lim.

 
 

13 The first proposed finding of fact relates to the two questions of law identified in the further amended notice of appeal.
The second proposed finding raises a different issue.
This issue does not relate to either of the questions of law identified in the further amended notice of appeal.
The respondent points out that the issue is not reflected in the questions of law and no leave was granted to raise this fresh issue when leave was granted on 13 August 2008 to amend the orders sought.
The respondent does, however, provide submissions addressing this question.
14 The hearing of the appeal took place on 8 October 2008.
Following the hearing, I gave the parties the opportunity to file further evidence and written submissions and also to make oral submissions addressing, primarily, the delegations made by the Secretary and the identity of WorkDirections as described on the Lim Activity Agreements.
RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS AND DELEGATIONS 
 The legislation 
 
15 The Act relevantly provides:
 Section 629: 
 
 (1) A newstart allowance is not payable to a person, for the period of 8 weeks ... if the person: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) commits a newstart participation failure (the repeated failure ), having committed newstart participation failures (the earlier failures ) on 2 or more other occasions during the period of 12 months preceding that failure; ... 
 
 
 Section 624: (1) A person commits a newstart participation failure if the person: ... 
 
 
 (d) fails to comply with a term of a Newstart Activity Agreement between the Secretary and the person; ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Despite subsection (1), a failure of a kind referred to in that subsection is not a newstart participation failure if the person satisfies the Secretary that the person had a reasonable excuse for the failure.

 
 Section 605(4): A Newstart Activity Agreement is a written agreement in a form approved by the Secretary.
The agreement is between the person and the Secretary.
[original emphasis] 
16 Section 234(1) of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 (Cth) ('the SS Administration Act') authorises the Secretary to delegate all or any of the Secretary's powers under the Act to "an officer", including a person engaged by an organisation that performs services for the Commonwealth (s 234(7)(c) of the SS Administration Act).
The delegations 
 
17 By an instrument to take effect on 1 July 2006 ('the first instrument'), the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ('DEWR') (as the Department then was) delegated ' to each person engaged by an Employment Services Provider to perform functions or to provide services under a relevant arrangement ' his powers under, relevantly, s 605 of the Act, subject to limitations which are not presently relevant.
By another instrument, commencing on the same date, the Secretary approved the form of Activity Agreement under, relevantly, s 605(4) of the Act as an approved form of Activity Agreement for a job seeker to enter into with an Employment Services Provider or with Centrelink ('the Approved Activity Agreement').
