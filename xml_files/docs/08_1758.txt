FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
1 When a person moves into a dwelling, he or she will frequently want a telephone service directly connected to the public switched telephone network ("PSTN") through what is commonly called a "landline".
Most residential premises in Australia have a wall socket allowing for a telephone to be plugged into the socket and thus connected to the PSTN.
Many forms of residential development have more than one dwelling, such as apartment or home unit buildings, and town houses.
Telephony providers refer to these as "multi-dwelling units" or "MDUs".
Because a number of the terms necessary to resolve these proceedings are acronyms, I will include a glossary as a schedule to this judgment for ease of reference.
2 Many MDUs have a main distribution frame ("MDF").
The MDF is used to connect the telephony wires of dwellings within the MDU to appropriate wires that, in turn, connect to a telephone exchange.
A form of connection is by use of a copper or aluminium wire, which, as explained below, is defined as a "communications wire".
One, but by no means the exclusive, means of connection between the exchange side of the MDF and the exchange itself is through an unconditioned communications wire.
This form of communication is called an unconditioned local loop service ("ULLS").
Telstra Corporation Limited owns and maintains those local loops.
It also owns over 5,000 local exchanges as explained in Telstra Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth [2008] HCA 7 ; (2008) 243 ALR 1 at 3-4 [1] - [8] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ.
3 The essential and defining characteristics of the ULLS are that it consists of an unconditioned communications wire (usually a twisted pair of copper or aluminium wires) between, in substance, the exchange side of the MDF and the telephone exchange itself.
However, there are other means of connecting between the exchange side of the MDF and the telephone exchange, including using fibre optic cable.
Thus, the mere fact that there may be wires physically present at the exchange side of the MDU does not mean that the whole path to the exchange from that wire will always be physically along a copper or aluminium communications wire or wires.
4 Other telecommunications providers than Telstra are able to offer telephony services to, among others, residents of MDUs.
In September 2006, Optus Networks Pty Limited was such a provider.
At that time, Optus notified a dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission concerning access to the ULLS provided by Telstra in MDUs under s 152CM(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
Part XIC of the Act regulates, among other things, access to parts of the PSTN, and requires the Commission to act as an arbitrator of disputes between participants in the telecommunications industry concerning access to services.
5 The Commission conducted an arbitration of the access dispute to the ULLS between Optus and Telstra.
Optus claimed that unnecessary costs were incurred by both Optus directly and through the charges it had to pay Telstra.
This was because technicians from each of them had to attend at an MDF to connect the wires from the exchange side to the wires on the dwelling side of the frame in order to provide the subscriber with a link to the telephone exchange.
Optus contended that often no attendances were necessary.
The parties used the description "truck roll" to describe the visit by a technician in a vehicle to make the physical inspection of the wires.
Telstra's technician would identify a pair of wires on the exchange side of the MDF as being connected to the ULLS and available for use by Optus' subscriber.
Optus would then send a technician to connect the two wires identified by Telstra to wires on the dwelling side of the MDF linked to Optus' subscriber's dwelling.
This occurred even where the previous occupant of the dwelling had had a telephone line connected.
6 Optus contended that it was unnecessary in those circumstances for either Telstra or Optus technicians to attend at the MDF, since a physical link had already existed for the previous subscriber who had lived in the dwelling.
Thus Optus argued that an unnecessary expense was incurred in having two technicians redo or check something that already existed.
Optus suggested that there must be a simpler and more efficient means of giving access.
7 When the Commission conducted the arbitration it raised a suggestion that if there were a "soft dial tone" on the telephone in the subscriber's dwelling, that would indicate that there was already a continuous link to an exchange.
A soft dial tone indicates that the line from the subscriber's dwelling has a physical connection to an exchange but that line is not then being used to provide any services to a subscriber.
The line can be used only to make emergency calls and calls to a number provided by Telstra in order to indicate the previous telephone number used on the PSTN to reach that address.
The Commission suggested that ascertaining the presence of a soft dial tone would indicate the existence of an ULLS and thus make attendances by technicians at the MDF unnecessary.
8 The fallacy in this suggestion is, of course, that the existence of the soft dial tone does not indicate whether the connection is by way only of an unconditioned communications wire (i.e.
an ULLS), or, by way in whole or part of some other means, e.g.
fibre optic cable or other connection not being an ULLS.
Moreover, while the soft dial tone indicates the existence of a connection it also is present only when no actual service is being provided over that connection (i.e.
the connection is not in use and is vacant).
In its final determination following the arbitration, the Commission proposed a novel regime using the presence of a soft dial tone for the ordering of ULLS by Optus from Telstra.
This regime was intended to adapt existing processes in the Australian Communications Industry Forum ("ACIF") industry code C569:2005 Unconditioned Local Loop Service --- Ordering, Provisioning and Customer Transfer (Code 569).
I will explain what this involved later (see Ch 6).
However, Code 569 did not use the term "soft dial tone" at all.
9 The operative provision in the regime proposed by the Commission in its final determination was par 10 which provided as follows:
 
 
 "10.
Except where the parties agree otherwise, the supply by Telstra to Optus in respect of the ULLS in MDUs serviced by a MDF in the building is to be as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Where there is an existing Communications Wire between the Telstra exchange and the end-user customer's premises which has a soft dial tone and Optus submits a ULLS Request to Telstra that provides the Service Number (which includes the full national number) and address associated with the Communications Wire, Telstra must treat the request as if it was a ULLS Transfer Request following the ULLS Transfer process specified in the ACIF C569:2005 Unconditioned Local Loop Service --- Ordering, Provisioning and Customer Transfer industry code.
(b) On receipt of a ULLS Request from Optus, Telstra must validate that the Service Number corresponds to the address specified in the request, based on Telstra's cabling records in Telstra exchanges.
(c) If this information is incorrect, Telstra must follow the ULLS Rejection process for ULLS Transfers specified in the ACIF C569:2005 Unconditioned Local Loop Service --- Ordering, Provisioning and Customer Transfer industry code.
(d) For the purposes of the ULLS Transfer Request and in accordance with the definition of Losing Access Seeker stated in the ACIF C569:2005 Unconditioned Local Loop Service --- Ordering, Provisioning and Customer Transfer industry code, where Telstra has been supplying the service immediately prior to the transfer, Telstra is to be considered the Losing Access Seeker.
(e) Where there is no Communications Wire between the Telstra exchange and the end-user customer's premises i.e., there is no soft dial tone and Optus submits a Vacant ULLS Request, Telstra must follow the Vacant ULLS process specified in the ACIF C569:2005 Unconditioned Local Loop Service --- Ordering, Provisioning and Customer Transfer industry code.
(f) If Optus submits a ULLS Transfer Request to Telstra that meets the requirements in paragraph (a), Optus must accept any risk to the quality of, connectivity of and suitability for providing voice and/or data services on the existing copper path between the Telstra exchange and the end-user premises.
(g) For the avoidance of doubt, where there is an existing Communications Wire between the Telstra exchange and the end-user customer's premises which has a soft dial tone but Optus is not prepared to accept any risk to the quality of, connectivity of and suitability for providing voice and/or data services on the existing copper path between the Telstra exchange and the end-user premises, Optus must submit a Vacant ULLS Request.
" (bold emphasis added)
 
 
 

10 Under s 152CR(1)(d) of the Act, the Commission was required to take into account the direct costs to Telstra of providing a declared service, here the ULLS, in making a final determination.
During the course of the arbitration Telstra contended that it would cost Telstra about $1.7 million to redesign its computer system to accommodate the proposal that the Commission had in mind.
Optus argued that it would only cost it, Optus, about $360,000 to implement the proposals.
