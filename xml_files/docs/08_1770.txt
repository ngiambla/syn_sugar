 APPLICATION BROUGHT EX PARTE TO SERVE OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION THE THIRD DEFENDANT TO THE SECOND CROSS-CLAIM 
 
 1 On 13 November 2008, I made orders permitting service of the second cross-claimants', (being Suzlon Energy Limited and its four associated companies) second cross- application on the third second cross-defendant, Sanjeev Bangad in India.
I was satisfied that leave should be granted under O 8 r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules and that it was appropriate to do so on the conditions I set out.
The matter was of some urgency because the other parties to the proceedings have been working towards a final hearing commencing on 2 February 2009.
These are my reasons for those orders.
THE PROCEDURAL CONTEXT 
 
2 Suzlon Energy Limited and its four associated companies are the cross-claimants on the second cross-claim in these proceedings.
That cross-claim essentially involves allegations against Mr Bangad who was, at relevant times earlier this year, an officer of one or more of the Suzlon companies.
Mr Bangad's address is in Pune, India.
The Suzlon companies sought leave to serve him in India pursuant to O 8 r 2.
3 The Suzlon companies allege that Mr Bangad acted in breach of his fiduciary duty owed to one or more of them not to act in his own interests when he purported to assert that he had authority to enter into contractual arrangements binding the Suzlon companies to the central contractual documents in issue in these proceedings.
