 
1 The applicant has for many years carried on business as a retailer of menswear at stores in the Melbourne CBD and elsewhere in Victoria trading under the name "Peter Jackson".
It will be convenient to refer to it by that name.
2 The first respondent Mens Suit Warehouse Direct Pty Ltd (MSWD) has since 2002 operated menswear stores in or near the Melbourne CBD, and in particular at 500 Collins Street (North side between William and King Streets), in Queen Street on the corner of Little Collins Street in the old RACV building and at 177 Toorak Road, South Yarra.
These stores trade under the name "Walter Withers".
MSWD has other stores, including one at 431A Victoria Street, Abbotsford and one at the corner of Lonsdale and Queen Streets in the CBD, where it trades under the name "Mens Suit Warehouse Direct".
3 Peter Jackson complains of a number of alleged representations made by MSWD which are said to be misleading and deceptive in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
Sections 53(a) , (c), (d), (e) and (eb) of the Trade Practices Act and a number of provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1999 (Vic) are mentioned in the further amended statement of claim (FASC) but were not the subject of consideration at the hearing.
Peter Jackson claims to have suffered loss and damage and seeks damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.
THE CBD REPRESENTATIONS 
 
4 In television advertising MSWD, in respect of its Walter Withers stores, made a statement which, although varied from time to time, was substantially in these terms:
 For the business executive wanting to look the part without the hefty price tag, Walter Withers Suits for Men is the place to be.
Stand out from the crowd with the latest European fabrics and styles.
You'll look a million dollars at an affordable price when dressed by Walter Withers.
For a limited time, receive a second suit free with your first suit purchase.
Walter Withers Suits for Men.
177 Toorak Road, South Yarra and 500 Collins Street, City.
Open 7 days.
5 Similar statements are alleged to have been made on signage at the Walter Withers CBD stores and on labels on suits sold at those stores.
It is not necessary to consider such statements separately.
The statements are said to have conveyed the following representations.
The Second Suit Free representation 
 
6 The suits in question have a marked price of $799 or $899.
The statements are said to be misleading and deceptive because, according to FASC par 5(c), they convey the representation that suits sold at the Walter Withers stores "are each of a quality and style being made of European fabric and in a European style to warrant a retail of price (sic) $799 or $899".
7 According to FASC par 6(d), this representation is false and misleading because "the price of $799 or $899 for which the suits are sold does not represent a price bearing out the true retail value of suits sold by (MSWD)".
The European Fabrics representation 
 
8 The statements are said to convey a false representation by MSWD that its suits sold at the Walter Withers stores are made from European fabrics (FASC par 5(a)).
The Exclusivity representation 
 
9 The statements are said to convey a false representation that MSWD's suits are made exclusively for its Walter Withers stores (FASC par 5(b)).
The Limited Time representation 
 
10 The statements are said to convey a false representation that that the Second Suit Free offer is available for a limited time only whereas the offer has run continuously except for a six week period in February-March 2008 and a four week period in July 2008, when a 50 per cent off sale was promoted (FASC pars 5(e), 6(e)).
THE ABBOTSFORD REPRESENTATIONS 
 
11 Separate representations are relied on in relation to the Abbotsford store.
These are said to arise from signage at the store.
The store has a substantial frontage to Victoria Street, a busy arterial road.
