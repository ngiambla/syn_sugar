 
1 The first appellant (Ms Klewer) was declared bankrupt on 20 September 2005.
The second appellant (Robert Klewer or Robert) is Ms Klewer's son.
At the time the sequestration order was made, Ms Klewer resided in and was the registered proprietor of 30 Coachmans Close, Korora, New South Wales ('the Korora property').
The respondent, the Official Trustee, is the trustee of Ms Klewer's estate and currently the registered proprietor of the Korora property by virtue of the operation of s 58(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act').
Both appellants presently reside in the Korora property, with Ms Klewer continuing to make mortgage repayments to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
2 The appellants appeal from a decision of Raphael FM dismissing their application for a declaration that the Korora property is non-divisible among Ms Klewer's creditors ( Klewer v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2008] FMCA 274).
Ms Klewer argued before Raphael FM that the Korora property is not divisible amongst her creditors for two reasons: that the moneys used to purchase the property constituted "protected money" within the meaning of s 116(2D) of the Act and that the Korora property was held in trust by Ms Klewer for Robert Klewer and was therefore not property divisible amongst Ms Klewer's creditors by virtue of the operation of s 116(2)(a) of the Act.
