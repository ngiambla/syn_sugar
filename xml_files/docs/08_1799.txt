 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 22 , 23, 24, 28 and 29 August 2006, a group of employees of the respondent, Heinemann Electric Pty Ltd ('Heinemann'), engaged in a ban on working overtime.
On each of those days they worked their ordinary working hours.
Nevertheless, Heinemann withheld all the employees' pay referrable to those days on the basis that the operation of s 507 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') was to prohibit the making of a payment to an employee in relation to a period of industrial action.
The main issue in this proceeding is whether Heinemann was in fact prohibited from making any payments to the employees engaged in a ban on overtime referrable to those days.
Further Amended Application 
 
2 By Further Amended Application the applicant made a number of claims.
It claimed that Heinemann had breached cl 7 of the Heinemann Electric Pty Ltd Enterprise Agreement 2003 ('the Agreement') by failing to pay certain specified employees for ordinary hours worked.
It was contended that Heinemann failed to pay those employees at all, or failed to pay the wages as and when the wages fell due.
3 The applicant sought an order imposing penalties pursuant to s 719(1) of the Act and for the payment of wages owed to each of the unpaid employees pursuant to s 719(6).
The applicant also sought interest on the owing unpaid wages pursuant to s 722 of the Act.
