 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 C Incorporated ('C Inc') is a large Aboriginal community controlled not for profit organisation situated in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.
It provides primary health care services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in Alice Springs and the surrounding areas.
It has been given the pseudonym 'C Inc' to assist in protecting the privacy of those of its patients who may be affected by these proceedings.
2 On 20 May 2008, the Australian Crime Commission ('ACC') served an amended Notice on C Inc under s 29(1) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) ('the ACC Act') requiring it to produce certain medical records and others documents held by it ('the medical records').
In summary, the medical records related to the presentations by both child and adult patients of C Inc for treatment that may have been associated with sexually transmitted illnesses ('STIs'), pregnancies and contraception, sexual and/or physical abuse.
The sensitivity associated with the very personal nature of this information is obvious.
The ACC claimed that it required the medical records as a part of its Special Intelligence Operation into Indigenous violence or child abuse in the Northern Territory.
3 C Inc originally commenced these proceedings on 9 May 2008 to challenge the original notice that was served by the ACC on 1 April 2008.
When the amended Notice was served, C Inc applied to amend its application in these proceedings to challenge that amended Notice ('the Notice').
C Inc's challenge to the Notice is based upon a large number of grounds but essentially it claims that it was not reasonable in all the circumstances for Mr Anderson, the ACC Examiner, to issue the Notice.
Ultimately the best interests of the child patients affected by the Notice has become the central issue.
4 Some days before C Inc commenced these proceedings, another Aboriginal controlled health organisation in the Northern Territory also commenced proceedings in this Court challenging a similar notice issued by the ACC.
That applicant was given the pseudonym NTD8 .
5 Initially it was thought that these two sets of proceedings could proceed to hearing at the same time.
However, it later became apparent that despite the close similarity between the two sets of proceedings, somewhat different factual and legal issues arose for consideration in each matter.
As a result, I heard NTD8 's application about two weeks before I heard this application.
I have already delivered my decision in NTD8 : see NTD8 v Australian Crime Commission (No 2) [2008] FCA 1551 (' NTD8 ').
6 I mention the NTD8 decision because some of the general factual background and all of the section describing the relevant provisions of the ACC Act set out in that decision, apply equally to this decision.
Nonetheless, so that these two decisions can each stand alone, I propose to repeat that material in this decision.
I will also add the relevant factual background that is unique to these proceedings and identify the issues that arise.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
7 In June 2007, following the publication of the 'Little Children are Sacred' Report which was commissioned by the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government decided to establish the Northern Territory Emergency Response, more commonly known as the Northern Territory Intervention, to deal with the incidence of child abuse and domestic violence in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.
8 As a part of the Northern Territory Intervention, a package of four pieces of legislation was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament.
It included the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory Emergency Response and Other Measures) Act 2007 ('the FACSIA Act') and the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007, both of which made a number of amendments to the ACC Act.
In general terms those amendments extended the ambit of the ACC's functions to include intelligence operations in relation to Indigenous violence or child abuse.
I have set out a summary of those amendments in the Relevant Legislative Provisions section below.
9 In pursuit of its extended functions, on 5 February 2008, the Board of the ACC issued a Determination ('the Determination') entitled the Special Intelligence Operation Authorisation and Determination (Indigenous Violence or Child Abuse) 2008 ('the Special Intelligence Operation').
The purpose of the Special Intelligence Operation included the collection and analysis of criminal information and intelligence relating to federally relevant criminal activities in relation to Indigenous violence or child abuse or other federally relevant criminal activity.
Its objectives included:
 (a) Identifying offenders involved in Indigenous violence and child abuse; (b) Supporting investigations by partner agencies into violence or child abuse in Indigenous communities by utilising ACC coercive powers where appropriate; (c) Enhancing the understanding of the nature and extent of violence or child abuse in Indigenous communities; (d) Providing intelligence based advice to the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory organisations on violence or child abuse in remote and urban Indigenous communities, including organised crime involvement in substance abuse, alcohol and pornography; and (e) Facilitating intelligence collection and sharing.
10 Mr Jeffrey Philip Anderson is an Examiner appointed under s 46B(1) of the ACC Act.
On 1 April 2008, in his role as an ACC Examiner and as a part of the Special Intelligence Operation, he issued the original notice to C Inc under s 29(1) of the ACC Act.
11 In response, on 9 May 2008, C Inc issued these proceedings under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) seeking to challenge Mr Anderson's decision to issue that original notice.
That application was supported by affidavits by Ms Nardine Rosemary Collier, the solicitor for C Inc, and by Ms Stephanie Bell, the director of C Inc.
In addition to these affidavits, C Inc relied upon two further affidavits at the hearing of this matter: one by Dr John Dominic Boffa and the other by Mr Henry Mizow.
12 On 20 May 2008, Mr Anderson issued the Notice.
The schedule of documents to be produced under the Notice is contained in an annexure to the Notice, in the following terms:
 
 Copies of documents, electronic or paper copy, including but not limited to case notes, entries and records for all presentations of persons to the C Inc, at its medical clinic situated at ** Alice Springs for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2007 in relation to:
 

 
 
 1.
Indigenous Patients, under 16 years of age presenting due to, or with, sexually transmitted illnesses, pregnancies or seeking services relating to contraception and terminations of pregnancies.

 


 
 
 Documents relating to (1) above should be inclusive of any personal particulars available including the name, date and place of birth, address and date of persons presenting for treatment or consultation together with the name of the person to whom any such Indigenous patient reported on each occasion (if more than one) in the relevant period.

 3.

In addition, the documents should identify the person to whom any such Indigenous person presented on any occasion (if more than one) in the relevant period.
The * indicates information that has been deleted to protect patient privacy.

 

13 In both the original notice and the Notice, Mr Anderson decided to include a notation under s 29A(1) of the ACC Act.
In the Notice, the notation was to the following effect:
 
Pursuant to subsection 29A(1) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 , disclosure of information about this notice, or any official matter connected with it, is prohibited except to the Federal Court of Australia and the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and the States for the purposes of any application challenging the validity of the notice, in which case the applicant's name is to be suppressed and replaced by a letter and/or number pseudonym, and where section 29B of the Act does not prevent such disclosure.
