 
 1 On 29 September 2008 I made orders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) convening three meetings to be held for the purpose of considering schemes of arrangement relating to a proposed merger between the plaintiff ("St George") and Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac").
These are the reasons why I made those orders.
