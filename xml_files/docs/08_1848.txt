 
1 I have before me an urgent application for leave to appeal against the decision of Burnett FM pursuant to s 24(1)(d) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and a notice of motion relating to that application.
The proceedings are urgent because the applicant, Ms George, seeks leave to appeal against an interlocutory decision of Burnett FM to refuse to stay a three-day hearing in the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court, which hearing is listed to commence before his Honour on the morning of Monday 8 December 2008, and a further stay of those proceedings.
2 In Court this morning Ms George was self-represented, and the first, second, third and fourth respondents were represented by Counsel.
Background facts 
 
3 Ms George is a bankrupt.
An Amended Application before the learned Federal Magistrate, filed on 7 November 2008 by William John Fletcher as trustee for the bankrupt estate of Ms George (the trustee in bankruptcy), is currently listed for hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court at Brisbane on 8 December 2008.
In these proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court (the substantive proceedings) the trustee in bankruptcy seeks final declaratory orders in the following terms:
 
1.
A declaration that the Heads of Agreement dated 19 February 2008 remains valid and enforceable.
2.
A declaration that as at 24 February 2006 the legal and beneficial ownership of 130 Landing Road, Moggill vests in the trustee.
3.
A declaration that there is no trust in favour of the bankrupt's minor son or any other person in respect of that property or any property stored or located there.
4.
A declaration that as at 24 February 2006 the legal and beneficial ownership of a Toyota Landcruiser and of a Hanoverian mare known as Stellamara vests in the trustee.
5.
A declaration that the deed of settlement between the trustee and Susan Jane Wilson dated 28 October 2008 remains valid and enforceable.
6.
An order that Susan Jane Wilson be joined to the proceeding.
7.
An order that Dr Peter Ironside Pty Ltd, Peter Ironside and the National Australia Bank be joined to the proceeding.
8.
That as at 24 February 2006 the legal and beneficial ownership of the items listed in Schedule A vests in the trustee.
9.
Any further or such order the Court deems fit.
4 The application before me arises from a hearing in the substantive proceedings on 18 November 2008 before Burnett FM, where Ms George sought a stay of hearing of particular matters listed for hearing on 8 December 2008.
The matters Ms George sought to have stayed in the substantive proceedings were as follows:
 
1.
The Heads of Agreement dated 19 February 2008 remain valid and enforceable.
2.
As at 24 February 2006, the legal and beneficial ownership of lot 30 on SP145714 County of Stanley, Parish of Moggill, title reference 50440445 (the Landing Place property) vests in the applicant as trustee of the bankrupt estate.
3.
There is no trust in favour of Alexandra George, the bankrupt, or any other person in respect of the Landing Place property; and
 
4.
As at 24 February 2006 the legal and beneficial ownership of items listed in schedule A vests the trustee of the bankrupt estate.
5 These matters related to paras 1, 2, 3 and 8 of the trustee in bankruptcy's Amended Application filed 7 November 2008.
6 The application for a stay in the substantive proceedings before his Honour resulted from the commencement of separate proceedings by Ms George in the Supreme Court of Queensland (the Supreme Court proceedings) in April 2008.
The Supreme Court proceedings involved claims by Ms George for declarations that she was trustee for her son in respect of property the subject of the substantive proceedings, in particular the Landing Place property.
I note that the learned Federal Magistrate found (at [9]) that there was a common substratum of facts and issues arising in relation to claims by Ms George in the Supreme Court of Queensland, and claims by the trustee in bankruptcy in the substantive proceedings.
This finding is not disputed by the respondents before me, although in Court this morning Ms George disputed his Honour's finding that she was not necessarily in disagreement with this finding.
I understand from submissions of Counsel for the trustee in bankruptcy that, after the trustee in bankruptcy was joined as a party to the Supreme Court proceedings by order of the Court, there was commonality between the parties to the Supreme Court proceedings and the parties to the substantive proceedings.
The joinder of the trustee in bankruptcy to the Supreme Court proceedings is not in dispute.
7 The application brought by Ms George before his Honour for a stay of the substantive proceedings was listed for hearing before his Honour on 18 November 2008.
It is not in dispute that, on that morning, Ms George applied for an adjournment of the stay application for a number of reasons including (in summary) a power cut which had affected her ability to be ready for the hearing, the fact that she had been served with material by the respondents approximately 2 hours 20 minutes late, and that she was ill on that day with medical certificates to support that assertion.
8 The Federal Magistrate refused to adjourn the hearing of Ms George's application for a stay and, after hearing the application, refused it.
His Honour's reasons appear in Fletcher  George (No 5) [2008] FMCA 1628.
