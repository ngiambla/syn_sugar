 BACKGROUND 
 
 1 On 14 November 2006 a child was injured when her mother fell over a Telstra pit lid situated on a public foothpath ('the incident').
It was not in dispute that, at the time of the incident, no employees or contractors of Telstra were working at or near the pit or the pit lid.
The evidence was that the most recent time that the pit lid may have been moved to access the pit beneath was 8 September 2006 to locate a fault.
Telstra's records indicated that the pit beneath the pit lid would have been accessed on less than 20 occasions between 1996 and the date of the incident.
2 Telstra owns and controls in excess of six million pits and pit lids throughout Australia.
The pit lid is an access point to the pit.
Pit lids and pits are regarded by Telstra as long term assets and are constructed as such.
The pit is an underground void in which telecommunications cables are jointed and protected from the elements and from accidental or deliberate damage.
The pit is installed to allow access to, and maintenance of, Telstra's underground network.
The pit is accessed only when it is necessary to perform tasks such as connecting a new customer service or locating a fault.
Telstra is responsible for maintaining its pits.
3 Telstra generated a health and safety incident report about the incident.
Telstra provided that report to the second respondent, Comcare, on 15 November 2006.
Telstra was obliged to report notifiable events to Comcare.
On 16 November 2006 Telstra sought to withdraw the notification on the basis that it had been reported to Comcare in error.
Telstra asserted that the incident was not a notifiable event because it had not occurred at a workplace under Telstra's control.
4 Comcare did not accept the withdrawal of the notification.
By email dated 21 November 2006, Comcare informed Telstra that Comcare had commenced a reactive investigation into the incident and that Mr William Smith would be the investigator.
In a subsequent email dated 21 November 2006, Comcare informed Telstra that the reactive investigation commenced by Mr Smith would examine Telstra's compliance with s 17 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth) ('the Act').
By letter dated 24 November 2006, Mr Smith sought the production of documents and a response to questions pursuant to s 43 of the Act.
Various correspondence ensued.
5 By letter dated 26 February 2008, purportedly pursuant to s 53(4) of the Act (and on behalf of the third respondent), Comcare required Telstra to respond to recommendations contained in a report prepared by Mr Smith, purportedly under s 53(1) of the Act ('the report').
6 The report found that the incident was a dangerous occurrence as defined in s 5 of the Act, and was therefore notifiable to Comcare under s 68 of the Act and reg 37A of the Occupational Health and Safety (Safety Arrangements) Regulations 1994 .
There was no dispute, for the purposes of this proceeding, that the incident did qualify as a dangerous occurrence.
7 The report also concluded that Telstra breached s 17 of the Act in respect of the incident.
That section provides:
 An employer must take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that persons at or near a workplace under the employer's control who are not the employer's employees or contractors are not exposed to risk to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the employer's undertaking.
Note: An employer who breaches section 17 may be subject to civil action or a criminal prosecution (see Schedule 2) 
8 Telstra was not given a draft of the report, nor notice of the conclusions contained within it, prior to its publication.

In each of these cases (as in other specified instances) there is the availability of an appeal (s 48).
