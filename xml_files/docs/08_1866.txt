 
1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 19 August 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of 17 January 2008.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant pursuant to s 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').
BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who arrived in Australia in December 2005.
On 21 December 2005 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.
A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on 3 January 2006.
On 10 January 2006 the appellant applied to the First Tribunal for a review of that decision.
The First Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate on 27 March 2006.
The appellant applied for judicial review of that decision, and on 13 July 2006, the Federal Magistrates Court ordered, by consent, that the matter be remitted to a Tribunal.
On 9 November 2006, a differently constituted Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate ('the Second Tribunal').
The appellant applied for judicial review of that decision, and on 31 July 2007, the Federal Magistrates Court ordered that the matter be remitted to a third Tribunal.
This appeal concerns the decision of the third Tribunal, heard before Mr Short ('the Third Tribunal').
3 The appellant claimed to fear persecution in Bangladesh for reason of his political opinion.
He claimed to be a member of the Awami League ('the AL') and to fear harm from members of the rival Bangladesh National Party ('BNP') and Jamaat-Islami ('JI').
The appellant claimed that he had worked for the AL in his local district, where he was its Publications Secretary from 1982 until 1985.
He claimed that he was threatened and attacked by BNP and JI members in 1991, and made the subject of false charges of murder and robbery in 2002; a warrant had been issued for his arrest on 20 May 2002.
The appellant claimed that he left Bangladesh on his own passport in February or March 2003 to join a cargo ship in Europe, and returned in January 2004 using his own passport, before again leaving to Australia in October 2005.
He claimed that his son had been arrested for three days in 2004, and that he had been told his son had disappeared in February 2006, and that the appellant feared he had been kidnapped.
THIRD TRIBUNAL DECISION 
 
4 The Third Tribunal found that the appellant was not a witness of truth.
In particular, it found that the appellant's evidence was inconsistent and not credible.
