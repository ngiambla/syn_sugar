Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 1) [2008] FCA 1760) and also in relation to a notice of motion filed 16 May 2008 ( Bing!
Software Pty Ltd v Bing Technologies Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 1761).
In summary, I found that the conduct of the first and second respondents had infringed the applicant's registered trade mark, but that the effect of compliance with an oral undertaking given by the first respondent during the hearing of the primary proceedings was that the infringement of the applicant's registered trade mark by the respondents ceased.
Notwithstanding that undertaking however, I allowed the application in part because I considered that the applicant was entitled to an injunction based upon the oral undertaking.
Upon giving judgment I directed the parties to make submissions as to the terms of the injunction in light of the reasons given in my judgment.
I also directed that the parties make submissions as to costs.
2 On 3 December 2008 Counsel for the parties made oral submissions, based upon their outlines of argument filed 28 November 2008.
Injunctive Relief 
 
3 In written submissions the applicant submitted that, in accordance with s 7(4) and s 120(1) Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Act "), the injunction should read as follows:
 The Respondents are restrained by injunction from using as a trade mark a sign comprising the word bing, or any other sign that is deceptively similar to Trade Mark 836622, upon, or in physical or other relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
