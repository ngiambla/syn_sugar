 
1 This proceeding is concerned with the operation of ss 27A(1) and 27CD of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ( the Assessment Act ).
Those provisions afford an exemption to a taxpayer in respect of certain foreign termination payments made to the taxpayer.
2 Section 27CD of the Assessment Act relevantly provided that, if an exempt non-resident foreign termination payment is made in relation to a taxpayer, the taxpayer's assessable income does not include that payment.
The term exempt non-resident foreign termination payment is defined in s 27A(1) of the Assessment Act as meaning, relevantly, a payment made in respect of a taxpayer to which the following apply:
 
(i) the payment is made in consequence of the termination of that taxpayer's employment;
 
(ii) the payment would be an eligible termination payment;
 
(iii) that employment was service in a foreign country; and
 
(iv) the payment related solely to a period of the employment during which that taxpayer was not a resident of Australia.
3 The applicant, Mr Michael Branson ( the Taxpayer ), received a payment on 1 May 2003 from Deutsche Australia Limited ( Deutsche Australia ).
The payment was made following the termination of his employment by Deutsche Australia upon his redundancy.
At the time of the termination, the Taxpayer had been on secondment in Tokyo, Japan with Deutsche Securities Limited ( Deutsche Securities ), a company related to Deutsche Australia.
4 The payment made to the Taxpayer on 1 May 2003 was the sum of $535,068.03.
That sum was made up as follows:
 Repatriation allowance: $23,875.00 Annual leave: $125,307.35 Long service leave: $125,277.85 14 month termination payment ( the Redundancy Payment ): $497,068.83 Total: $771,529.03 Less income tax deducted: $236,461.00 Net payment: $535,068.03 

 
5 At the same time as that payment was made to the Taxpayer by Deutsche Australia, Deutsche Securities also made a payment to the Taxpayer of $595,040.17.
That sum was made up as follows:
 Guaranteed bonus for 2002 calendar year: $700,000.00 Less tax: $140,00.00 Net payment (AUD): $560,000.00 Net payment annual leave --- Japan accrual (calculated in JPY then converted to AUD) $35,040.17 Net payment: $595,040.17 

 THE ASSESSMENT 
 
6 The Taxpayer claimed, relevantly, that, by reason of the operation of s 27CD, his assessable income for the relevant tax year did not include the amount of the Redundancy Payment of $497,068.83.
Following an unfavourable objection decision by a delegate of the respondent, the Commissioner of Taxation ( the Commissioner ), the Taxpayer sought review of that decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( the Tribunal ).
On 24 January 2008, the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner's decision that the Taxpayer's assessable income included the amount of the Redundancy Payment.
The Taxpayer then appealed to the Federal Court pursuant to s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ( the Tribunal Act ).
THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL 
 
7 The Taxpayer was employed by Deutsche Australia from June 1992.
In 2000, he agreed to be seconded to the Tokyo branch of Deutsche Securities.
The terms of the secondment were evidenced by a letter of 28 July 2000 to the Taxpayer from Deutsche Bank AG and a letter of 9 August 2000 to the Taxpayer from Deutsche Securities.
8 The letter of 28 July 2000 confirmed the Taxpayer's assignment to Deutsche Bank, Tokyo.
The letter stated that, during the period of the assignment, the terms contained in the letter were to prevail over any of the Taxpayer's terms of employment with Deutsche Australia that may be inconsistent with any of the terms of the letter.
The letter stated further that the Taxpayer's employing company would continue to be Deutsche Australia throughout the assignment.
The letter dealt with the expected period of assignment, the Taxpayer's remuneration and incidental matters such as transportation and relocation allowances.
The letter of 9 August 2000 confirmed the Taxpayer's assignment to Deutsche Securities and dealt with the date of commencement and the duration of the assignment, the salary payment to be made by Deutsche Securities and other incidental matters concerning the terms of the secondment.
9 On 14 October 2002, while still on secondment pursuant to those arrangements, the Taxpayer was informed by a representative of Deutsche Australia that his position had become redundant.
Because of the termination of the Taxpayer's employment with Deutsche Australia, his assignment with Deutsche Securities was also terminated.
Thus, the Taxpayer worked in Tokyo from 1 August 2000 to 15 October 2002 and was resident in Japan for the whole of that time.
The Taxpayer returned to Australia on 22 December 2002.
10 On 17 October 2002 the Taxpayer was informed by telephone that he would be paid an amount in lieu of notice equal to three months' salary.
The Taxpayer responded that that was totally unacceptable and was not consistent with his understanding of the practice of Deutsche Australia.
11 On 5 November 2002 Deutsche Bank AG wrote to the Taxpayer setting out the termination payment, repatriation and other arrangements arising as a consequence of the Taxpayer's redundancy, effective 15 October 2002.
The termination payment was to include a sum in Australian dollars and another sum in Japanese yen.
The Australian dollar amount included the sum of $262,625 as a termination payment equal to 11 months' salary.
The Japanese yen payment included a payment in yen of 2.5 months' notice.
The letter stated the "home shadow salary" on which the Australian dollar amounts had been calculated.
The letter also stated that the 2.5 month notice period payment had been calculated at the Taxpayer's net salary rate in yen.
12 On 18 November 2002 the Taxpayer's solicitors wrote to Deutsche Australia saying that the termination payments proposed in the letter of 5 November 2002 reflected only part of the Taxpayer's lawful entitlements.
The letter then recited the employment history of the Taxpayer with Deutsche Australia and his secondment to Japan.
It also stated the details of bonuses and salaries received while on secondment to Japan.
The letter went on to assert that, since there was no express agreement between Deutsche Australia and the Taxpayer as to the length of notice required to terminate his employment, he was entitled to reasonable notice.
The letter then asserted as follows:
 Given our client's length of service, relocation on assignment, current location, experience, seniority, the expected period of time it would take him to find alternative employment (having regard to the deterioration in market conditions), notice of 18 months would be reasonable.
A payment of three months' notice is insufficient.
The letter went on to demand a payment in lieu of reasonable notice calculated on the basis that the reasonable notice period was 18 months.
The letter asserted that the proposed redundancy payment of 11 months' base monthly salary based on the Taxpayer's Australian shadow salary did not reflect his entitlement at law.
13 Deutsche Australia's solicitors replied on 9 December 2002.
After reciting various contentions and arguments, the letter made an offer on behalf of Deutsche Australia to make a payment of a sum in Australian dollars representing an actual payment or payment in lieu of a total of 14 months' salary.
The payment was to be in full and final satisfaction of any entitlements that the Taxpayer may have "to notice of termination and redundancy pay".
That proposal is consistent with the proposal in the letter of 5 November 2002.
That is to say, the 14 month calculation involved 11 months' redundancy pay and three months' payment in lieu of notice.
14 The proposal for redundancy pay and notice is reflected in redundancy guidelines of Deutsche Australia published to various employees on 25 May 2001.
The announcement stated that the formula for redundancies was as follows:
 
 
 
 Redundancy: 1 month per year of service or part year thereof with a minimum of 2 months and uncapped.
Notice: 3 months for Directors and Managing Directors and 1 month for all other staff.

 
 

At that stage, the Taxpayer was designated as a "Director".
15 On 12 December 2002, the Taxpayer's solicitors responded to the letter of 9 December 2002.
Their letter canvassed various arguments on behalf of the Taxpayer and included the assertion that the Taxpayer did not accept the proposition that a three month period was reasonable and maintained that 18 months was reasonable for the circumstances that had previously been advised.
16 A draft Statement of Claim by the Taxpayer against Deutsche Australia in the Supreme Court of New South Wales was provided to Deutsche Australia's solicitors on a without prejudice basis in February 2003.
While that draft was not before the Tribunal, a Statement of Claim that was subsequently filed made a claim for a payment equivalent to 24 months' salary.
An inference can therefore be drawn that the draft Statement of Claim made such a demand.
17 In any event, following the provision of the draft Statement of Claim to Deutsche Australia's solicitors, they wrote again to the Taxpayer's solicitors on 26 February 2003, saying that Deutsche Australia proposed to pay the Taxpayer the sums that it believed he was entitled to in connection with the termination of his employment and some additional amounts as a gesture of good faith.
After referring to payments that had already been made, the letter said that Deutsche Australia proposed to pay a further net total of $1,052,426.72.
That sum included the sum of $497,068.82, which was described as follows:
 Termination payment for any other entitlements on termination, including payment in lieu of notice and redundancy.
The letter went on to assert that the payment to the Taxpayer would not include a payment in lieu of 24 months' notice, which was said to be "unreasonable and unjustifiable on any analysis, having regard to [the Taxpayer's] contractual entitlements and circumstances".
18 The Taxpayer's solicitors responded on 2 April 2003 taking issue with a proposal in the letter of 26 February 2003 to deduct tax in respect of certain of the payments.
The letter asserted that Deutsche Australia would have no compulsory Australian or Japanese withholding obligations in relation to payments referable to the Taxpayer's Japanese employment, such as the redundancy payment and the Japanese annual leave payments.
The letter asserted that such payments were plainly not eligible termination payments within s 27A of the Assessment Act.
19 On 10 April 2002, the Taxpayer's solicitors wrote again to the solicitors for Deutsche Australia, indicating that a point of difference appeared to be withholding tax from the amount referred to as the 14 month termination payment.
The letter relevantly said:
 Although your client might conceive that our client's redundancy should be 14 months because he is a long standing employee, he will nevertheless be paid solely because his Japanese position, being the relevant employment within paragraph (iii) of the definition [in s 27A] was made redundant by your client.
He was a non-resident during the whole time of the relevant employment and the payment will be made only in relation to the redundancy from that employment.
His previous employment in Australia, whilst it might operate in the mind of your client in determining the quantum of the payment, is of "historical significance only," and is not a causal factor in the making of the Japanese employment redundancy payment... 
20 As I have said, the payments were then made on 1 May 2003 under cover of a letter from Deutsche Australia's solicitors to the Taxpayer's solicitors of that date.
The letter enclosed a termination payment schedule showing the calculation of an Australian Related Net Payment of $535,068.03 and a Japan Related Net Payment of $595,040.17.
21 However, the Taxpayer was still not content and, on 30 June 2003, commenced a proceeding against Deutsche Australia in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, claiming damages for wrongful termination of his employment without adequate notice.
The proceeding was subsequently settled and on 8 June 2005 a Deed of Release was entered into between the Taxpayer and Deutsche Australia.
After reciting, inter alia , the two payments that had already been made on 1 May 2003 by Deutsche Australia and Deutsche Securities, the Deed of Release provided that Deutsche Australia would make a further payment of $700,000 to the Taxpayer as an additional discretionary bonus.
In addition, the Deed of Release contained mutual releases of the parties.
22 In the Deed of Release the payment of $535,068.03 was stated to represent a gross amount of $771,529.03 comprising the following:
 Repatriation allowance: $23,875.00 Payment in lieu of untaken Australian annual leave: $125,307.35 Payment in lieu of untaken Australian long service leave: $125,277.85 14 months' salary, representing a payment in lieu of notice of 3 months and an additional payment pursuant to Deutsche Australia's redundancy guidelines of 11 months' pay calculated by reference to the Taxpayer's Japanese salary: $497,068.83.
