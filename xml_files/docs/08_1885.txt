1 The issue on which this judgment ultimately turns arises from a statement by the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the RRT') constituted under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') that it preferred to rely, for information about conditions in Algeria, on information obtained through its own researches than on material supplied by the appellant.
One report referred to, and relied upon by the appellant was actually the current and most up to date version of a report relied upon by the RRT.
Did the RRT's unexplained refusal to treat the latest version of the report as the most relevant amount to jurisdictional error on its part?
2 The appellant arrived in Australia on 12 July 2005 and applied for a protection visa on 11 August 2005.
His passport had been issued in Algeria on 8 August 2004 and was valid for five years.
He said that he had never previously travelled outside Algeria.
On 15 September 2005 a delegate of the first respondent ('the Minister') refused to grant a protection visa.
The appellant sought a review of the delegate's decision by the RRT.
The RRT affirmed the delegate's decision on 10 January 2006 ('the first RRT decision') but on 24 May 2007, by consent, the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('the FMCA') set aside the decision of the RRT and remitted the matter for further consideration.
On 15 May 2008 the RRT (differently constituted) again affirmed the delegate's decision.
On 12 June 2008 the appellant filed an application in the FMCA seeking judicial review of the second decision of the RRT.
In the latest proceedings before the FMCA the appellant was represented by counsel.
The grounds of the application for judicial review were amended a number of times.
In a judgment delivered on 28 August 2008 the FMCA rejected the grounds advanced in the final amended application for judicial review ( SZIGH v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 1203).
From that judgment the appellant has appealed to this Court.
3 Some opening observations are appropriate.
First, an applicant for a protection visa must assume the task of persuading the relevant decision-maker that a proper foundation exists for the grant of the visa.
A decision-maker is not obliged to uncritically accept every assertion made by such an applicant.
Secondly, the merits of a decision on whether a protection visa should be granted are shielded by the Act from judicial review.
Neither the FMCA nor this Court may substitute its own view of the merits of any application for a protection visa for that of the RRT.
Thirdly, the only basis upon which a decision to refuse a protection visa may be successfully challenged in the FMCA or in this Court is if jurisdictional error appears from the decision or processes followed by the RRT.
4 In the present case the appellant was not believed.
There were a number of reasons why that was so.
Prior to the second hearing before the RRT an email purporting to be from the appellant's brother was sent to the RRT.
That email alerted the RRT to the fact that the appellant had sought refuge in Thailand in 2000 and made further allegations against him.
Although the RRT decided it was not in a position to substantiate the further allegations and therefore decided not to take them into account it did make enquiries of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ('the UNHCR').
One matter disclosed by those enquiries was raised with the appellant in an oral hearing conducted before the RRT on 6 December 2007.
The RRT in its decision, refers to it in the following terms:
 I asked him about the claim in his visa application that he had never been convicted for a crime or offence.
Initially, he said that he had not, but, when I said he was not telling me the whole story, he admitted that he had been convicted in Thailand of using false documents and had been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.
After he served his sentence, he applied to UNHCR for protection.
The charge of using false documents arose from the fact that, on arrival in Bangkok, he had obtained a new and false passport in an attempt to reach Canada.
His first port of call was Hong Kong, where the false passport had been discovered and he had been sent back to Thailand, where he was arrested.
5 The appellant's response to the RRT appears also to have falsified his response in his application for a protection visa where he indicated that he had not travelled outside Algeria prior to coming to Australia.
6 Other inconsistencies were drawn to the appellant's attention in a letter written by the RRT on 7 December 2007, the day after the hearing.
In that letter the following was said:
 'You are invited to comment on/respond to information that the Tribunal considers would, subject to any comments/response you make, be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review.
