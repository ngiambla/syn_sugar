 
1 This is an application by the liquidators of Australian Capital Reserve Limited (in Liquidation) ( ACR ) for an order under s 511(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that they would be justified in not declaring any interim or final dividend to ordinary unsecured creditors of ACR that would involve distribution of funds received or to be received under an agreement described below ( the Agreement ) until the expiry of a period of at least six months following the respective dates of receipt of those funds.
2 The factual material which the liquidators put before me in support of the application is contained in an affidavit of Mr Gregory Winfield Hall sworn 8 December 2008.
The affidavit exhibits a large number of documents contained in Exhibit GHW1.
A number of confidential documents, including a confidential statement of Mr Hall are contained in Confidential Exhibit GWH2.
Mr T F Bathurst QC, who appears for the liquidators, concedes that it is appropriate for me to refer to so much of the confidential statement as is necessary to disclose my reasons for judgment.
3 Notwithstanding the bulk of the evidentiary material, the essential facts may be stated shortly.
ACR was the fundraising vehicle for Estate Property Group Limited group of companies ( EPG Group ) which carried on the business of residential property development.
ACR raised funds from the public in a note issue and on-lent the funds to various companies in the EPG Group.
ACR went into voluntary administration on 28 May 2007 with liabilities of approximately $335 million, of which approximately $332 million was owed to a trustee for the note holders.
4 In September 2007, a series of agreements were entered into between the administrators of the EPG Group and Becton Investment Management Limited in its capacity as the trustee of the Becton Everest Fund ( Becton ), the effect of which was that Becton took control of the property development part of the EPG Group.
5 The structure of the Becton transaction was set out in a Heads of Agreement dated 30 August 2007 between, inter alia , ACR and Becton.
One of the agreements entered into pursuant to the Heads of Agreement was a Receivables Acquisition Deed.
That Deed, together with the Heads of Agreement and certain contracts for sale of land at Villawood and Werrington, provided for certain payments to be made by Becton to ACR.
The payments were to be made in three instalments, the last of which fell due on 1 December 2008.
The amount due under the final instalment was nearly $54 million.
