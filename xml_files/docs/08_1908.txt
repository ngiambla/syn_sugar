 BACKGROUND 
 
1 The following background to these appeals, which is not contentious, is, for the most part as set out in the respondent's written submissions.
2 The applicants were participants in an Australian aloe project ("project") and for the years ended 30 June 1998 ("98 year") and 30 June 1999 ("99 year") variously claimed deductions in relation to the project.
3 A delegate of the respondent disallowed the deductions claimed under s 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ("97 Act") and, in the alternative, made determinations under Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ("36 Act") disallowing the deductions claimed if otherwise allowable.
The respondent also assessed additional tax by way of penalty.
4 On applications for review, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") affirmed the delegate's decisions on the objections.
5 The Tribunal found, in relation to the so-called "business limb" of s 8-1, that the applicants themselves were not carrying on a business.
Those findings precluded any necessity for the Tribunal to go on to consider the application of Part IVA of the 36 Act .
Nevertheless, the Tribunal considered, for the reasons set out in Barham v Commissioner of Taxation 2007 ATC 2633 , that Part IVA would have operated to disallow the deductions claimed.
6 In relation to penalty, the Tribunal found that the penalties imposed were appropriate.
7 The applicants' notices of appeal set out six questions which are said to be questions of law and fourteen grounds of appeal.
In each case, the primary relief sought is that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal for reconsideration.
8 The project involved a number of entities, including, relevantly:
 - Australian Aloe Limited (AAL); - Aloe Management  Marketing Limited (later called Australian Aloe Marketing Limited) (AMML); - Export Growth Finance Pty Ltd (Lender); and - Prospectus and Project Management Services Pty Ltd (PPM).
9 Warwick Young was a director of AAL.
He was also a director of AMML, the Lender and PPM, as was his son Sheldon Young.
Warwick Young was a shareholder in AAL, AMML, the Lender and PPM.
His family company, Bernawarra Pty Ltd, was also a shareholder in the Lender.
Sheldon Young too was a shareholder in AMML.
His family company, Rainy Bay Pty Ltd, was also a shareholder in the Lender.
10 Warwick Young drafted the prospectus.
Sheldon Young contributed to it.
PPM produced the prospectus.
11 Key documents for the project included:
 - the prospectus; - a Management Agreement set out in the prospectus; and - a License Agreement set out in the prospectus.
12 A finance package was also offered to participants in the project.
The relevant documents were:
 - a Loan Indemnity Agreement; and - a Loan Agreement.
13 The finance arrangements for the project involved a round-robin arrangement.
The effect was that the only money which was available to the project entities to carry out the project was the actual cash which was provided by the participants.
14 The prospectus offered three forms of investment --- "redeemable preference shares, 'A' Class shares and Interests arising out of the ownership of 'A' Class shares" .
According to the prospectus, a participant who acquired 2,000 A class shares could "exercise the right to a Licensed Interest [and] engage in their own business as a licensed marketer and seller of the full range of AAL's products" .
If the participant took up the finance package, "the maximum amount personally payable [was] $7,850" for each parcel of A class shares acquired.
"All future costs are funded by the Licensee's business.
If the business does not meet its projected income and there is a shortfall in funds available to make interest and principal repayments under the loan the Indemnifier must pay them".

 
15 The tax deductible expenditure was said to be, for each parcel of A class shares acquired:
 Year 1 Management and Marketing Fee $13,000 Year 1 License Fee $2,000 Year 1 Interest $1,350 Indemnity fee $400 Total $16,750 
16 The applicants invested in the project in the 1998 year and the 1999 year, although Bernadette Young did not claim any deductions in the 1999 year.
They claimed:
 Applicant 1998 year 1999 year Bernadette Young $16,750 - Warwick Young $167,500 $201,000 Sheldon Young $16,750 $33,500 THE COURT'S JURISDICTION 
 
17 The applicants rely upon the jurisdiction of the Court under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 ("AAT Act") to found their appeals.
18 This jurisdiction is limited to a pure question of law: Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321 at [18] ; Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 243 ALR 728 at [35].
The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition.
It is the subject matter of the appeal: TNT Skypak International (Aust) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1988] FCA 119 ; (1988) 82 ALR 175 at 178; Price Street Professional Centre at [40].
The competency of an appeal depends on the identification of a question, which is properly characterised as a question of law, as the subject of the appeal: Price Street Professional Centre at [22].
19 Whether a decision gives rise to a question of law that will support an appeal under s 44(1) requires consideration of how the decision was arrived at and the point that the litigant seeks to challenge: Price Street Professional Centre at [25].
The Court must consider the question sought to be raised and the grounds relied upon in support of the orders sought: Birdseye a t [18]; Price Street Professional Centre at [40].
NOTICE OF APPEAL 
 
20 The questions of law raised in each of the appeals are essentially identical: 
 
 
 2.1.
Whether the Tribunal failed to make material findings of fact, or alternatively, failed to make material findings of fact with sufficient particularity for it to determine whether the claimed outgoings were deductible under the first limb of section 8-1 of the 97 Act as required by s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 .
2.2.
Whether the Tribunal failed to apply the law to the facts as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the oral evidence of the Applicant that he applied for and was granted interests in the relevant project;
 
 (b) the oral evidence of the Applicant that all required agreements were executed between the relevant parties; and 
 
 (c) the evidence contained in the generic s 37 of the AAT Act documents outlining the recognition of the various project entities that the applicant executing the relevant project agreements, the annual reports of the project entities which identify the shares held by the Applicant in the scheme (and therefore a participant in the scheme); 
 
 
 
 
 and determine under section 8-1 of the 97 Act whether for the first limb of that section the Applicant incurred the claimed outgoings and whether there was a sufficient nexus between the claimed outgoings and the derivation of assessable income.
2.3.
Whether the Tribunal deprived itself of the ability to reach the correct and preferable decision by failing to make findings on all the material facts, or alternatively, failing to make findings on all the material facts with sufficient particularity.
2.4.
Whether the Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness in denying him the opportunity of presenting his case properly.
2.5.
Whether the Tribunal failed to make any material findings, alternatively, material findings with sufficient particularity as to whether or not a provision of Part VII of the 36 Act imposed additional tax by way of a penalty on the applicant.
2.6.
Whether the Tribunal failed to apply the law to the facts and determine under the 36 Act whether section 226L of Part VII of the 36 Act did not apply to remit the penalty imposed on the applicant to nil.

 
 Questions 2.1-2.3 and grounds 4.1-4.8: 97 Act s 8-1 
 
21 It was common ground that each of these concerns s 8-1(1)(a) of the 97 Act which the parties refer to as the "first limb" of s 8-1(1).
Section 8-1(1)(b) is referred to in the reasons of the Tribunal as the "business limb".
I will adopt the same expressions.
22 Section 8-1(1) provides: 
 8-1(1) You can deduct from your assessable income any loss or outgoing to the extent that: (a) it is incurred in gaining or producing your assessable income; or 
 
 (b) it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing your assessable income.
(Emphasis in the original)
 
 

23 There is a threshold question whether it is competent for the applicants to rely upon questions of law going to the first limb of s 8-1.
The applicants say that this provision was before the Tribunal for decision and indeed was the subject of decision by the Tribunal.
The respondent disputes this.
24 If the respondent is correct then the first three questions in each of the Notices of Appeal are incompetent.
I will deal with this question first.
25 The reviews by the respondent considered both limbs of s 8-1 and gave reasons in respect of each as to why the claimed losses or outgoings were not deductible.
This reflected the fact that the various objections by the applicants under s 14ZU of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ("TAA") to their relevant assessments had identified both limbs under s 8 - 1 as alternative bases for the claimed deductions.
26 For example Warwick Young's notice of objection contained the following: 
 
 
 2.
The said amount of $167,500 comprised losses or outgoings incurred by the taxpayer in gaining or producing assessable income, or in carrying on business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income, and was comprised of: 
 
 Costs ($) Marketing  Management fees 130,000 Licence fee 20,000 Indemnity fee 4,000 Interest 13,500 
 
 3.
The said losses or outgoings were incurred in the course of the Taxpayer's participation in the Australian Aloe Vera Limited Project ("Project"), the subject of a Prospectus lodged with the then Australian Securities Commission on 2 nd June, 1998 ("Prospectus"), and are allowable deductions under s 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ("ITAA 1997").

 .
.
.
6.
The said amount of $167,500 comprised, for the purposes of s8-1 of the ITAA 1997, losses or outgoings incurred by the Taxpayer during the relevant year in gaining or producing assessable income, or alternatively losses or outgoings necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income.

 
 
27 Each applicant submits that both limbs were before the Tribunal for consideration.
First they contend that by virtue of s 43 of the AAT Act that it is incumbent on the Tribunal to look at what was before the respondent afresh.
Second, they point to their Amended Statements of Facts, Issues and Contentions ("Statements") filed with the Tribunal.
Each contains the following paragraph: 
 The Applicant says that the facts upon which the Respondent purports to base his contentions cannot be substantiated.
Any objective view of the facts would disclose: 
 
 a) the Applicant was carrying on a business as a consequence of engaging in the Project in the 1998 and 1999 income years for the dominant purpose of making a profit.

 
Unless the dominant purpose was to make a profit the investment by the Applicant would have made no sense and would have been ridiculous.

 
 b) the deductions claimed were allowable pursuant to s 51(1) of the 1936 Act and s 8-1 of the 1997 Act for the 1998 and 1999 income years; 
 
 c) it was a loss or outgoing incurred in gaining or producing assessable income;
 
 d) further and alternatively it was a loss or outgoing necessarily incurred in carrying on business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income and 
 
 e) the loss or outgoing was of a revenue nature.

 
 
28 This paragraph, on its face, is somewhat ambiguous.
Each of sub-paras (a) and (d) concerns the business limb of s 8-1.
Sub-para (c) may or may not.
It contains language found in both limbs.
The applicants say that it refers to the first limb of s 8-1.
It sits in the first part of the paragraph which appears to deal with the business limb and before what is said "further and alternatively" at (d) but which is also referrable to the business limb.
29 The paragraph as a whole is in that part of each Statement headed "Contentions".
