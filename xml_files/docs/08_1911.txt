He was posted to the recruit training facility HMAS Leeuwin in Western Australia where he remained until the end of September in the following year.
2 On 24 January 2002 Mr Farnaby made a claim for compensation under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth).
He alleged that while at HMAS Leeuwin he suffered physical and sexual abuse which resulted in post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
His claim was disallowed.
That decision was affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by the Hon R J Groom (Deputy President) and Dr J Campbell (Member): Farnaby and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2008] AATA 603.
Mr Farnaby now appeals to this Court under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).
3 The transitional provisions of the 1988 Act required Mr Farnaby to show that, within the meaning of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act 1930 (Cth), he had suffered a "personal injury by accident arising out of or in the course of his employment": s 9(1).
"Injury" means "any physical or mental injury" (s 4(1)) or "disease ... due to the nature of (his) employment" (s 10(1)).
4 For the purposes of this appeal we are only concerned with Mr Farnaby's claim based on "mental injury".
PTSD is a mental injury.
5 The Tribunal accepted Mr Farnaby's account of physical and sexual abuse suffered at HMAS Leeuwin.
However, it was not satisfied that he had suffered mental injury or that such symptoms as he had were caused by events at HMAS Leeuwin.
