 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant ('the Land Council') seeks a declaration that no native title exists in land at Boat Harbour in the Local Government Area of Port Stephens, Parish of Tomaree, County of Gloucester, State of New South Wales, being Lot 576 in Deposited Plan 48823 ('the Land' or 'Lot 576').
This is a non-claimant application, commenced on 31 December 2004, for an approved determination of native title pursuant to s 13 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act').
An application may be made to the Court under Part 3 of the Act for a determination of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title (s 13(1)(a) of the Act).
A determination made on such an application will constitute an ' approved determination of native title ' (s 13(3)(a)) unless varied or revoked (s 13(4)).
2 The Land Council is a body corporate established under s 50 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW) ('the NSW Act') for an area delineated under s 49 of the NSW Act and known as the Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council Area, which includes the Land.
Membership of the Land Council is not confined by statute to persons with a traditional association with the area but, by s 54(2A) of the NSW Act, is open to adult Aboriginal persons who either reside within the Land Council's area or have a sufficient association with that area.
Membership is also open to Aboriginal owners in relation to land in that area.
Formal requirements 
 
3 The Land Council's non-native title rights and interests arose from the grant and transfer of the Land to the Land Council by the Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales ('the Minister') pursuant to s 36 of the NSW Act on 16 March 1998.
Following the transfer of the area that includes Lot 576, the Land Council holds a non-native title interest ' in relation to the whole of the area in relation to which the determination is sought '.
It is the holder of an ' an estate in fee simple ... subject to any native title rights and interests existing in relation to the land immediately before the transfer ' (s 36(9) of the NSW Act).
As the holder of such an interest, the Land Council is entitled under s 61(1) (Table, clause 2) of the Act to make the present application.
Section 40AA of the NSW Act prevents the Land Council from selling, exchanging, leasing, disposing of, mortgaging or otherwise dealing with the Land unless the Land is the subject of an approved determination of native title within the meaning of the Act.
4 On 11 October 2004, the Land Council resolved, pursuant to s 40D of the NSW Act, that Lot 576 was not of cultural significance to Aborigines of the area and to dispose of Lot 576.
The non-claimant application was lodged on 31 December 2004.
5 The proceedings were commenced by Peter Hillig in his capacity as administrator of the Land Council.
Following the cessation of his appointment, an order was made on 29 June 2007 substituting the Land Council as the applicant in these proceedings pursuant to O 6 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules .
The Minister was automatically joined pursuant to s 84(4) of the Act.
6 The non-claimant application was notified in accordance with s 66 of the Act:
 
a. in the Sydney Morning Herald on 23 February 2005;
 
b. in the Koori Mail on 23 February 2005; and
 
c. in the Port Stephens Examiner on 24 February 2005.
7 The notification period for the application (s 66 of the Act) was from 9 March to 8 June 2005.
There is no dispute that the application was appropriately published and notified and that the requirements of s 66 of the Act have been complied with.
8 A notice of intention to become a party to these proceedings was filed within the three month time period provided for in the s 66 notice by New South Wales Native Title Services Limited ('Native Title Services') and by Mr and Mrs Parkinson.
The application by Mr and Mrs Parkinson to be joined to the proceedings was dismissed ( Peter Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales, State Minister under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) [2006] FCA 61).
Native Title Services was joined as a party on 5 July 2005.
On 11 March 2008, an order was made granting leave to that party (whose name had been amended to NTS Corp Limited) to withdraw as a party to the proceedings.
9 I have recorded the history of this matter in Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2007] FCA 1357 (' Worimi 2007 ').
That history includes the striking out of two claimant applications filed by the third respondent, Mr Gary Dates, who prefers to be called Worimi.
I will refer to him as Worimi.
Each application was struck out pursuant to s 84C of the Act for failure to comply with s 61 ( Hillig as Administrator of Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales (No 2) [2006] FCA 1115 ; Worimi v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales [2006] FCA 1770 (' Worimi 2006 ')).
Worimi did not give notice within the notification period that he wanted to be a party to the non-claimant application.
On 30 March 2007, Worimi filed an amended notice of motion to be joined as a party to the non-claimant application pursuant to s 84(5) of the Act.
For the reasons set out in Worimi 2007 , I made an order that he be joined as a respondent to these proceedings.
10 No other person asserting the existence of native title in Lot 576 gave notice under s 84(3) of the Act within the notification period of a desire to be a party to the non-claimant application.
11 The hearing commenced over three years after lodgement of the non-claimant application.
The delay resulted from the numerous applications in this matter, from the application for joinder by Mr and Mrs Parkinson to repeated applications for adjournment by Worimi to enable him to prepare claimant applications, seek legal advice and file evidence.
In the time between the filing of the application and the hearing, no Aboriginal person other than Worimi has come forward seeking to become a party to the non-claimant application pursuant to s 84(5) of the Act.
No Aboriginal person other than Worimi has come forward to resist the declaration sought by the Land Council on the basis of a positive assertion of the existence of native title in relation to the Land.
The only Aboriginal people other than Worimi to come forward and to give evidence in these proceedings have done so as witnesses for the Land Council.
No claimant applications other than those filed by Worimi have been made asserting the existence of native title in the Land.
12 The Land has been described as "Worimi country" by Worimi and by other Worimi witnesses called by the Land Council.
Worimi places reliance on the evidence of these witnesses, Worimi people who were born and raised in the Port Stephens area and who have been claimants in previous native title applications over areas held by the Land Council close to Lot 576, and on their evidence that Lot 576 was part of "our traditional land" and that it falls within the boundaries of the Worimi nation.
13 During the course of the proceedings, there was a view of the Land and the place adjacent to the Land, described by Worimi as "the baptism place" on Kingsley Beach.
Only women inspected the beach site.
14 Section 61 of the Act identifies applications that may be made under Division 1 of Part 3 of the Act and identifies the persons who have standing to invoke the Court's jurisdiction by making such an application.
It is not in issue that the non-claimant application properly invokes the Court's jurisdiction.
