 
 1 On 2 May 2008 the respondent entered into a Personal Insolvency Agreement under Pt X of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).
The trustee of the PIA was the applicant.
2 At a meeting of the respondent's creditors held on 30 September 2008 a resolution was passed purporting to terminate the PIA under s 222B(1) of the Act.
That provision is as follows:
 The creditors may, by resolution at a meeting called for the purpose, terminate a personal insolvency agreement if: 
 
 (a) the debtor is in default; and 
 (b) before the passage of the resolution, the trustee of the agreement tabled at the meeting a written declaration to the effect that the trustee is satisfied that the debtor is in default.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

3 A dispute having arisen as to whether the requirements of par (b) were met, the applicant seeks a direction under s 134(4) of the Act as to whether or not the PIA was validly terminated.
