 
1 The applicant seeks leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision of the Federal Magistrates Court, SZEYK v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 1354 , in which Smith FM dismissed his application.
Previous history 
 
2 On 22 June 2004 the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirmed a decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse an application by the applicant for a protection visa.
On 23 March 2005 the Federal Magistrates Court made orders by consent quashing the decision and remitting it back to the Tribunal to be determined according to law.
The Tribunal (differently constituted) affirmed the delegate's decision on 27 October 2005 ('the second Tribunal decision').
3 In SZEYK v Minister for Immigration [2006] FMCA 1473 , Scarlett FM dismissed an application for review of the second Tribunal decision on the basis that it contained no jurisdictional error.
Justice Lander dismissed an appeal from that decision ( SZEYK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 133).
The applicant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court ( SZEYK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCATrans 640).
Justices Hayne and Crennan dismissed the application as there was:
 ... no reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusions reached in the courts below that the applicant established no ground for the relief of the kind he sought.
4 The applicant then commenced a second round of litigation challenging the second Tribunal decision.
In SZEYK v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 2095 , Emmett FM stated at [16] that the application was ' an abuse of this Court's process ' and ' unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive ' and ' likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute '.
5 Justice Buchanan dismissed an appeal from her Honour's decision ( SZEYK v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] FCA 70).
Once again, the applicant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court.
Justices Kirby and Heydon dismissed the application as an appeal would have no reasonable prospects of success ( SZEYK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 378).
The present application 
 
6 The applicant then made a further application to the Tribunal.
In its decision dated 7 July 2008 ('the jurisdiction decision'), the Tribunal (which I may also refer to as the third Tribunal) held that it did not have jurisdiction to conduct a second review of the delegate's decision as that decision had already been the subject of a valid review by the Tribunal and was no longer an RRT---reviewable decision under s 411 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').
The applicant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the jurisdiction decision.
Federal Magistrate Smith dismissed the application.
His Honour found that the application was ' plainly hopeless ' and dismissed it under r 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth).
7 In his application for leave to appeal, the applicant sets out a number of grounds.
The grounds are also reflected in the draft notice of appeal and in the applicant's affidavit in support of his application for leave to appeal.
It is not clear whether the grounds refer to the second Tribunal decision, which has twice been the subject of review by the Federal Magistrates Court, this Court and the High Court, or the jurisdiction decision.
Those grounds that refer to the second Tribunal decision do not relate to the jurisdiction decision the subject of the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court from which the applicant wishes to appeal and have no prospects of success.
8 When asked to explain his grounds of appeal and the basis for his application for leave to appeal, the applicant reiterated his complaints about the second Tribunal decision.
He repeated an assertion that the Tribunal had not asked him questions about his submissions and that it had made mistakes.
He said that the Tribunal, in considering his application for a protection visa, made a mistake so he was entitled to ' have the case reconsidered again '.
9 That is simply not the case.
The decision of the delegate that he seeks to have reviewed has already been reviewed at every level.
An attempt to relitigate with respect to decisions that have been the subject of litigation and consideration up to the High Court and found to be free of jurisdictional error is an abuse of the process of the Court and vexatious and oppressive: SZCNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 216 ; SZBPB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 164 ; MZXOW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 73.
10 The further application to the Tribunal was an impermissible attempt to relitigate the delegate's decision that had been the subject of review.
The High Court confirmed the absence of jurisdictional error in the second Tribunal's decision.
In these circumstances, the third Tribunal's duty was to assess whether it had jurisdiction before embarking upon a second or third review of the delegate's decision.
11 I turn to consider the grounds of appeal in the draft notice of appeal.
