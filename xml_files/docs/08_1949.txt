 The central issue 
 
1 The central issue in the matter presently before the Court concerns the application, if any, of s 388- 55 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act') to the variation of the period for the making of a choice, conferred by s 703-50 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the 1997 Act'), to consolidate a consolidatable group.
Section 388-55 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 
 
2 By virtue of s 3AA(1) of the Administration Act 'Schedule 1 has effect'.
3 Section 388-55 was inserted into the Administration Act by A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Act (No.
2) 2000 (Cth) (Act No.
91 of 2000).
It provided as follows:
 
 
 
 '388-55(1) The Commissioner may defer the time within which an approved form is required to be given to the Commissioner or to another entity.

 
 (2) A deferral under subsection (1) does not defer the time for payment of any amount to the Commissioner.

 
 
 
Note: Section 255-10 allows the Commissioner to defer the time for payment of an amount of a tax-related liability.
' 
 
 
 
 
 

4 Section 388-55 follows s 388-52 which was inserted into the Administration Act by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.
3) 2001 (Cth) (Act No.
73 of 2001).
Section 388-52 also used the expression 'an approved form is required to be given to the Commissioner or to another entity'.
It provided as follows:
 
 
 
 '388-52 Where an approved form is required to be given to the Commissioner or to another entity by, or on, a day (the lodgement day ) that is not a business day, the approved form may be given on the first business day after the lodgement day.
' 
 
 
 

5 The concept of approved forms, including returns, notices, statements, applications or other documents under a taxation law, being 'given' to the Commissioner is used extensively throughout the taxation laws.
For example s 161(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the 1936 Act') provides for persons who are required by the Commissioner to do so to 'give to the Commissioner' a return for a year of income within a specified period.
In relation to returns, notices, statements, applications or other documents that are required to be 'given' to the Commissioner, s 388-50(1)(d) allows the Commissioner to specify the manner in which they are to be given.
Notwithstanding the extensive use of 'give' or 'given' throughout the taxation laws, one finds in Explanatory Memoranda referable to the relevant Bills that 'lodge', 'lodged' or 'lodgment' have been used.
6 By virtue of s 3AA(2) of the Administration Act expressions used in Schedule 1 to the Administration Act have the same meanings as they have in the 1997 Act.
The definitions in the 1997 Act are to be found in s 995-1, which spans some 180 pages.
7 Apart from the definitions contained in s 995-1 there are expressions that are defined elsewhere in the 1997 Act, which supplement those definitions.
8 By s 995-1(1) of the 1997 Act ' this Act ' is defined to include:
 
 
 
 '(a) the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ; and 
 
 (b) Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 , so far as that Part relates to: 
 
 
 
(i) this Act [the 1997 Act] or the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ; or (ii) Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; and 
 
 
 (c) Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; 
 
 except in Division 950 (Rules for interpreting this Act).
' 
 
 


 
9 Whilst 'this Act' did not include the 1936 Act or Schedule 1 to the Administration Act where used in Division 950 (Rules for interpreting this Act), s 3AA(3) of the Administration Act provided:
 
 
 
 '3AA(3) Division 950 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (which contains rules for interpreting that Act) applies to Schedule 1 to this Act as if the provisions in that Schedule were provisions of that Act.
