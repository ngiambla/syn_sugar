2 The notice to produce referred to in pars 4 and 5 of the orders in [1] required the applicant to produce at the return of the applicant's subpoenas for production issued on 3 April 2008 the "litigation funding agreement entered into by the joint liquidators of the applicant ... and referred to in the statutory accounts lodged by the liquidators with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission".
3 The subpoenas of 3 April 2008 sought production of various documents by Stage 5 Pty Ltd (Stage 5), which is not a party to the proceeding.
On 7 May 2008 Stage 5 produced, amongst others, a number of documents it claimed to be privileged.
The documents the subject of the claim are those described in par 5 of Mr Glover's affidavit of 27 May 2008:

4 Within the time specified in par 6 of the Registrar's orders the applicant sought review of par 5 of the orders under s 35A(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
Its notice of motion seeks orders that:
