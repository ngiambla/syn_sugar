 
 1 On 12 November 2008, a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation made an application for the winding up of Scottsdale Homes Number 3 Pty Ltd. At that time, the sole director and the secretary of the company was one Dudley James Quinlivan.
2 On 27 November 2008, Mr Dudley Quinlivan resigned from each of these offices with the company.
He was replaced by a Mr Leo Ralph as the sole director and the secretary of the company.
I was informed, without objection, in the course of proceedings today by Mr Coulsen, on behalf of the administrators, that an event, which seems at least to have influenced the resignation of Mr Dudley Quinlivan as director and secretary of the company, was a disqualification order made by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in respect of his ability to be a director of a company.
A consequential application was made by him to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review on the merits of that decision, and a stay of the order of ASIC, which the Tribunal was disposed to grant.
It seems that as a matter of prudence, nonetheless, Mr Quinlivan decided to resign the directorship.
3 On 10 December 2008, Jason Walter Bettles and Susan Ruth Carter were appointed as administrators of the company.
The hearing date for the winding up application was originally fixed to be 11 December 2008.
Upon the winding-up application coming on before a registrar of the Court that day, an application was made for the winding up application to be adjourned, pursuant to s 440A(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
That particular application being beyond the jurisdictional remit of a registrar, the application was referred to a judge.
It came before me for hearing today.
4 On the application being called on for hearing, the material initially relied upon on the part of the administrators comprised an affidavit of Mr Bettles sworn on 10 December 2008, and a further affidavit of Mr Bettles sworn on 15 December 2008, the latter being filed by leave.
It was a matter of comment in the course of submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner by one of his officers, Mr Cleary, that there was an absence of sworn material on the part of related companies.
An opportunity was extended, which was taken up by the administrators, for the case to be stood down to determine whether or not it was desired that the application proceed on existing materials.
5 In the result, a further affidavit came to be relied upon by the administrators.
That is an affidavit of Mr Dudley Quinlivan, which was sworn today at Bundall on the Gold Coast, and filed by leave without objection.
To understand the relevance of that particular affidavit and its contents, some brief recitation of the background to the winding up application and the state of affairs of the company, as best the administrator has presently been able to ascertain them, is necessary.
6 There are no secured creditors of the company.
The most significant creditor, and by a large margin, is the Commissioner of Taxation ("the Commissioner").
At the time when the report as to affairs was prepared, the company was indebted to the Commissioner, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, in the sum of $592,668.40.
That particular debt attracts a general interest charge, such that a sum now in excess of $600,000 is owed to the Commonwealth and payable to the Commissioner.
7 The other unsecured creditors are each, in one way or another, companies which are controlled by Mr Dudley Quinlivan.
