 
1 There is a motion by the appellant before the Court seeking, amongst other things, expedition of the appeal.
That is effected in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion.
Paragraph 2 of the notice of motion is not pressed.
The motion is not opposed by the respondent by reference to any asserted prejudice.
Mr de Kerloy, appearing for the respondent, has simply put before the Court matters, which in his submission, the Court ought be informed in the process of making its reasoned judgment as to whether or not the motion ought be granted.
2 The motion is supported by affidavits of Dr Rajumati Bhula affirmed on 2 and 15 December 2008.
The respondent has filed an affidavit of Dr Ross Rainbird sworn 12 December 2008.
It is the fact, as is evident from the judgment at first instance, that the name and address of the manufacturer in relation to products, the subject of entry in the relevant record of the register, were in each case fictitious.
3 The appellant acknowledges rightly that it needs to demonstrate special circumstances in order to take it out of the ordinary course of how appeals in this Court are disposed of.
