1 This judgment deals with an application for an extension of time in which to appeal against a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('the FMCA').
The judgment was delivered on 5 September 2007.
Under O 52 r 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules an appeal is available against a decision of the FMCA within 21 days from the date of judgment.
Thereafter leave to file an appeal out of time is required.
The present application was filed on 3 October 2007.
Although the delay is not a very large one O 52 r 15(2) indicates that special reasons must be provided for the grant of an extension of time.
2 The application was supported by an affidavit filed also on 3 October 2007.
It said the following:
 
 
 '1.
I am the Appellant in the matter filed against the order judgement of Federal Magistrate Nicholls FM dated 12 September 2007.

 
 
 
 
 
 2.
The Federal Magistrate Court of Australia at Sydney dismissed the matter by an order dated 12 September 2006.

 
 
 
 
 
 3.
I have good grounds to challenge the order dismissed by the Federal Magistrate.

 
 
 
 
 
 4.
I have filed my grounds of appeal in the Notice of Appeal.

 
 
 
 
 
 5.
I request that my appeal may be taken on file and I may be given permission to file additional grounds, if necessary, at a later stage.
' 
 
 
 

3 The grounds of appeal were set out in two ways.
First, there was a ground stated in a draft Notice of Appeal in the following terms:
 
 'The learned Trial Judge erred in law by not finding that the Refugee Review Tribunal had made a jurisdictional and factual error in reaching the conclusion that the Appellant is not entitled to Protection Visa.

 

4 Secondly, the following additional matters were then set out:
 
 
 '1.
The Tribunal made jurisdictional error and factual error in concluding that the applicant is not entitled to a protection visa.
The Federal magistrate has not noted that point.

 
 
 
 
 
 2.
The Refugee Review Tribunal falied to see that the applicang satsfies all the crieterai that are required for a "refugee" status under the Act and rules.
It is surprising how the Federal Magsitrate did not deal with this.
' 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.
The Tribunal committed factual and legal error in failing to conclude the applicant falls under Article 1A(2) of Convention which defines a refugee.

 
 4.
The applicant satisfies all the four key elements to Convention definition.
But both the Tribunal and the Federal Magsitrate had not given the finding in favour of the appellant.

 
 5.
The Tribunal failed to accept the real and correct facts as stated by the applicant in person but has relied on some other facts and stories which are not correct.
Therefore the Tribunal has commtted factual error.
By committing such factual error the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error and this had been overcome by the Federal Magsitrate.

 
 6.
The Tribunal failed to consider the real facts, but ha accepted from an individual.
The Tribunal failed to see that such individuals are well placed and protected.

 
 7.
The Tribunal is not correct in stating that the applicant did not receive serious harm which will amount to persecution.

 
 8.
The Tribunal erred in not accepting the statement of the applicant that he was hunted for religious reason.

 
 
 
 
 
 9.
The Tribunal has erred in stating that no convention reason or reasons for persectioin have been proved.

 
 10.
The Tribunal has not applied its mind properly and has hastily dismissed the case.

 
 11.
The Tribunal erred in concluding that the applicant will enjoy protection of Indian Police and other security institutions.
The Tribunal has completely overlooked the seriousness of the matter.

 
 
 
 The applicant seeks permission to file additional grounds at a later stage, if required.

5 None of this material provides any reason why an extension of time should be granted.
None of it explains the delay in seeking to engage the processes of this Court.
6 At the hearing of his application the applicant did not address such matters at all.
