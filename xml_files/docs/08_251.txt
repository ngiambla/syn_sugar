 Background 
 
1 Mr Rountree ("the applicant") is a New Zealand citizen.
When he arrived in Australia in 1996 he was granted a special category visa class TY subclass 444 under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("Migration Act").
2 On 23 May 2007 the applicant's visa was cancelled on character grounds by a delegate of the Minister under s 501(2) Migration Act .
The applicant applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") to review that decision.
The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate ( Rountree and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 1615).
3 The applicant has now filed an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from a decision of the Tribunal and a draft notice of appeal from a decision of the Tribunal.
4 At the hearing before me the applicant was present in Court, and self-represented.
The respondent was represented by Ms Wheatley of counsel.
Jurisdiction of the Federal Court 
 
5 As a general rule, appeals from decisions of the Tribunal to the Federal Court are permitted by s 44(1) Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("AAT Act") which provides:
 
 A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding.


6 This position is, however, modified by s 483 Migration Act which states:
 
 Section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 does not apply to privative clause decisions or purported privative clause decisions.


7 A decision or purported decision to cancel a visa under the Migration Act is a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision within the meaning of s 474(3)(b) Migration Act .
In this case, it is clear that the decision of the Tribunal, which reviewed and affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate to cancel the applicant's visa under the Migration Act , was also a privative clause decision or purported privative clause decision.
Accordingly, an appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal concerning such a decision does not lie within s 44 AAT Act , and is not competent (cf Epenisa v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 80 and Boyes v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 505).
8 Nonetheless if the applicant's visa has been cancelled on the basis of a decision infected by jurisdictional error, the Court has jurisdiction to consider an application to have the decision quashed: Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476.
9 In this case the applicant has not framed his application in terms of judicial review of the Tribunal's decision, or sought to have that decision quashed pursuant to s 39B Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
However at the hearing the applicant applied for leave to have the errors of law raised in his draft notice of appeal deemed to be grounds for review.
This application for leave was not opposed by the Minister and leave was granted.
Decision of the Tribunal 
 
10 The Tribunal identified the two issues in the application before it as:
 
1.
Whether the applicant did not pass the character test in s 501(6)(a) because of his past and present criminal conduct and, if so
 
2.
Whether the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to set aside or affirm the decision made by the delegate of the Minister to cancel the applicant's visa.
