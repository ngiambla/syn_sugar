1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") has been investigating allegations of price fixing by Korean Air Lines ("KAL") and other international carriers since mid 2006.
The allegations relate to the imposition of fuel and other surcharges on air cargo into and out of Australia.
2 On 12 October 2007, a senior lawyer in the employ of the ACCC telephoned a partner in the firm of Clayton Utz, the solicitors for KAL.
The terms of the conversation are disputed.
The ACCC contends that the conversation was with "without prejudice" but KAL contends that the ACCC lawyer put a proposal to the Clayton Utz partner of a settlement of proceedings which would be brought against KAL seeking pecuniary penalties under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (" the TPA ") for price fixing.
3 On or about 31 October 2007, the Clayton Utz partner, Mr Bruce Lloyd, informed the ACCC lawyer, Mr Glenn Owbridge, that KAL had rejected the proposal and did not wish to advance a counter-offer.
4 On 31 October 2007 the ACCC issued a notice under s 155(1)(a) of the TPA requiring KAL to provide information in writing relating inter alia to the tonnage of air cargo carried into Australia between 2001 and 2007, including revenue derived from fuel surcharges.
5 KAL challenges the validity of the s 155 notice.
It contends that the notice was issued for the improper purpose of depriving KAL of the protection of the Court's processes which would otherwise be available to it upon the commencement of proceedings for the recovery of pecuniary penalties.
6 The final hearing of KAL's application is listed for hearing on 20 March 2008.
However, a dispute has arisen between the parties about the production of documents sought by KAL from the ACCC under a notice to produce.
7 The dispute is limited to [5] of the notice which seeks production of documents created by four very senior officers of the ACCC who have been involved in various aspects of the investigation.
