 
 1 On 22 November 2006 the now Appellant lodged an application for a bridging visa.
That application was refused on 7 December 2006 and the now Appellant lodged an application for review with the Migration Review Tribunal on 28 December 2006.
2 The Migration Review Tribunal on 19 June 2007 affirmed the decision not to grant a Bridging A (Class WA) visa.
The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking to impugn the Tribunal decision: SZJOH v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1978.
The Appellant now appeals to this Court.
3 It is also relevant to note that the now Appellant had previously sought review by the Refugee Review Tribunal of a decision refusing to grant a protection visa.
The application for a protection visa had been made in January 2006 and refused in April 2006.
The Refugee Review Tribunal on 5 October 2006 dismissed the application for review upon the basis that it had no jurisdiction.
The application had been lodged outside the prescribed time.
On 24 October 2006 the now Appellant sought judicial review of that decision of the Tribunal.
This appeal was dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 December 2006: SZJOH v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural Affairs [2006] FMCA 1890.
4 It is considered that the appeal must be dismissed for the reasons previously given by both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Federal Magistrates Court.
The Grounds of Appeal seek to characterise the errors as being errors of law, jurisdictional error and procedural fairness.
There is also a ground which asserts that the Federal Magistrate did not apply Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government  Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437.
The grounds are expressed in the most general terms but content may be given to them if reference is made to the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate.
5 The Appellant's written submissions filed in this Court also make a submission as to a breach of s 359A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
6 It is considered that each of the Grounds of Appeal should be dismissed as should the submission in respect to s 359A.
7 There has been no jurisdictional error and no error of law, either on the part of the Tribunal or the Federal Magistrate.
NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE MIGRATION REGULATIONS 
 
8 Provision is made in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) for the grant of a visa: s 65.
Section 73 provides for the grant of a " bridging visa ", provided an applicant satisfies criteria which may be prescribed by regulation: s 31(3).
Failure to satisfy those criteria requires a refusal of the application: SJSB v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 225 at [15] per Ryan, Jacobson and Lander JJ.
9 For present purposes, the regulations of relevance may be found in Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth), being regulations 010.211 and 010.221.
Those regulations relevantly provide as follows:
 
 010.21 Criteria to be satisfied at the time of application.
010.211 (1) The applicant meets the requirements of subclause (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6).
(2) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 (a) the applicant has made, in Australia, a valid application for a substantive visa of a kind that can be granted if the applicant is in Australia; and 
 (b) that application has not been finally determined;... 
 ...
 
 (3) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 ...
 (c) at the time of that application, he or she held a Bridging A (Class WA) or Bridging B (Class WB) visa; .... 
 ...
 (4) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 ... 
 (b) he or she has not applied for a Protection (Class AZ) or Protection (Class XA) visa; ... 
 ...
 (5) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 (a) the applicant has made a valid application for: 
 [specified visas]...; 
 ...
 (6) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if: 
 (a) the applicant has made a valid application for: 
 ...[specified visas]; and 
 ...
 010.22 Criteria to be satisfied at the time of decision.
010.221 The applicant continues to satisfy the criterion set out in clause 010.211.


10 For the reasons given by the Migration Review Tribunal, the Appellant does not satisfy Clauses 010.211(2), (3), (4), (5) or (6).
The now Appellant did not satisfy Clause 010.211(2)(b) as his application for a protection visa had been " finally determined " at the time of his application in November 2006.
That phrase is further defined by s 5(9) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
In the circumstances of the present case, the application for the protection visa had been " finally determined " as the delegate had refused the application and there had been no review " instituted as prescribed " within the meaning of s 5(9)(b).
The Appellant did not satisfy cl 010.211(3)(c) as he was not the holder of a bridging visa A or B; he did not satisfy cl 010.211(4)(b) as he had applied for a protection visa; and there was no evidence that he had applied for a class of visa prescribed by cl 010.211(5)(a) or (6)(a).
RANDHAWA ?

 
11 The decision of the Full Court in Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government  Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 is a decision as to the definition of a " refugee ".
Its relevance to the present proceedings, other than an impermissible attempt to now recanvass the earlier unsuccessful claims for a protection visa, is not apparent.
AN INVITATION TO COMMENT: SECTION 359A 
 
12 The written submission on the part of the Appellant that there has been a breach of s 359A is also rejected.
If the submission is to be construed as an application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal to raise an additional ground of appeal, the application for leave is refused.
It was not an argument raised before the Federal Magistrate and no explanation has been advanced as to why the argument should now be entertained: Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1.
13 A letter was in fact forwarded to the Appellant pursuant to s 359A inviting him to comment on the matters therein set forth.
