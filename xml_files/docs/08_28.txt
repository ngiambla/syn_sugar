 
1 The applicants are officials employed by unions engaged in the building and construction industry.
The respondent is the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Building and Construction Commission ("the ABCC").
The ABCC has commenced an investigation into alleged contraventions of s 816 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the WR Act "), that being one of the functions conferred on it by the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) ("the BCII Act ").
2 Section 816 of the WR Act provides:
 
 A person who: 
 
 
 (a) threatens, intimidates or coerces another person; or 
 (b) prejudices another person; 
 
 
 because the other person: 
 
 
 (c) provided, or proposed to provide, information to the Commission; 
 (d) produced, or proposed to produce, documents to the Commission; or 
 (e) appeared, or proposed to appear, as a witness before the Commission; 
 
 
 is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by imprisonment for not more than 12 months.

 

3 Under s 4 of the WR Act , "Commission" means the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ("the AIRC").
4 The issue arising for determination is whether the investigation is being conducted for a purpose not permitted by s 52 of the BCII Act .
The legislative context 
 
5 Section 52(1) of the BCII Act provides, so far as is material:
 
 
 (1) If the ABC Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that a person: 
 
 
 (a) has information or documents relevant to an investigation; or 
 
 
 
 (b) is capable of giving evidence that is relevant to an investigation; 
 
 
 
 
 the ABC Commissioner may, by written notice given to the person, require the person: 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 (e) to attend before the ABC Commissioner, or an assistant, at the time and place specified in the notice, and answer questions relevant to the investigation.

 
 
 
 

6 Under s 52(6)(b)(iii) of the BCII Act , if a person, who has been given a notice under s 52(1) , fails to attend to answer questions at the time and place specified in the notice, that person is subject to a penalty of six months imprisonment.
The same applies to a person who fails to answer questions relevant to the investigation while attending as required by the notice; see s 52(6)(v).
7 An investigation is defined by s 52(8) to mean: "an investigation by the ABC Commissioner into a contravention, by a building industry participant, of a designated building law.
"
 
 

8 "Building industry participant" includes a union official in the building and construction industry and "designated building law" includes the WR Act : see s 4.
9 Under s 53 , a person is not excused from answering a question on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate that person.
However, such an answer, or information obtained as a consequence of it being given, is not admissible in evidence against the person in proceedings under the WR Act .
The investigation 
 
10 On 26 February 2007, Ms Melissa Martino, an inspector employed by the ABCC commenced a proceeding in the AIRC seeking the revocation of a permit held by Mr Adrian McLoughlin ("the McLoughlin proceeding").
The permit enabled Mr McLoughlin to enter and inspect certain premises in accordance with Pt 15 of the WR Act .
11 In the AIRC proceeding, Ms Martino filed witness statements of Craig Peterson and Stephen Broadhead on 4 April 2007.
Mr Peterson and Mr Broadhead are each employed in a managerial capacity by a construction company called Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd ("Bovis").
12 The ABCC has raised an allegation contained in a notice sent to the first applicant, Mr Washington, to answer questions relevant to an investigation undertaken by it (being the investigation the subject of this matter) that the second applicant, Mr Setka, engaged in threatening, intimidating and prejudicial conduct towards Mr Peterson.
The conduct was said to have occurred at a barbecue at Docklands Park on 23 May 2007 and to consist of derogatory comments made about Mr Peterson and also by Mr Setka including a direction to those at the barbecue to call Mr Peterson, "Lassie".
The purported reason for the alleged conduct was that Mr Peterson had provided information to the AIRC and proposed to appear as a witness before it in the McLoughlin proceeding.
13 The ABCC has also raised an allegation that, on 20 June 2007, at a building site at 500 Collins Street, Melbourne, Mr Setka and/or Mr Washington and the third applicant, Mr Mier, threatened, intimidated or prejudiced Mr Peterson and Mr Broadhead by distributing a flyer which contained derogatory comments about them allegedly because they each provided information to the AIRC and each proposed to appear as a witness in the McLoughlin proceeding.
14 On 10 and 11 July 2007 respectively, Mr Broadhead and Mr Peterson gave evidence in the McLoughlin proceeding in the AIRC before Watson SDP.
15 In a decision published on 29 August 2007, in Re Australian Building and Construction Commission [2007] AIRC 717 at [233] , Watson SDP ordered the suspension of Mr McLoughlin's permit until 31 October 2007 and ordered him in the interim to:
 
 ...undertake appropriate training about the rights and responsibilities of a permit holder under Part 15 of the Act, and the relationship of those rights and responsibilities with entry rights under the Victorian OHS Act and appropriate legislative means of challenging allegedly unreasonable requests on behalf of occupiers.

 

16 The ABCC has raised further allegations that on 6 September 2007, outside the Yarra Arts site, Mr Setka threatened, intimidated or prejudiced Messrs Peterson and Broadhead allegedly because each of them had provided information to the AIRC and appeared as a witness in the McLoughlin proceeding.
It is alleged that Mr Setka made threats of violence to Mr Peterson and assaulted Mr Broadhead.
17 By letter dated 6 September 2007, Mr Warren Cruse, an investigator employed by the ABCC, wrote to Mr Washington, requesting that he attend for an interview "in furtherance to" an investigation by the ABCC into "a suspected contravention of section 816 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 ".
18 On 8 October 2007, the ABCC served a notice on Mr Washington requiring him to answer questions at an investigation.
The notice was dated 28 September 2007.
The investigation was said to concern suspected contraventions of s 816 of the WR Act by Mr Setka and Mr McLoughlin at four named construction sites.
19 After correspondence between the ABCC and the legal officer of Mr Washington's union, the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union ("CFMEU"), the ABCC, by letter dated 22 October 2007, withdrew the notice dated 28 September 2007 directed to Mr Washington.
20 On 30 October 2007, the ABCC served a further notice on Mr Washington dated 29 October 2007.
