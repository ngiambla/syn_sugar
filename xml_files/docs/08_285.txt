 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') determined that Mr Maganga is entitled to compensation in respect of an injury to his left knee, said by him to have been sustained while he was on his way to work.
The primary question before the Tribunal was whether Mr Maganga injured his knee at home or while on his way to his work with the Department of Health and Aging.
It is fair to say, as Comcare submits, that Mr Maganga's credibility loomed large in the proceedings.
2 During the course of the Tribunal hearing, Comcare sought leave to inspect certain summonsed documents which related to a previous injury.
The Tribunal refused leave.
The issue in this appeal, brought under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'), the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act') and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), variously framed, is whether the Tribunal denied Comcare procedural fairness in refusing that leave.
Mr Maganga does not challenge the competency of the s 44 AAT Act appeal.
That is, Mr Maganga accepts that a denial of procedural fairness properly founds a question of law under s 44.
In any event, such a denial would found a basis for judicial review under the ADJR Act.
Chronology of the various injuries 
 
3 The injury complained of by Mr Maganga and considered by the Tribunal occurred on 29 November 2004.
However, prior to this injury, Mr Maganga had made other claims in respect of injuries to his left knee.
4 Mr Maganga claimed to have injured his left knee twice in Bourke in February 1997.
Mr Maganga said that he suffered an injury on 14 February 1997 to his left knee while ' walking home from work through the streets in town ' when he was assaulted ('the first injury').
Mr Maganga also said that he injured his knee on 15 February 1997 when he was assaulted ('the second injury').
The second injury was the subject of a successful claim for criminal injuries compensation which was submitted the following year with the NSW Victims Compensation Tribunal ('the victim claim').
5 On 24 February 2006 Mr Maganga completed a claim for compensation in respect of the first injury.
That claim was refused by Comcare, inter alia, on the basis that it was not satisfied that the injury had occurred while Mr Maganga was travelling home from work.
6 Mr Maganga also said that he injured his left knee on 13 August 2003, again on his way to work ('the third injury').
Mr Maganga claimed workers' compensation in respect of that injury.
Liability was refused by Comcare.
7 The left knee injury in dispute in these proceedings was said by Mr Maganga to have occurred on 29 November 2004 while he was on his way to work ('the fourth injury').
Mr Maganga claimed workers' compensation for the fourth injury in December 2004.
Liability to pay compensation for this injury was denied on the basis that Comcare was not satisfied that it had occurred while Mr Maganga was on his way to work.
Review by the Tribunal 
 
8 Mr Maganga initially sought review in the Tribunal in respect of Comcare's denial of compensation regarding the first, third and fourth injuries.
9 The reviewable decisions in respect of the three claims came, together, to the Tribunal.
The Tribunal issued directions in all three proceedings on 21 November 2006 that Mr Maganga file and serve material relating to the victim claim.
No such material was filed and served.
The three applications were listed for hearing together.
On 7 and 12 June 2007, the Tribunal issued summonses to the NSW Victims Compensation Tribunal and to Mr Maganga's former solicitors for production of criminal injuries compensation records.
10 On 15 June 2007, Mr Maganga discontinued the proceedings for the first and third injuries.
11 The hearing of the application in respect of the fourth injury was heard on 18 June 2007.
The primary issue was whether the fourth injury had, in fact, occurred on the way to work.
There were no witnesses to the injury and credit was strongly in issue.
12 During the hearing in the Tribunal Mr Maganga was cross-examined, over objection, on the injuries of 1997.
The cross-examination covered the number of injuries and the claim form for the first injury.
Counsel for Comcare specifically asked if Mr Maganga had claimed compensation with Comcare for the first injury and Mr Maganga said that he had not.
However, when shown the claim form Mr Maganga said that he had indeed claimed compensation for that injury but that he had been confused by the question.
Mr Maganga was also questioned on the circumstances of the fourth injury and certain apparent inconsistencies were put to him, such as where he said the injury had occurred and at what time.
13 Comcare says that it had reason to believe that when Mr Maganga lodged the claim for workers' compensation in February 2006 for the first injury he may have falsely characterised that injury as a "journey" injury.
