 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Barnes FM dated 24 October 2007.
Barnes FM concluded that the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) was correct in its decision that it no longer had jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision in relation to the applicant's application because it had previously conducted a proper review of that decision: see S1494/2003 v Minister for Immigration  Anor [2007] FMCA 1849 at [9] and [10].
Barnes FM therefore dismissed the applicant's application for review of the RRT's decision pursuant to rule 13.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 on the ground that the application had no reasonable prospects of success.
HISTORY 
 
2 The history of this matter is lengthy, and dates back to June 2000 when the applicant first arrived in Australia.
Most of the details of that history are set out at [3]-[5] of Barnes FM's decision.
It emerges from that history that the applicant has only ever obtained one decision from the delegate of the Minister on his application for a protection visa; that was on 23 August 2000.
Based upon that decision, the applicant has now pursued two rounds of review.
Significantly both of these rounds of review commenced with an application to the RRT to review the delegate's decision of 23 August 2000.
