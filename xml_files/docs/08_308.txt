2 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.
He arrived in Australia on 22 December 2000 and applied for a protection visa on 31 January 2001.
On 3 April 2001, a delegate of the Minister decided to refuse to grant a visa.
On 3 May 2001, the appellant lodged an application to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
3 After a hearing on 30 April 2003, the Tribunal, on 27 May 2003, affirmed the delegate's decision.
The appellant then commenced a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking judicial review of the decision of 27 May 2003.
On 16 March 2005, the Federal Magistrates Court ordered that the decision be set aside and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for further consideration according to law.
4 After a further hearing on 19 May 2005, the Tribunal, differently constituted, once again decided, on 24 July 2005, to affirm the delegate's decision.
On 10 August 2005, the appellant commenced another proceeding in the Federal Magistrate Court seeking review of the Tribunal's decision of 24 July 2005.
On 15 March 2006, the Federal Magistrates Court ordered, by consent, that the decision of 24 July 2005 be set aside and that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal again for further consideration according to law.
5 After a further hearing, on 8 June 2006, the Tribunal constituted differently again, decided, for the third time, on 29 August 2006, to affirm the delegate's decision.
The appellant then commenced a third proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court on 25 September 2006 seeking judicial review of the decision of 29 August 2006.
After a hearing on 18 May 2007, a judge of the Federal Magistrates Court ordered, on 21 August 2007, that the proceeding be dismissed with costs.
The appellant then filed notice of appeal to the Federal Court on 11 September 2007.
I have now considered written submissions on behalf of the appellant and the Minister and have heard a full oral hearing of the appeal.
THE TRIBUNAL'S THIRD DECISION 
 
6 In the material lodged with his visa application, the appellant claimed to belong to the minority Bihari community in Bangladesh, which he claimed is subject to oppression by the mainstream Bengali community in Bangladesh.
Biharis were stranded Pakistanis, being the victims of conflict between former East Pakistan and West Pakistan.
The appellant claimed that a number of his relatives had been killed after a so-called liberation war in 1971 at the hands of the Awami League.
He claimed that Bihari women were raped, tortured and that the property of Biharis was seized by the Awami League and their agents.
He claimed that, after a military coup in 1975, the military generals who ruled Bangladesh were not in a position to pay any attention to resolve the problems faced by Biharis.
7 The appellant asserted that he had been educated in Bangladesh despite serious discrimination in schools and colleges, having graduated in 1998.
He said that from an early age he was involved in activities with the Stranded Pakistani General Repatriation Committee ( the SPGR Committee ) and was one of its youngest leaders and activists.
He claimed that the aim of the SPGR Committee was to pressure the Pakistani and Bangladeshi governments to repatriate Biharis to Pakistan and to obtain civil rights as citizens of Pakistan.
He claimed that the Pakistani government does not have any intention to repatriate Biharis as there are political pressures against such a move from many inside the country.
He also claimed that the Bangladeshi government does not consider Biharis as Bangladeshi citizens because their leaders directly opposed partition in 1971.
8 The appellant claimed that the Bihari people did not assimilate with the Bangladeshi community.
He said that the Bangladeshi government does not take care of stranded Pakistanis and their welfare and that the government does not have policies in relation to stranded Pakistanis.
Rather, the Bangladeshi government sought to evict them from concentration camps by attempting to cease relief supplies to their camps.
He claimed that on a number of times Bihari camps were set on fire and Biharis were tortured in order to evict them from the camps.
9 The appellant also claimed that the Awami League, when it came to power through a parliamentary election in 1996, did not tolerate stranded Pakistanis because of their role in 1971.
He claimed that on a number of occasions, Awami activists attacked the camp where he lived.
He claimed that he led the barricade opposing them and that he subsequently became their main target.
He claimed that on a number of occasions he was beaten mercilessly but that, when he reported the matter to the local police, they did not take any proceeding against the Awami culprits.
He claimed to have led a number of processions against Awami thugs and urged the Bangladeshi government to punish those who wanted to evict the Biharis from their camp.
He also claimed that local Awami activists filed a number of false cases against him to ruin his future.
He claimed his situation became uncontrollable and he was finally compelled to leave Bangladesh to protect his life.
10 The Tribunal considered that the appellant's evidence was very unsatisfactory.
However, it was prepared to accept that he is a Bihari, as he was able, more or less correctly, to answer questions about Biharis at the hearing conducted by the Tribunal on 8 June 2006.
However, the Tribunal had serious reservations about the remainder of the appellant's claims.
11 In its reasons for its decision of 18 August 2006, the Tribunal referred to earlier hearings before the Tribunal.
The Tribunal said that all attempts by the Tribunal, as previously constituted, to elicit details of the appellant's activities on behalf of the Bihari community produced information on activities of only a very minor kind.
The Tribunal, as finally constituted, considered that there was nothing in the activities in which the appellant claimed to have participated that would justify or explain the laying of false charges against him by any group.
12 The Tribunal observed that, in response to a letter given to him by the Tribunal on 8 June 2006, the appellant stated that his most active period of involvement with the SPGR Committee was between 1994 and 1997 yet he claimed that a second false charge was brought against him in 1999.
The Tribunal did not consider that credible and did not accept the assertion.
The Tribunal did not accept that any false charges had been brought against the appellant.
13 The Tribunal said that it did not accept the appellant's claims that, as a result of opposing Awami thugs on a number of occasions, he was beaten mercilessly.
The Tribunal expected that, if that were true, the appellant would have had "some physical evidence, of such repeated and merciless beatings".
The fact that the appellant did not submit any such evidence satisfied the Tribunal that there was none to submit.
14 The Tribunal then referred to the applicant's claims to have gained his education with difficulty.
The Tribunal observed that gaining a tertiary education in Bangladesh is a rare privilege and that only just over 0.5% of the population in Bangladesh attended tertiary institutions.
The Tribunal found that the situation is worse for Biharis than for the general population and observed that the right to a basic education had become a luxury for Bihari children.
The Tribunal observed that, while the appellant may or may not come from a wealthy family, there being no evidence on the point, the appellant has been very privileged to gain the education that he has.
15 In summary, the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant had suffered harm amounting to persecution in the past in any way whatsoever.
The Tribunal found that a substantial proportion of the Bihari community lived outside camps, were integrated into the local community, were eligible to receive passports, to vote and to attend college and were able to exercise most of the rights of citizens.
The Tribunal found, in effect, that the appellant is one of those Biharis who are integrated into the broader community.
16 The Tribunal then referred to a letter, bearing the date 10 July 2002, purportedly written by the president of the SPGR Committee.
That letter relevantly states:
 
 This is to certify that [the appellant] is personally known to me since a pretty long time.
He is a bona fide stranded Pakistani ... 
 
 He has been living and leading a very miserable and inhuman life in camp along with thousands and thousands of stranded Pakistanis who are subject to social discrimination and oppression by the mainstream community for their role during liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971 ... 
 
 He is an active young and energetic member of our organisation who had most actively participated in all movements, agitation, demonstration and procession of this organisation for which he had to suffer heavily both mentally and physically.
He had even been implicated in false and fabricated cases.
He had been targeted by many quarters because of his involvement with [the SPGR Committee].
He is not safe and secured in Bangladesh which compelled him to leave the country ... 
 

The Tribunal accepted advice obtained from an appropriate source by the Australian High Commission at senior official level, that the letter was not genuine.
17 The Tribunal also referred to a letter of 12 August 2006 purporting to be signed by the General Secretary of the SPGR Committee, which relevantly said:
 
 This is to certify that [the appellant] is known to me.
He is a Stranded Pakistani (commonly known as Bihari refugee) ... 
 He had been living a miserable and inhuman life in Bangladesh together with thousands and thousands of stranded Pakistanis deprived of all human rights.

 

The Tribunal characterised that letter as being expressed in such exaggerated terms as to lack all credibility.
18 The Tribunal accepted that, as an educated Bihari, the appellant encouraged children to go to school and may have engaged in other low level social welfare activities on behalf of his community.
However, the Tribunal did not accept that anything that the appellant did attracted the hostile attention of any other group or that any other group took or threatened any action against him.
The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a leader or an activist.
The Tribunal accepted country information that indicated that the problems of the Biharis who live in camps in Bangladesh are not active hostility but lack of opportunity, neglect and poverty.
The Tribunal found that, while some Biharis may have a well founded fear of persecution, the appellant is not one of them.
19 The Tribunal did not accept that there is a real chance that the appellant will suffer harm amounting to persecution should he return to Bangladesh in the foreseeable future.
The Tribunal therefore found that the appellant does not have a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate not to grant the appellant a protection visa.
THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 
20 In his amended application of 14 December 2006, the appellant relied on seven grounds which might be summarised as follows:
 
1.
The Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A of the Act, in that it failed to disclose to the appellant the particulars of advice received from the Australian High Commission that the letter of 12 August 2006 was not genuine.
That appears to be a misapprehension, since it was the letter of 10 July 2002 that was the subject of advice from the Australian High Commission.
2.
The Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A of the Act, in that it treated the particulars of information that would be a reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review as being properly identified by examination of the reasons of the Tribunal differently constituted.
3.
The Tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness by failing to disclose to him, or offer him an opportunity to comment on or controvert, matters that were significant, relevant, credible and adverse to his application for review.
4.
The Tribunal had an appearance of bias in that it prejudged the critical factual issues raised by the appellant's application for review.
5.
The Tribunal failed to comply with s 425 of the Act, in that it failed to give the appellant a meaningful opportunity to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.
6.
The Tribunal took into account irrelevant considerations of a personal or whimsical nature.
7.
The Tribunal failed to consider whether the appellant was a member of a particular social group of Biharis in Bangladesh.
Each of those grounds was further particularised in the amended application.
21 In its reasons for judgment, the Federal Magistrates Court dealt carefully with each of the seven grounds, the particulars of some of which overlapped with others.
Since not all grounds were pressed in the appeal it is unnecessary to deal with the reasons of the Federal Magistrates Court in any detail except for one matter.
22 That matter concerns an observation made by the Federal Magistrates Court to the effect that s 422B of the Act, which states that Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Act is an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule, applied in the present case.
The primary judge found that no breach of the provisions of Div 4 had been established and that, accordingly, there was no denial of procedural fairness.
The Minister concedes that the observation was erroneous.
That error, however, does not necessarily dispose of the appeal.
It is still necessary to consider whether there was a denial of procedural fairness over and above any failure to comply with the provisions of Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Act.
THE APPEAL 
 
23 The notice of appeal of 11 September 2007 contains six grounds.
Ground 1 concerns the erroneous reference to s 422B.
That, of itself, does not constitute a ground on which the appeal can succeed.
Ground 2, which referred to the letter of 12 August 2006 was abandoned as a misconception.
Grounds 3 and 5 are effectively the same ground.
