 
1 This is an application for judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("ADJR Act").
Mr Colin George Dunstan is the applicant and in his Statement of Claim dated 4 November 1998 he challenges what he alleges to be three decisions made under the Public Service Act 1922 (Cth) as it was in 1997 ("PSA").
The first decision he identifies was made by Mr John Robert Growder on 4 June 1997 when, as an authorised officer under s 61(2) of the PSA, Mr Growder informed an authorised person under s 63B that he was of the opinion that the applicant may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer.
Mr Growder is the third respondent to the application.
The second decision he identifies was made by Ms Robyn Mary Orr on 4 June 1997 when, as a delegate of the relevant Secretary under s 63B, Ms Orr received the information from the third respondent previously referred to and decided to suspend the applicant from duty.
Ms Orr is the first respondent to the application.
The third decision he identifies was made by Mr John Neville Higham on 13 October 1997 when, as an authorised officer under s 61(2), Mr Higham decided under that subsection to charge, and did in fact charge, the applicant with failing to fulfil his duty as an officer.
2 In his amended application for review the applicant refers to decisions in addition to the three decisions identified in the Statement of Claim.
He refers to a decision by the first respondent on 7 July 1997 to continue the suspension of the applicant, to a failure by the second respondent to decide if the applicant should be charged, and to a decision by the first respondent on 17 October 1997 to suspend payment of the applicant's salary.
The second respondent's alleged failure to decide if the applicant should be charged is dealt with elsewhere in these reasons.
Putting that particular matter aside I think it is appropriate to proceed by reference to the case pleaded in the Statement of Claim dated 4 November 1998 because that is the case the respondents came to meet at trial.
3 The applicant contends that each of the three decisions is a decision to which the ADJR Act applies and he claims orders under s 16 of the ADJR Act quashing those decisions and other orders.
It is not immediately apparent in the circumstances of this case what orders would be appropriate under s 16 if one or more of the decisions were liable to be impugned.
The parties seem to be agreed that a sum of money is at stake being lost salary between 13 October 1997 and 3 December 1998, although they are not agreed as to the amount.
On 4 December 1998 the applicant was arrested and charged with offences involving the sending of explosive devices through the post.
The applicant tendered a list of the names of persons to whom he sent the devices.
They included the second and third respondents and a solicitor at the AGS who had handled the matter.
The applicant was convicted on a number of counts and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 9 years commencing on 26 May 1999 with a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on the same date.
I do not need to explore the issue of relief any further because on my findings none of the decisions are liable to be impugned.
4 The applicant's dispute with the ATO, its officers and others has a long history.
A good deal of the history is summarised in other judgments of this Court and I refer in particular to Dunstan v Farr (1999) 60 ALD 192; Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885.
5 I will refer to each of the acts or events as a "decision" using that word in a broad sense.
In due course, it will be necessary for me to address whether each of them is a decision within the provisions of the ADJR Act .
It should be noted that neither party suggested that the conduct provisions of the Act are relevant (s 6).
6 The applicant alleges that in the case of each decision, there was an error of a type falling within s 5 of the ADJR Act .
7 In relation to the first decision, the applicant alleges that the third respondent committed a breach of the rules of natural justice (s 5(1)(a)) , that his decision involved an improper exercise of the power in s 63B of the PSA (s 5(1)(e)) and that there was no evidence or other material to justify the decision made by the third respondent (s 5(1)(h)).
8 In relation to the second decision, the applicant alleges that the first respondent committed a breach of the rules of natural justice, that the first respondent did not observe the procedures that were required by law to be observed in connection with the decision (s 5(1)(b)) and that the first respondent's decision involved an improper exercise of the power in s 63B of the PSA.
9 In relation to the third decision, the applicant alleges that similar errors (in terms of the errors identified in s 5 of the ADJR Act ) were made by the second respondent as were made by the first respondent in the case of the second decision and that, in addition, there was no evidence or other material to justify the decision made by the second respondent.
10 Each of the respondents submits that the decision made by him or her was not a decision to which the ADJR Act applied.
It is submitted that none of the alleged decisions was a "decision" to which the Act applied as that word has been interpreted in the authorities.
In the alternative, each respondent submits that the decision made by him or her did not involve an error of the type alleged by the applicant.
In the further alternative, each of the respondents submits that even if the applicant overcomes the first two hurdles, relief should be refused in the exercise of the court's discretion.
It is convenient to deal with the last submission at this stage.
The respondents rely on s 10(2)(b) of the ADJR Act which is in the following terms:
 
 (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1):
 ... 
 
 
 
 (b) the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court may, in its discretion, refuse to grant an application under section 5 , 6 or 7 that was made to the court in respect of a decision, in respect of conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a decision, or in respect of a failure to make a decision, for the reason: 
 
 
 
 (i) that the applicant has sought a review by the court, or by another court, of that decision, conduct or failure otherwise than under this Act; or
 (ii) that adequate provision is made by any law other than this Act under which the applicant is entitled to seek a review by the court, by another court, or by another tribunal, authority or person, of that decision, conduct or failure.


11 The respondents rely on s 10(2)(b)(ii) and submit that adequate provision is made under the PSA for the review of the decisions.
That submission must be rejected because none of the appeal or review provisions in the PSA were available to the applicant in the case of the decisions, or any one of them.
No inquiry into the charges was ever held.
12 On the fourth day of the trial the applicant applied to amend his statement of claim.
By his application to amend, the applicant sought to add two new causes of action each giving rise, so it was alleged, to a right to damages against the first respondent and the third respondent respectively.
After hearing submissions, I refused the application to amend.
It is convenient for me to set out my reasons for doing so at this point.
13 The proposed amendment contained an allegation by the applicant that the first respondent owed him a duty of care and that she acted in breach of that duty by certain conduct performed in the second half of 1997 and the first half of 1998.
I will not outline the alleged breaches in detail but they include a failure to ensure an inquiry under s 62 was conducted and a failure to ensure statutory requirements were complied with after the applicant was notified that his position was excess.
The proposed amendment also contained an allegation that the first respondent and the third respondent acted in breach of the applicant's contract of employment.
Again, I will not outline the particulars of the alleged breaches.
The proposed amendment also contained an allegation that the respondents' actions aggravated or exacerbated the applicant's pre-existing psychological condition, and that his psychological condition led to his loss of employment.
Although it is not entirely clear, it would seem that the applicant sought by the amendment to claim damages from the respondents for the loss of his employment or, at the very least, for psychological injury.
14 In considering the application for leave to amend, I had regard to the well-known principles referred to in the decision of the High Court in The State of Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146.
15 The applicant sought to put forward new and quite different claims at a very late stage of the trial.
It was clear, at least from the respondents' point of view, that it was likely that if the amendments were allowed, witnesses would have to be recalled and new witnesses may need to have been called.
If the amendments were allowed, the trial would have had to be adjourned and it was likely that another pre-trial set of procedural orders would need to have been made.
The applicant asserted, but did not establish to my satisfaction, that his application to amend had come forward only because of late discovery or disclosure of material by the respondents.
He certainly did not establish that the application to amend could not have been made well before the commencement of the trial.
In the circumstances, I did not think that it was appropriate to allow the amendments and I refused leave to amend.
In those circumstances I did not need to consider some of the other grounds advanced (but not developed) by the respondents in opposing the application for leave to amend.
Those grounds included an assertion that the proposed new causes of action were out of time and statute-barred and that some of the proposed new claims were unarguable as a matter of law.
The facts 
 
16 The applicant gave evidence.
The bulk of his evidence-in-chief was given by way of affidavit and he was cross-examined by counsel for the respondents.
He was in 1997 and remains obsessed by what he perceives to be the injustice involved in the way in which he was treated by the ATO, officers of the ATO and others.
He tended to focus on matters which were not directly relevant to the issues in the proceeding.
He is convinced that there was a conspiracy against him led by the third respondent.
A good deal of his evidence was irrelevant to the issues raised in this proceeding and other "evidence" in his affidavits was in reality submissions about why I should find that the third respondent was motivated by improper considerations.
I approach the applicant's evidence with considerable caution and I accept the evidence of the respondents where there is a conflict.
For reasons I will give, I reject the applicant's evidence that he was given an access privilege to the ATO computer system in May 1997.
Further, some of the evidence he gave directed to establishing possible innocent explanations for certain system violations was confusing, but even if accepted, did not rise anywhere near a level sufficient to establish an error of the type identified in s 5 of the ADJR Act .
17 In reaching these conclusions I have had regard to all the evidence in the case including the documentary evidence and I have borne in mind that before me the applicant was not legally represented.
18 The applicant called Ms Erin Holland as a witness.
She is a Commonwealth public servant who is employed in the ATO.
She appeared under subpoena.
She was an honest and straightforward witness and I accept her evidence.
However, for reasons I will give, her evidence does not assist me in resolving the issues in the proceeding
 
19 The respondents each gave evidence.
The bulk of their evidence was contained in affidavits each of them had sworn.
Each respondent was cross-examined at some length by the applicant.
Each respondent was an honest and straightforward witness and I accept the evidence they gave.
The respondents called Mr John Molineux and Mr David Pasch as witnesses.
Mr Molineux is a Commonwealth public servant who is employed in the ATO.
He took notes of an important meeting held on 4 June 1997 and involving the applicant, the first respondent and the third respondent.
He was an honest and straightforward witness and I accept his evidence.
Mr Pasch is what is called an AP compliance officer and he is employed by IBM Australia and New Zealand.
At the request of the third respondent he prepared a report dated 12 June 1997 about a number of apparent system violations of the ATO's mainframe computer by the applicant during the period from January to May 1997.
He was an honest and straightforward witness and I accept his evidence.
20 The applicant made various challenges to the evidence called by the respondents.
Those challenges and my reasons for rejecting them, cannot be fully understood without first understanding the events surrounding the three decisions.
I will now set out in chronological order the events surrounding the three decisions.
The facts which follow are largely uncontentious but where there is a dispute I will indicate its nature.
21 It is convenient to start with a brief description of the ATO's computer system.
The ATO has two different "computer environments".
They were described by the third respondent and later by the second respondent as the mainframe environment and the TAXLAN environment.
The ATO's two mainframes are production and development, respectively, and they are primarily used for the storage and "manipulation" of taxpayer data.
They are also used to store and process the personnel records of ATO staff, including salary and leave details.
These particular records are stored in a database known as the National Organisational Management Database (NOMAD).
A database is a computer file which stores records which can be searched, sorted and updated by those persons who have appropriately authorised access to the database.
The NOMAD database is run on the production mainframe.
Every staff member of the ATO has access to their own salary and leave records in NOMAD, but they do not have access to the records of other staff.
The only persons who have access to the records of other staff are those responsible for personnel administration.
The applicant was not responsible for personnel administration.
22 The ATO's mainframe environment was run on IBM software and that included what the witnesses called the "RACF" software.
The RACF software controlled a person's level of access to the mainframe system.
A person's RACF profile was created by a system security administrator and it defined the person's authorisations in a mainframe environment.
A person may have no authorisation or a "read-only" authorisation or an "update" authorisation.
An unauthorised attempt to read or update data on the mainframe was recorded and was referred to as a system violation.
23 The TAXLAN environment is separate from the mainframe environment.
It contains the ATO's word processing, spreadsheet and electronic mail software.
It is possible to have access from any individual terminal to either the mainframe or TAXLAN environment.
24 The third respondent joined the Commonwealth public service in 1968 and he has considerable experience working in the development and use of computers, including training of staff, database development, quality assurance and applications development and support.
He has also been involved in writing computer programs.
From 1986 to 1997, he was Assistant Commissioner in the IT Services Line of the ATO.
His branch consisted of 700 staff members employed on a national level.
25 The applicant was a Commonwealth public servant employed within the IT services group of the ATO, between 1987 and December 1995.
The applicant was absent from work due to illness from 2 January 1996 to 15 December 1996.
He returned to work in December 1996 and from that time to about 5 May 1997 he was under the direct supervision of the third respondent.
His position was that of a senior information technology officer grade B.
26 When the applicant returned to work in December 1996 the third respondent was mindful of giving him such work as would give him the best opportunity to reintegrate into the workforce.
The applicant was given a number of projects between his return to work in December 1996 and the date of his suspension from duty (that is, on 4 June 1997).
The first was referred to as the "business resumption planning project" ("BRP project").
The third respondent considered that it would take the applicant two to three months to complete the BRP project.
He considered that all the resources the applicant would need for the project were available in the TAXLAN environment, save perhaps for internet access for personal research for which the applicant never asked.
He did not consider that the applicant would need access to the mainframe computers.
He said that all the applicant was required to do was to carry out research and prepare a paper.
The research could be done by discussion with others and reading books.
By about mid-March 1997, the third respondent became concerned about the time it was taking the applicant to complete the project and by the extent to which he appeared to be accessing the ATO mainframes.
27 The third respondent arranged a second project for the applicant to undertake after he had finished the BRP project.
The second project was referred to as the "applications development environment project" and the third respondent and the applicant discussed what it would involve in late March or early April 1997.
The third respondent asked the applicant to prepare a document setting out the proposed terms of reference for the project.
However, in late April or early May 1997, the third respondent became aware that the applicant had commenced legal proceedings against three Commonwealth public servants who worked within the ATO.
The third respondent discussed this action with the applicant on 2 May 1997 and then on 6 May 1997, he decided that he could not allow the applicant to proceed with the applications development environment project because that project would involve the applicant working in close proximity to people he was pursuing by way of legal proceedings.
The applicant sought from the third respondent written reasons for his decision, apparently under s 13 of the ADJR Act and, on 7 May 1997, the third respondent provided written reasons for his decision to the applicant.
28 The third and final project discussed by the third respondent and the applicant was referred to as the "single sign-on project".
That project was discussed between them on or about 8 or 9 May 1997.
The third respondent asked Mr Geoff Best to supervise the applicant during the period in which he was carrying out the project, and the applicant commenced working on the project on or around the dates it was discussed.
29 As I have said, the third respondent had become concerned about the applicant's usage of the mainframes and he asked Mr Best "to keep an eye" on the applicant's mainframe access.
The third respondent said that on or around 6 or 7 May 1997, he received information from Mr Best that caused him to carry out further investigations into the applicant's mainframe usage.
It is likely it was a little later than this bearing in mind the timing of the events referred to in the previous paragraph.
Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the relevant events happened and that the steps the third respondent then took may be summarised in point form as follows:
 
 1.
On 7 or 8 May 1997 he asked Mr Graham Littlejohn, who was a computer specialist working under Mr Best, to perform an audit of the mainframe logs to check the applicant's usage.
2.
At about the same time, he spoke to the first respondent about the ATO's options if the applicant had been making unauthorised use of its mainframes.
3.
Within two to four days, Mr Littlejohn gave the third respondent material showing a number of system violations by the applicant.
4.
