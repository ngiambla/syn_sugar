 This is a proceeding commenced in the Court by Application and a Statement of Claim filed on 25 July 2005, wherein the applicant claims that the respondents have infringed Patent 774224 A barrier (the Patent), which was registered by the applicant as patentee under the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the Act) on 10 August 2000, and having priority from 10 August 1999.
The Patent is for a term of 20 years.
The applicant's Patent "relates to a barrier", primarily for application as a traffic barrier.
The function of a traffic barrier, the evidence shows, is to redirect or arrest an errant vehicle safely and prevent the errant vehicle from passing through it.
The purpose for doing so may be to protect the occupants of the vehicle from colliding with a roadside or other hazard or may separately or also be to prevent the errant vehicle from colliding with people working or otherwise positioned in the area behind the traffic barrier.
The applicant also seeks relief under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TP Act) for an alleged breach by the first and second respondents of s 52 of the TP Act.
In its Amended Application, filed 3 April 2006, the applicant seeks the following relief: A declaration that the Respondents have infringed Australian Patent 774224 A barrier (the Patent).

 An order that the Respondents, whether by themselves, their servants or agents, be restrained from during the term of the Patent, and any extension of it, without the licence of the Applicant, importing, manufacturing, selling, hiring or offering to sell or hire the Guardliner road safety barrier system described in the Statement of Claim (the "infringing system").

 Damages for infringement of the Patent or, at the Applicant's election, an account of profits.

 All necessary enquiries into such damages or an account of profits.

 Delivery up to the Applicant's Solicitors or, alternatively, destruction on oath of:- 
 
 
 (a) all of the components of the infringing system in the possession, custody or power of the Respondents or either of them.

 

 
 
 (b) all brochures, flyers, catalogues, price lists and other materials promoting or marketing for sale or hire the infringing system.

 

 A declaration that the conduct of the First Respondent in publishing the Guardliner advertisements in the June/July 2005 edition of ROADS magazine contravened Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act .

 An order that the First Respondent, whether by itself, its servants or agents, be restrained from representing that the Guardliner road safety barrier system is the subject of any pending patent application.

 An order that the First Respondent issue a public announcement to the effect that the Guardliner road safety barrier is not the subject of any pending patent application and publish corrective advertising to the same effect, such announcement and advertising to be in the form and manner directed by the Court.

 Damages pursuant to Section 82 of the Trade Practices Act .

 Interest under Section 51A of the Federal Court Act 1976.

 Costs.

 Such further or other orders as the court thinks fit.

 The first and second respondent, in the Further Amended Defence and Cross-Claim, filed 24 August 2006, cross-claim against the applicant (cross-respondent) for: A declaration that the Patent is and has been at all material times invalid.

 An order that the Patent and each and all of the claims of the complete specification thereof be wholly revoked.

 Costs.

 Such further or other orders as the Court sees fit.

 The applicant is a corporation incorporated in Australia and the Patent in question identifies an invention, described in claim 1 of the Patent as: 
 
 1.
... a barrier system including: 
 a plurality of hollow, ballast-fillable, demountable barrier elements that are arranged end to end so as to form a barrier, each of said barrier elements having opposing side walls and opposing end portions, said end portions being adapted to combine with an opposing end portion of an adjacent barrier element to form a joint connecting adjacent barrier elements together, and 
 at least one thin walled, longitudinally extending, guard member that is mounted on and overlies the side walls of at least two adjacent barrier elements.

 (Emphasis added) 
 

 The specification of the applicant's patent acknowledges that: 
 
 Demountable traffic barriers typically include a plurality of hollow, water fillable, barrier elements which are arranged end to end and are linked by a plurality of pin joints or by interlocking end portions.

 

 The specification continues: 
 
 Often the connection means connecting adjacent barrier elements and/or the side walls of individual barrier elements are damaged by collisions with motor vehicles.
The resulting damage often severely weakens the structural integrity of the barrier.

 

 The specification speaks of disadvantages of damaged barrier elements, and then says: 
 
 The present invention aims to alleviate at least one of the above disadvantages and to provide a barrier which will be reliable and efficient in use.
Other advantages of this invention will hereinafter become apparent.

 

 The specification says that: " With the foregoing and other objects in view, this invention resides broadly in a barrier system including " barrier elements as described and " at least one thin walled, longitudinally extending, guard member that is mounted on and overlies the side walls of at least two adjacent barrier elements .
The specification later says: 
 
 The profile of at least one side wall of the barrier element, in some embodiments, may be arranged to complement or receive the guard which may , when assembled, bear against same.

 (Emphasis added).

 

 This sentence in the specification has a relevance in relation to the meaning to be given to phrase "mounted on" in Claim 1 of the Patent.
Later, the specification says: 
 
 The longitudinally extending guard overlies two or more of the barrier elements.
Advantageously, providing a guard which overlies a plurality of adjacent barrier elements serves to increase the stability of the barrier system and render it less deformable when subjected to minor impact.

 

 Figure 1 referred to in the specification is " a pictorial view of a barrier constructed in accordance with the present invention ", and " illustrate(s) a preferred embodiment of the invention ".
In the description of Figure 1, the specification says: 
 
 The barrier 10 also includes a number of guards 17 manufactured from a thin walled, rolled section, of galvanised steel.
The guards 17 are arranged end to end and are secured to the barrier elements by threaded fasteners 18.
Individual guards are positioned such that they overlie the connection between adjacent barrier elements 11.

 

 
 
 In use, the guards 17 protect the barrier elements 11 from direct contact with a motor vehicle and help strengthen the connection between adjacent barrier elements.

 

 The specification thus asserts that the invention inhibits or avoids damage to the barrier elements, and enhances the function of a barrier by producing a stronger longitudinal barrier.
The first respondent is a corporation incorporated in Australia, which has manufactured and offered for sale the Guardliner traffic barrier system.
The second respondent admits that he was responsible for the placing of advertisements, in the magazine "ROADS" at pages 37 and 38 of the December 2004/January 2005 edition, entitled "Guardliner Series --- relocatable guardrail road barrier system --- by Barron  Rawson Pty Ltd", and at page 29 of the June/July 2005 edition.
