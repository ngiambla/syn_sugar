 
1 Before the Court are two notices of motion filed by the respondents, one filed in each of two proceedings brought by the applicant.
The respondents primarily seek to have the proceedings dismissed or the pleadings struck out.
2 The applicant was formerly employed by the Australian Federal Police.
In around July 2004, an internal investigation was commenced into certain complaints made against the applicant.
The applicant's employment was ultimately terminated in December 2005.
The proceedings brought by the applicant broadly concern this termination and the surrounding events.
The applicant has filed an application for an order of review and a statement of claim in both proceedings, as well as a number of subsequent versions of these documents.
Numerous causes of action are potentially raised.
3 The matter is complicated by the fact that the applicant is now a bankrupt.
It is necessary to consider which if any of the causes of action the applicant maintains can continue in his name, pursuant to s 60(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).
History of the proceedings 
 
4 There are two relevant proceedings before this Court, one of which was transferred from the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory.
The Supreme Court proceedings were commenced on 14 December 2005, by application for an order of review.
That application invokes the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 (ACT) ("ADJR Act (ACT)") although other legislation is also referred to, including the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT).
Statements of claim were later filed, the first of which was on 5 June 2006, apparently in response to an order of a judge of the Supreme Court of 4 May 2006.
On 1 December 2006, an order was made transferring the proceedings to this Court pursuant to s 5(1)(b)(i) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross Vesting) Act 1993 (ACT).
Those proceedings are ACD 35 of 2006.
It is unnecessary to address in these reasons, whether the proceedings should have been transferred, though I presently doubt that they should have.
5 On 4 July 2006, when the Supreme Court proceedings had not yet been transferred, the applicant commenced proceedings in this Court, again by way of an application for an order of review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("ADJR Act") (ACD 17 of 2006).
Filed together with the application was an affidavit of the applicant in which he apparently seeks to explain the delay in filing the proceedings in this Court (which is in terms of having first brought proceedings in the Supreme Court).
It appears that the applicant would require an extension of time to file the application for an order of review in this Court, being outside the 28 day time limit: see s 11(3) of the ADJR Act .
The respondents do not oppose any application for an extension of time.
6 The application primarily invokes the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("ADJR Act"), although again various other legislation is also referred to, including the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) and the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("WRA").
A draft statement of claim was filed on 11 August 2006, in response to a direction of Gyles J.
7 As noted earlier, the applicant has filed various amended versions of the application for an order of review and the statement of claim in each proceeding.
He has also sworn numerous affidavits in the proceedings.
The applicant has said that he seeks to rely upon all the documents he has filed to date, including all the pleadings, not merely the most recent versions.
The pleadings in particular are discursive and largely in the form of submissions.
They tend to be repetitive and difficult to follow.
A number of orders have been made by this Court in an attempt to provide the applicant with an opportunity to better, more concisely and precisely articulate his case, as well as to ensure that the respondents are properly informed of the case to be met.
Orders were also made by the Supreme Court apparently with the same purpose in mind.
The respondents have also been directed to take a number of steps in order to assist the applicant in reformulating his case and to inform the applicant of the respondents' objections to the pleadings he has filed and to provide him with an opportunity to reformulate his case accordingly, should he wish.
Unfortunately, despite these measures, the applicant's case is little clearer as a result.
A summary of the relevant orders of this Court is as follows.
8 On 20 July 2006, at the first directions hearing, Emmett J directed the applicant to file and serve a statement setting out each decision in respect of which the applicant sought judicial review under the ADJR Act , the person who made that decision and the date on which it was made, the enactment under which the decision was made and the grounds in s 5 of the ADJR Act upon which he sought review.
The applicant was also directed to file a draft statement of claim which he sought leave to file.
The applicant filed the relevant documents in August 2006.
Both the statement and the draft statement of claim are lengthy documents (31 pages and 28 pages respectively) and are generally in the form of submissions.
The statement is in very similar terms to the application for an order of review, although it contains some additional references to legislation.
In the statement, the applicant has attempted to identify the grounds and the relevant enactments.
However, the grounds of the ADJR Act identified include every ground under ss 5 and 6 of the ADJR Act .
The enactments he identifies as being those under which the "decisions" were made are numerous sections of several different Acts, including the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the WRA and the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).
The document is not readily comprehensible and did not clarify the applicant's case.
The draft statement of claim is also difficult to follow.
It is similar in content to the application for an order of review and refers to various legislation.
It is by no means clear from that document which causes of action the applicant seeks to raise.
9 On 31 August 2006, when the matter was heard for directions by Gyles J, the respondents were directed to write to the applicant advising him of the defects in his statement of claim and application.
The applicant was directed to serve an amended statement of claim and amended application for review in response or to advise that he did not intend to do so.
His Honour also directed the respondents to either file a notice of motion to object to competency or seeking orders for summary dismissal or strike out, or advise that they did not intend to do so.
10 The respondents' solicitors duly wrote to the applicant by letter dated 14 September 2006, setting out in some detail the various legal difficulties with the applicant's case to assist him to reformulate his claims.
The letter is annexed to an affidavit of the respondents' solicitor, Karina Harvey, sworn 21 June 2007.
11 On 25 September 2006, the applicant filed a number of documents.
These included an amended application for order of review and an amended statement of claim.
In the amended statement of claim, the applicant said that it had not been possible at that time to re-submit a complete version of that document.
The applicant also filed an affidavit in which he apparently seeks to explain why he had been unable to file a "complete" document, referring to the lack of legal representation and matters of general background.
12 The matter came before me on 7 November 2006.
I directed the applicant to file and serve an amended application for order of review and an amended statement of claim.
A direction was also made regarding the respondents in the terms of the directions made by Gyles J on 31 August 2006.
13 The applicant proceeded to file the documents the subject of the direction, as well as another "statement".
None of these documents provide any further real assistance, nor are they any more succinct.
14 Both proceedings came before me for directions on 15 December 2006, the transfer order having been made by that stage.
The applicant was directed to file all his evidence, in the form of affidavits, on which he intended to rely.
This direction was made before the respondents were required to file their response to the pleadings with a view to enabling the applicant to put his case as best he could and to hopefully allow the respondents to distil the causes of action relied upon the applicant and inform them of the case to be met.
15 In response, the applicant filed an affidavit of some 58 pages in length.
It is similar in terms to the documents previously filed although contains further detail in some respects.
Again, it is generally in the form of submissions and allegations.
16 On 8 March 2007, when the proceedings were again before me for directions, I directed the respondents to write to the applicant identifying what in their understanding were the decisions which the applicant sought to challenge under the ADJR Act .
The applicant was directed to respond by indicating which if any of those decisions he sought to impugn.
The respondents were directed to then file any notice of motion challenging the contention that such decisions were reviewable.
17 In accordance with the direction, the respondents' solicitors wrote to the applicant by letter dated 28 March 2007, setting out in detail the decisions which it apprehended the applicant was seeking to challenge and including references to the relevant documents filed by the applicant.
That letter was also annexed to the affidavit of Ms Harvey sworn 21 June 2007.
18 On 10 April 2007, the applicant filed a statement in response to the letter received by the respondents' solicitors.
The applicant took issue with the fact that the letter had apparently only sought to include those "decisions" which the applicant had identified in his most recently filed application for an order of review.
The applicant asserted that all the evidence in his affidavit of 19 February 2007 (which was at that date the most recently of the applicant's affidavits) "is capable of being the subject of a judicial review".
19 The respondents' notices of motion were then filed on 3 May 2007.
Summary of causes of action 
 
20 As noted earlier, both proceedings were commenced by way an application for an order of review.
Statements of claim and "amended" versions were subsequently filed.
In total in both proceedings combined, there are six applications for an order of review and five statements of claim.
21 The applications for an order of review in both proceedings may be considered together for present purposes.
It is evident from the applications for an order of review, as well as his written and oral submissions, that the applicant seeks judicial review of a series of events leading up to and surrounding his termination.
The applicant seeks to characterise every aspect of the process as an "administrative decision" of which review is sought.
Many of these do not appear to be in the nature of decisions, even using that term in a non-technical sense.
