 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 In July 2004, Advance Health Care Properties Pty Ltd ("Advance") contracted to purchase land and the business known as "Victoria by the Park" located at 27 Victoria Street, Elsternwick ("Victoria by the Park") from PrimeLife Corporation Limited, PrimeLife Management Services Pty Ltd (collectively "PrimeLife") and Victoria Gardens Syndication Pty Ltd.
The investment failed.
The repercussions of that failed investment are far-reaching and extend beyond the borrower and providers of security to the financier, Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac"), and Westpac's legal advisers, Gadens Lawyers ("Gadens").
2 Before turning to consider the extent of those repercussions, it is necessary to say something about the conduct of the parties and the role of the Court.
In the course of the trial each party sought to level criticisms at the conduct of, and choices made by, the other participants in the events.
The task of the Court is not, however, to attempt to apportion moral blame or responsibility.
Rather, the role of the Court is to piece together what was said and done and determine where legal liability for that conduct and those choices should fall.
3 Westpac, the Respondent and Cross-Claimant in the first cross-claim in these proceedings, provided finance to Advance to assist with its purchase of Victoria by the Park.
Westpac also provided finance to the First Applicant, Middleton Nominees Pty Ltd ("Middleton Nominees"), to assist with payment of the deposit and to provide working capital for other purposes.
In addition, Westpac provided the Third Cross-Respondent in the first cross-claim Ms Kirsch (the sole director of Advance), with a business cheque account ("the Kirsch cheque account").
The Advance and Middleton Nominees credit facilities ("the Facilities") were secured, amongst other things, by mortgages and guarantees and indemnities from related entities and individuals.
There is no dispute that certain amounts advanced under the Facilities have not been repaid to Westpac.
4 This proceeding was brought by Middleton Nominees and two others (the Second Applicant, Mrs Sonia Kirszbaum and the Third Applicant, Nepalle Pty Ltd) under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the "TPA") to challenge Westpac's entitlement to look to them to assist in repayment of the amounts advanced and unpaid.
Unsurprisingly, Westpac disputed the Applicants' claims and filed a cross-claim seeking judgment for the amounts owing under the Facilities, judgment for the amount owing under the Kirsch cheque account and judgment for possession of the mortgaged properties provided as security for the Facilities.
Westpac also cross-claimed against Gadens, which admitted the advice they provided to Westpac in connection with the Facilities was negligent.
Gadens subsequently filed a cross-claim against a Westpac officer (the Cross-Respondent in the second cross-claim, Mr Geoffrey Schmidt) who was involved in discussions with Mrs Kirszbaum and her daughter Ms Kirsch about Westpac's financing of the Advance investment.
The Fourth Cross-Respondent in the first cross-claim, Mr Boris Volkov, husband of Ms Kirsch, in turn cross-claimed against Westpac, alleging that Westpac was not entitled to look to him for repayment of amounts owed by Advance.
5 These reasons for decision are structured as follows:
 
I Westpac's debt claims
 
II Applicants' and Mr Volkov's Grounds for Non-Recoverability by Westpac
 
 
 (a) Alleged Expiry of the Middleton Nominees Guarantee
 (b) Nepalle Restitution Claim
 (c) Volkov Guarantee Claim
 (d) Kirszbaum Guarantee Claim 
 

III Apportionment Issues
 
IV Conclusion
 I WESTPAC'S DEBT CLAIMS 
 
6 The circumstances giving rise to Westpac's debt claims are straightforward.
Advance 
 
7 Advance executed a heads of agreement for the sale and purchase of Victoria by the Park on 29 July 2004.
The purchase price was $13,750,000.
The purchase was funded by a commercial bill line facility from Westpac to Advance in the amount of $12.1m.
Westpac also provided an overdraft to Advance.
Advance's commercial bill line of $12.1m was secured by:
 
 
 (1) a registered first-ranking mortgage given by Advance over Victoria by the Park and a registered and exclusive debenture granted by Advance over all its assets and uncalled capital.
(These securities may be put to one side.
Westpac appointed a receiver to Advance who sold Victoria by the Park);
 (2) a guarantee and indemnity from Middleton Nominees in its own right and as trustee for the Kirszbaum Family Trust ("the Middleton Nominees Guarantee") supported by: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a registered first and exclusive debenture granted by Middleton Nominees in its own right and as trustee for the Kirszbaum Family Trust over all its assets and uncalled capital; and 
 (b) mortgages over properties owned by Middleton Nominees in its own right and as trustee for the Kirszbaum Family Trust, namely 148, 253 and 350 Lygon Street, Carlton, Victoria; 
 
 
 
 
 (3) a guarantee and indemnity from Nepalle, limited to the value of a property at 44 Otira Road, Caulfield and supported by a first registered mortgage over that property ("the Nepalle Guarantee");
 (4) a guarantee and indemnity from Mr Volkov, limited to the value of the family home of Mr Volkov at 51 Lumeah Road, Caulfield (the "Lumeah Road property") and supported by a first registered and exclusive mortgage (the "Volkov mortgage") over the Lumeah Road property ("the Volkov Guarantee"); and
 (5) a guarantee and indemnity from Ms Kirsch limited to $12,100,000 together with interest and costs and a further 20% to cover any excesses ("the Kirsch Guarantee").

 
 Middleton Nominees 
 
8 Westpac provided four commercial bill facilities to Middleton Nominees pursuant to a business finance agreement dated 21 July 2005 ("the Middleton Nominees Facilities"), namely:
 
 
 (1) Facility "B", with a limit of $2,322,500, which was the continuation of an existing facility;
 (2) Facility "C", with a limit of $737,500, which was the continuation of an existing facility and which provided the funds necessary for Advance to pay the deposit to Primelife;
 (3) Facility "D", with a limit of $490,000, a new facility to assist in the purchase of an apartment in Toorak for Leonard Volkov, Ms Kirsch's son;
 (4) Facility "E", with a limit of $200,000, a new facility for working capital and Mrs Kirszbaum's ongoing living expenses.

 

Westpac had also previously provided a cheque account to Middleton Nominees on 7 June 1995.
9 The Middleton Nominees Facilities were secured by:
 
 
 (1) a fixed and floating charge given by Middleton Nominees in its own capacity and as trustee for the Kirszbaum Family Trust over all its assets and uncalled capital and registered on 6 July 1995;
 (2) mortgages given by Middleton Nominees over 148, 253 and 350 Lygon Street, Carlton and a property at 3/522 Toorak Road, Toorak;
 (3) a guarantee and indemnity provided by Mrs Kirszbaum in relation to all money which Middleton Nominees might owe Westpac as of 6 June 1995 or at any other time ("the 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee"); and supported by mortgages given by Mrs Kirszbaum over 255, 257, 344, 346 and 348 Lygon Street, Carlton.

 
 Kirsch 
 
10 Finally, as noted above, Westpac provided Ms Kirsch with a business cheque account.
Summary 
 
11 The amounts advanced by Westpac to Middleton Nominees, Advance and Ms Kirsch are not in dispute.
Similarly, the amount of the debts and the securities provided to support those amounts, and the amounts realised by Westpac under securities that have been enforced, are not in dispute.
There is no dispute that Westpac served demands for repayment of the amounts outstanding under the Facilities and that, as at 28 November 2007, the amounts owing were:
 Middleton Nominees Account Account No Amount Rate Commercial bills 033000-584633 $4,048,134.79 14.50% Cheque account 033165-502891 $263,759.39 18.70% $4,311,894.18 Advance $4,995,114.12 14.50% Ms Kirsch $58,105.83 Indicator lending rate plus a margin of 4%.

 
12 Accordingly, Westpac seeks: 
 
 
 (1) judgment against Middleton Nominees and Mrs Kirszbaum for amounts owing under facilities provided to Middleton Nominees;
 (2) judgment against Middleton Nominees (and by default, Mrs Kirszbaum) and Ms Kirsch for amounts owing under facilities provided to Advance;
 (3) judgment against Ms Kirsch for amounts owing under the business cheque account;
 (4) judgment for possession of the mortgaged properties of Middleton Nominees listed in para [9(2)] above and Mr Volkov listed in para [7(4)] above, as security for the facilities provided to and liabilities of Advance; and
 (5) judgment for possession of the mortgaged properties of Mrs Kirszbaum listed in para [9(3)] above, as security for the facilities provided to and liabilities of Middleton Nominees.

 

13 The Applicants and Mr Volkov dispute that Westpac is entitled to orders in these or similar terms.
They submit that Westpac is not entitled to recover the outstanding debts or to enforce the various securities to which those outstanding debts relate.
Accordingly, it becomes necessary to consider each of the grounds upon which the Applicants and Mr Volkov contend that Westpac is not entitled to those orders.
II APPLICANTS' AND MR VOLKOV'S GROUNDS FOR NON RECOVERABILITY BY WESTPAC 
 
14 The challenge to Westpac's entitlement to enforce its debt claims extends to Middleton Nominees, Nepalle, Mr Volkov and Mrs Kirszbaum.
Each of these claims is considered separately under the following headings:
 
(a) Alleged Expiry of Middleton Nominees Guarantee;
 
(b) Nepalle Restitution Claim;
 
(c) Volkov Guarantee Claim; and
 
(d) 1995 Kirszbaum Guarantee Claim.
Two points should be made at the outset.
First, in final address counsel for the Applicants and Mr Volkov abandoned several other ways of putting the case which, until that point, had been pursued during the trial.
Secondly, the chief weight of the arguments for the parties as finally formulated was placed upon what was alleged to have been said in two conversations: (1) a conversation on 24 June 2005 which undoubtedly did take place between Mrs Kirszbaum, Ms Kirsch and Mr Schmidt at Westpac premises in Mt Waverley when documents were signed; and (2) a conversation said to have taken place between Ms Kirsch, Mr Volkov and Mr Schmidt at the home of Ms Kirsch and Mr Volkov before Mr Volkov signed documents.
(a) Alleged Expiry of Middleton Nominees Guarantee 
 
15 As noted earlier (see [7] above), on 4 July 2005 Westpac provided Advance with a commercial bill line facility of $12.1m.
A Business Finance Agreement dated 24 June 2005 between Advance and Westpac ("the Advance BFA") set out the terms of that facility.
The Advance BFA provided that the facility was for 6 months, expiring on 31 December 2005.
No repayment was made on or before this date.
Middleton Nominees gave the Middleton Nominees Guarantee as security for this facility (see [7(2)] above).
It was an "all-moneys" guarantee in respect of money now or in the future owed by Advance to Westpac.
The guarantee expressly provided that " there is no limit on the amount to be paid under this document ".
As noted earlier (par [7(2)] above), security for the guarantee was in the form of a debenture and mortgages over properties owned by Middleton Nominees at 148, 253 and 350 Lygon Street, Carlton, Victoria.
The guarantee was in counterparts.
Each counterpart was executed by Mrs Kirszbaum and her son, Louis Kirszbaum, the directors of Middleton Nominees.
16 The Applicants contend that the Middleton Nominees Guarantee expired on 31 December 2005 and that, as a result, Middleton Nominees' liability under that guarantee is at an end.
For the reasons that follow, I reject that claim.
17 To understand the allegation that the Middleton Nominees Guarantee expired on 31 December 2005, it is necessary to understand the form of the document signed by Mrs Kirszbaum and her son.
Each counterpart comprises a four-page document entitled "Guarantee and Indemnity" which was executed by Mrs Kirszbaum and her son.
At the back is a further two-page document entitled "Form of Acknowledgment --- Business Guarantor" executed by Mrs Kirzsbaum.
Each copy of the Acknowledgment contained a handwritten annotation in black ink written by Ms Kirsch which reads " Expires 12/2005 as per WBC agreement " ("Expiry Term").
18 The Applicants contend that the Middleton Nominees Guarantee expired on 31 December 2005 on four alternative bases:
 
 (1) as a matter of contract, the guarantee contained the Expiry Term;
 
 (2) there was no consensus on the essential terms of the guarantee;
 
 (3) unilateral mistake;
 
 
 (4) Westpac and Mrs Kirszbaum made an oral agreement on 24 June 2005 that the guarantee would expire on 31 December 2005.

 

19 However, framing the relevant issue in these ways may distract attention from the first essential step, which is to identify what exactly happened and what the parties agreed.
Mrs Kirszbaum gave evidence which, at the risk of undue abbreviation, was to the effect that the written annotation " Expires 12/2005 as per WBC agreement " reflected an oral arrangement she and her daughter had struck with Mr Schmidt, a Westpac Bank Officer, on 24 June 2005.
20 For reasons which are developed later (see [26] ff), the evidence of Mrs Kirszbaum and her daughter, Ms Kirsch does not establish that there was a conversation to the effect alleged.
And because the evidence of oral communications to the effect recorded in the annotation is rejected, it follows that the agreement of guarantee between Westpac and Middleton Nominees is to be identified as contained in and constituted by the four-page written document entitled "Guarantee and Indemnity".
21 As noted above, the Middleton Nominees Guarantee was a printed form comprising four pages under the heading "Guarantee and Indemnity".
It identified the parties and contained the relevant terms.
The security was described as being " in respect of money now or in the future owed by" Advance as the recipient of the loan moneys.
The "Guaranteed Obligations" were identified as " all liabilities and obligations of [Advance] ... now or in the future" .
Attached to the back of the Middleton Nominee's Guarantee was the Form of Acknowledgment.
22 The Form of Acknowledgment attached to that document on which the critical handwritten annotation was made did not form part of the agreement of guarantee and indemnity between Westpac and Middleton Nominees.
The Form of Acknowledgment referred to, but did not contain or constitute, an agreement between the parties.
It was a document sought by Westpac as a record of statements made by Mrs Kirszbaum which Westpac could use if Mrs Kirszbaum were to later claim that she should not be held to be bound by the agreement because she did not understand it.
As the High Court pointed out in Wilson v Anderson [2002] HCA 29 ; (2002) 213 CLR 401.
418 [8] and Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 , 461-62 [22], it is the written terms of an agreement which speak to third parties.
This is particularly so in commercial contexts where the agreement is recorded in a deed or other similar document.
In the present case, it is the Guarantee and not the Form of Acknowledgment that records the terms of the bargain the parties made.
23 However, even if the Form of Acknowledgment did form part of the Middleton Nominees Guarantee agreement (a conclusion I reject), the agreement did not contain the Expiry Term.
For the reasons that are developed later (at [26] ff), I do not accept that Mrs Kirszbaum and Ms Kirsch had (as they swore) a conversation with Mr Schmidt of Westpac, on 24 June 2005, in which it was agreed that the Middleton Nominees Guarantee was for a limited term.
Because I reject that evidence, it is not established that Mrs Kirszbaum ever offered or sought a new term limiting the duration of the liability.
All I know from the evidence upon which I am prepared to act is that her daughter, Ms Kirsch, amended the Form of Acknowledgment after Mrs Kirszbaum had signed it and before Westpac provided money to Advance.
There is nothing revealed by the evidence upon which I am prepared to act that connected Mrs Kirszbaum to this annotation.
More particularly, there is nothing to show that Mrs Kirszbaum procured or even consented to the annotation or its contents.
24 To the extent that Mrs Kirszbaum now contends otherwise, her contention is founded entirely upon her having discussed the matter with Mr Schmidt at Westpac.
My rejection of her evidence of that conversation necessarily entails rejection of so much of the rest of her evidence as suggested that it was she who demanded the limitation on the term of the guarantee.
25 It is not possible to say whether Mrs Kirszbaum's evidence about the supposed conversation with Mr Schmidt was affected by or even dictated by a misplaced loyalty to her daughter manifesting itself in proffering an innocent explanation for what in truth was her daughter's unilateral act in annotating the Form of Acknowledgment after her mother had signed it.
But because I reject Mrs Kirszbaum's evidence about the conversation with Mr Schmidt and because I conclude that her daughter annotated the Form of Acknowledgment after her mother had signed it, it is not demonstrated that Mrs Kirszbaum executed either the Middleton Nominees Guarantee or the Form of Acknowledgment under any misapprehension as to the contents or effect of either document.
Meeting on 24 June 2005 
 
26 It is necessary to deal directly with the events of 24 June 2005.
Much of what transpired on 24 June 2005 is not in dispute.
There was a meeting held at the Mt Waverley, South East Business Banking Offices of Westpac on that day.
The meeting was attended by Mrs Kirszbaum, Ms Kirsch and Mr Schmidt.
At the meeting a number of documents relating to the Facilities were executed by Mrs Kirszbaum and Ms Kirsch.
A deal of other evidence was given about the meeting including evidence about particular details of time and other circumstances.
It is not necessary to consider those matters in detail.
27 What is in dispute is whether the handwritten annotation to Question 6 on the Form of Acknowledgment (ie addition of the Expiry Term) was made by Ms Kirsch during the 24 June 2005 meeting and, if so, whether it was at the direction of and with the knowledge of Mr Schmidt as agent for Westpac.
There is further disagreement about whether, at the end of the meeting, the pile of documents executed by Mrs Kirszbaum was retained by Mr Schmidt or was taken away by Ms Kirsch and returned to Westpac at a later date but before drawdown of the settlement moneys on 4 July 2005.
28 Before considering the different versions of what transpired at the meeting, it is necessary to say something of Mr Schmidt's position in relation to the Facilities and his previous involvement with Mrs Kirszbaum.
Since 1995, Mr Schmidt had been the Senior Relationship Manager for the business banking affairs of Mrs Kirszbaum and Middleton Nominees.
That role continued until the recovery of debts from Middleton Nominees became Westpac's primary concern in 2006.
Mr Schmidt described Mrs Kirszbaum as a shrewd business woman with whom he had irregular personal contact over a number of years.
Mr Schmidt recalled meeting her approximately 12 times over a period of 9 years.
However, Mr Schmidt was not the bank officer responsible for negotiating the final form of the Advance BFA.
Mr Tim Keating, a Senior Business Development Manager in Westpac's Business Acquisition Group, undertook that role following the handover of the Advance business to him in early November 2004.
29 There is no detailed contemporaneous note about what transpired at the 24 June 2005 meeting.
The notes that do exist are of limited assistance.
Mr Schmidt's work calendar for the week ending 24 June 2005 confirms a meeting between Mr Schmidt and Lola Kirsch on 24 June 2005 described as Docs signing .
