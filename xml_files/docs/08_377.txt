 
1 This case concerns the financial consequences of a failed investment in what was known as the Queen Victoria Project.
The first plaintiff, John Tosich, was the investor.
Tosich was a client of the first defendant, Tasman Investment Management Limited, formerly Warne Investment Management Limited, ("Tasman Investment") that carried on business as a financial planner.
The second defendant, Colin Warne, was managing director of Tasman Investment and was personally involved in its dealings with Tosich.
Warne recommended the investment in the Queen Victoria Project to Tosich.
It was a failure.
Tosich sues Tasman Investment and Warne for his loss.
All Saints Investments Pty Limited ("All Saints") claims to be an assignee of Tosich's cause of action against Tasman Investment and Warne.
American Home Assurance Company ("AIG") is an insurer and issued an Investment Managers Insurance Policy 85550 that Tasman Investment and Warne claim will indemnify them in relation to claims arising out of the failure of the Queen Victoria Project.
Aon Risk Services Australia Limited ("Aon") was an insurance broker and acted as such for Tasman Investment.
If the AIG policy does not provide cover, then the defendants sue Aon.
These relationships have given rise to a plethora of claims and cross-claims that need to be examined with some care.
The parties have agreed on a chronology of events that fleshes out the issues to be determined.
In order to better match issues with events I have edited and split the chronology under the following headings: history related to Warne entities; Queen Victoria Project; dealings between Tosich and Warne; dealings between Warne entities and Aon; dealings between Aon and AIG; and dealings between Warne entities and AIG.
The split is somewhat arbitrary and there is some overlap.
The chronology so organised is the first schedule to this judgment.
The second schedule is a dramatis personae.
2 The fundamental transaction was the purchase of a site of some 404 ha at Tableland Road, Wentworth Falls in the New South Wales Blue Mountains area, the registered proprietor of which was the Wentworth Area Health Service, a branch of the New South Wales Health Department.
It was the site of the former Queen Victoria Hospital.
The site was zoned part Bushland Conservation (No Subdivision) (Hospital), part Bushland Conservation (No Subdivision) and part Environmental Protection under the City of Blue Mountains LEP 1991.
Longevity Management Systems Pty Ltd (LMS) was interested in acquiring the site to develop a retirement village.
The project was introduced to Warne.
3 On 10 May 2000 Tasman Investment (by Warne) provided LMS with a written commitment to provide the funds required for acquisition of the property by 28 June 2000 based on a bid price of $1.52 million.
That letter was provided to the Department of Public Works --- Services, which was handling the sale on behalf of the vendor, with the bid by LMS.
A further offer of $2,012,000 was made on 25 May 2000 and accepted on 29 May 2000 with settlement on or before 28 June 2000.
Settlement occurred on 27 June 2000.
Tasman Investment provided the funds and LMS took title.
4 So, the defendants were committed to the project on 3 June 2000 when Tosich received a letter from Warne on behalf of Tasman Investment as follows:
 
 "It is not everyday I have the opportunity to offer you a Residential Property Development Investment , to build a Retirement Village at Wentworth Falls (Blue Mountains).

 
 We have been researching this type of Property Development for some time and we believe it could generate returns of approximately 20% pa over a 5 year period .

 
 Full details of the project are enclosed.
Please read it and arrange an appointment with Sandra, Laurie or Peter to discuss the suitability of this investment.

 
 A seminar will be held on Wednesday 14 th June 2000, details enclosed.

 
 I will be in Canada from Friday 2 nd June returning Tuesday 27 th June.
