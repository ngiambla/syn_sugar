 Extension of Protective Orders 
 
1 The orders I made when these proceedings commenced were made on 20 April 2006 under the provisions of section 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth): Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Carey (No 3) (2006) 232 ALR 577.
That section conditions the Court's power to make orders affecting the ability of a person or company to deal with their own assets where one of three conditions is satisfied:-
 
 
 (a) an investigation is being carried out under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) ("ASIC Act") or under the Corporations Act in relation to an act or omission by a person, being an act or omission that constitutes or may constitute a contravention of the Corporations Act ; or
 (b) a prosecution has been begun against a person for a contravention of the Corporations Act ; or
 (c) a civil proceeding has been begun against a person under the Corporations Act .

 

2 The orders made in April 2006 were based on the existence of specific investigations being carried out by the Plaintiff, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC"), under the ASIC Act .
Those investigations were identified in the reasons for judgment at the time: ASIC v Carey (No 3) (2006) 232 ALR 577.
The process that has followed the making of those orders, which affected former officers of the Westpoint group and a number of companies in the group, has been long and rather convoluted.
Additional parties have been joined.
There have been incidental and collateral issues of a contentious nature to be determined.
There have been variations and refinements of the orders as particular problems have arisen from time to time.
3 The number of judgments that these proceedings have generated exceeds 20.
At all times it has been necessary to bear in mind the nature and purpose of orders under section 1323.
They are not punitive.
They are intended to protect the interests of potential claimants against the assets and thereby the public interest and are necessarily of a temporary character.
They are temporary because notwithstanding that they are made in the public interest, they involve a significant interference with the property rights and, in the case of these orders, the freedom of movement of the parties affected by them.
4 The Court acting under section 1323 must keep in mind the need to maintain an appropriate balance between those legitimate and competing interests in circumstances in which the evidence before the Court is necessarily incomplete.
As I said in the original judgment, that evidence indicated serious misconduct and possible contraventions of the Corporations Act .
However it was not evidence that was able to support final determinations of civil or criminal liability.
Such determinations were not and could not be sought in these proceedings.
They must be the subject of separate proceedings, be they civil or criminal.
5 ASIC has made it clear that the investigative process, insofar as it would support the continuation of existing orders, is coming to an end.
There have been criminal briefs lodged with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions but no criminal prosecution has begun.
There is a civil proceeding, although at the moment there is some debate about whether ASIC will to take it over and whether section 50 of the ASIC Act empowers it to do so.
Whereas originally ASIC filed a motion seeking what amounted to a two year and three-month extension of the freezing orders, it has now accepted that it is appropriate that the restrictions should continue to apply for just over another three months to the end of June.
It anticipates that the investigations that supported the original orders will come to an end by that date.
6 If further protective orders are thought to be necessary after 30 June, they can be made on the basis of some fresh criterion, such as the beginning of a criminal prosecution or civil proceedings.
Alternatively, freezing orders can be sought as an incident of particular civil proceedings.
It is appropriate that the existing orders should terminate on 30 June.
I am satisfied, having regard to the agreement of the parties, that there is enough life left in the tail-end of the investigative process to justify extension of the orders to 30 June.
7 The extension of the orders being justified to 30 June, it is within my power to accept undertakings offered in lieu of the orders which would otherwise be made.
An undertaking accepted by the Court has the force of an injunction as against the party making the undertaking.
The Court will not accept an undertaking unless it is satisfied that it would have the power to make an order in those terms and that such an order would be, in a broad sense, appropriate.
I am satisfied that the undertakings which are offered, which have been the subject of significant negotiation between ASIC and various parties affected, are within power and are appropriate.
Copies of the undertakings are annexed to these reasons.
First Defendant's Living Allowance 
 
8 One outstanding matter relates to the living allowance that should be allowed to the first defendant, Mr Carey, within the framework of his undertaking.
Under the pre-existing orders that sum has been approved by the receivers, who will no longer continue to be receivers, at $4,000 per week.
That has been the case for some time.
Mr Zilko, on behalf of Mr Carey, says that I should simply extend it, keeping the status quo in place until the end of June.
Mr Owen-Conway on behalf on ASIC says that ASIC does not accept that it is an appropriate amount.
The more appropriate amount would be in the range of $3,000 to $3,250 per week.
9 The difference between the parties does not seem particularly significant in the context of this case and the remaining time for these orders to run.
But given that I am being asked to consider the appropriateness of the figure, I will extend the current allowance for a period of two weeks and require evidentiary support for its extension to 30 June.
After 30 June, of course, the undertaking will terminate and the question no longer arise, unless some fresh order is made in some other proceeding.
In this connection I make the observation that I have already made to Mr Zilko, that the purpose of these orders is protective.
It is not designed to punish respondents or defendants, against whom no positive findings have been made one way or the other.
10 The question requires consideration of the public interest and the legitimate private interests of the individual.
That means that the assessment of the allowance is not to be guided solely by what a reasonable person might think the defendant would need to get by.
It is a question of the overall balance between the protection of the global assets concerned, having regard to the period under which they will remain subject to the order, and the interests of the person affected.
An order will be made that the weekly allowance for ordinary living expenses, fixed in respect of paragraph 7 of the undertaking proffered by the first defendant, is $4,000 per week until 26 March and, thereafter such rate as is fixed by the Court upon consideration of affidavit evidence to be provided by 19 March, along with written submissions.
I certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French.
