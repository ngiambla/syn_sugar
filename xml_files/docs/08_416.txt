1 The second plaintiffs, Anthony McGrath and Christopher Honey ( the Liquidators ), are the liquidators of the first plaintiff, Pan Pharmaceuticals Limited ( Pan ).
The Liquidators have brought this proceeding in the name of Pan and in their capacity as liquidators of Pan.
I shall refer to all plaintiffs as the Liquidators.
2 The defendant, Mr James Selim, was the chief executive officer of Pan.
The Liquidators are claiming damages against Mr Selim on the basis that he breached the duties that he owed to Pan as its chief executive officer.
More specifically, the Liquidators say that Mr Selim failed to ensure that Pan adopted and applied good manufacturing principles ( GMP ).
3 The proceeding has been on foot for some years and it is presently fixed for hearing commencing on 2 June 2008.
Questions have arisen concerning the extent to which the Court should permit the Liquidators to rely upon expert evidence concerning aspects of the operations of Pan that are alleged to have resulted in breach of duties by Mr Selim, including opinion evidence under ss 79 and 80 of the Evidence Act 1995 ( the Evidence Act ).
The questions arise in a context where the Liquidators have failed to comply with the Court's directions in relation to the filing of such evidence.
4 On 9 June 2006, the Court ordered that, by 1 December 2006, the Liquidators serve, inter alia, all affidavits, both lay and expert, on which they wish to rely.
On 16 November 2006, because the Liquidators were unable to comply with that order, the Court ordered that that order be vacated and that, by 31 May 2007, the Liquidators serve all lay affidavits on which they intend to rely and all expert affidavits on which they intend to rely.
However, on 12 March 2007, those orders were also vacated and the Court ordered that the Liquidators serve all lay affidavits on which they intend to rely and all expert affidavits on which they intend to rely by 31 May 2007.
5 The Liquidators failed to comply with the directions of 12 March 2007 so far as they concern expert opinion evidence.
No satisfactory explanation has been provided for the failure, other than that the task was more complex and the identification of appropriate experts was more difficult than had been anticipated.
It is somewhat surprising that no attempt was made by the Liquidators and their advisers, until well after 31 May 2008, to have the matter relisted for the purpose of proffering some explanation and seeking an extension of time for compliance with the directions.
