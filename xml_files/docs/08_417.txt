 
 1 On 30 November 2007 a Federal Magistrate dismissed an application brought by the now Appellant in the Federal Magistrates Court: Lawrance v Commonwealth (No 5) [2007] FMCA 1934.
In that Court, the Federal Magistrate concluded that Ms Lawrance had not established any conduct contrary to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) or the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) and had not established any basis for the grant of relief under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth).
2 Ms Lawrance has filed in this Court a Notice of Appeal seeking to challenge the decision made on 30 November 2007.
3 Now before the Court are three Applications : the first is an Application made by Ms Lawrance seeking to suspend the order as to costs made against her by the Federal Magistrate; the second is an Application made on behalf of the State of New South Wales (the Second Respondent) seeking an order that security for costs be provided and seeking a stay of proceedings until such time as security is provided; and the third is a like Application made on behalf of the remaining respondents.
4 Ms Lawrance appeared unrepresented.
5 It is considered that no order should be made suspending the costs order as made by the Federal Magistrate, that Ms Lawrance should be ordered to provide security for the costs to be incurred by the Respondents to the proceedings in this Court and that a stay of proceedings should be ordered in the event that security is not provided.
THE ORDER FOR COSTS MADE BY THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 
 
6 On 30 November 2007 the orders made by the Federal Magistrate were that the application then before that Court should be dismissed and that Ms Lawrance was to pay the costs of those proceedings either as agreed or taxed.
Those costs have not been paid to date.
7 Also remaining unpaid are costs the subject of an earlier order made on 17 November 2006 by the Federal Magistrate in respect to interlocutory applications.
8 The Notice of Appeal as filed on 12 December 2007 sought an order that the order for costs as made on 30 November 2007 be " suspended, pending the decision of the Federal Court ".
When the matter was called on for hearing on 17 March 2008, Ms Lawrance remained undecided as to whether or not she in fact now sought such an order.
She was, accordingly, requested to decide whether she wished to make such an Application and, later in the day, an Interim Application was filed seeking an order that the order for costs be " suspended under s 29(1)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act ".
9 There was, not unexpectedly, no opposition by the Respondents to the hearing of that Application when the matter resumed on 18 March 2008.
10 An appeal to this Court does not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment appealed: Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), O 52, r 17.
The " general principle " applied in this Court is that an appeal does not operate as a stay: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377 at [6] (Appl'd: Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1556 at [8] ).
But s 29(1)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) does confer a discretionary power to make an order suspending the operation of an order previously made.
That subsection provides as follows:
 
 Stay of proceedings and suspension of orders 
 (1) Where an appeal to the Court from another court has been instituted: 
 ... 
 (b) the Court or a Judge may, by order, on such conditions (if any) as it or he or she thinks fit, suspend the operation of an injunction or other order to which the appeal, in whole or in part, relates.


11 The weight of authority in this Court is that the discretion conferred by s 29(1) is one not to be fettered by requiring the demonstration of special or exceptional circumstances: Stirling Harbour Services Pty Ltd v Bunbury Port Authority (No 2) [2000] FCA 87 at [13] per French J.
An order, however, is not made " simply for the asking ": Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1996] HCA 3 ; (1995) 134 ALR 460 at 463 per Kirby J.
12 In concluding that an order should not be made as sought by Ms Lawrance, reliance has been placed upon a number of considerations.
First, there can be no question but that any costs which may be paid by Ms Lawrance would be recoverable from the Respondents to those proceedings in the event that any appeal is allowed and the order as to costs is varied or vacated.
Second, the order as made by the Federal Magistrate is an order that would normally be expected to be made given the dismissal by that Court of her application.
13 Also taken into account have been those considerations which have led to the conclusion that security for costs should be provided.
SECURITY FOR COSTS: THE PRINCIPLES TO BE APPLIED 
 
14 The Applications made by all Respondents seeking security for costs invoke s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
That section confers a " broad power ": James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 at 444 per Toohey J.
The general principles relevant to the exercise of the discretion are not in dispute and have been conveniently set out by Beazley J in KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 189 and summarised by Bennett J in Croker v Sydney Institute of TAFE (New South Wales) [2003] FCA 942.
