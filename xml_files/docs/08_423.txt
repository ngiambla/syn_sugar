 
1 These reasons relate to the respondents' (Adultshop's) recent and urgent motion to dismiss these proceedings due to non compliance by the applicant (Capital) with an order that it pay into court $68,000 by way of further security for Adultshop's legal costs.
There is a deal of history to this fiercely contested litigation.
Much of it has been relied upon by Capital in its arguments.
The result to date of the failure to pay the security into court has been the stay of the proceedings and the loss of imminent trial dates.
Those dates were finally fixed in proceedings which were commenced as long ago as 2000.
For reasons canvassed below the proceedings will not be dismissed now but if the security is not paid into Court within a further period of three months from the date of publication of these orders, the proceedings will be dismissed without prejudice to the applicant's entitlement to issue further proceedings.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 On 30 January 2008 following a contested hearing on 17 December 2007, I gave reasons ( Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop .com.Limited [2008] FCA 40) requiring Capital to pay into Court, by 20 February 2008 security for Adultshop's costs in the amount of $68,000.
That was quite a brief timeframe, but the reason it was so was because the matter had already been listed for trial for five days from 28 April 2008.
3 The immediate consequence of the non-payment pursuant to the orders made in relation to the payment of security has been that the proceedings have been stayed.
It has been accepted that it therefore follows as a matter of logic, if not by formal application, that the trial dates of 28 April 2008 for five days will have to be vacated.
4 As a separate consequence, by notice of motion dated 25 February 2008, Adultshop moved for orders dismissing the proceedings forthwith due to Capital's failure to comply with the security for costs order.
5 There have been previous security for costs orders.
Capital has paid a total of $65,000 in to Court by way of security for costs in favour of Adultshop.
The first tranche for $30,000 was ordered on 23 August 2000.
Capital failed to provide security in the timeframe stipulated by the Court and took no further steps in the proceedings for over 7 months.
The proceedings were then stayed.
Capital ultimately paid the first tranche into Court on 10 April 2001.
A second tranche in the amount of $35,000 to cover Adultshop's costs up to the final hearing of the proceedings was paid into Court on 20 June 2003 pursuant to orders of Nicholson J, made on 3 April 2003.
6 The current application was brought very soon after the failure to pay in the security.
It is based on s 56(4) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) which provides that if security or further security is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court or a judge may order that the proceeding be dismissed.
7 The discretion of the Court under s 56 of the Act is broad and unfettered but must be exercised judicially.
In Adultshop's submission the following matters are relevant for consideration in the exercise of the discretion under s 56(4) of the Act:
(a) the prospect of Capital being able to post security;
(b) Capital's election to refrain from identifying its potential sources of funding;
 
(c) the quantum of risk that Capital cannot satisfy an order for costs 
 
(d) the delays in the proceeding since commencement, including delays directly attributable to Capital;
 
(e) the inability to meet the trial date or explain the delay in paying further security as ordered; and
 
(f) the continuing prejudice to the respondents by delay.
Evidence of capacity to pay 
 
8 Adultshop stress that Capital has put on no evidence whatsoever of:
 
(a) attempts to pay;
 
(b) capacity to pay; or
 
(c) willingness to pay;
 
the ordered further security.
9 No explanation is proffered for the failure of a company officer (or any other person) to give such evidence.
Lengthy delays by Capital in meeting prior orders for security are conceded.
The inability of Capital, unaided, to satisfy the further security is not disputed.
No evidence of the intentions, capacity or even identity of historical or future litigation financiers is before the Court.
10 Adultshop contends that the proper inference to be drawn from the absence of evidence and, in particular, Capital's failure to call evidence of its efforts, capacity or willingness to pay further security from an officer of Capital should be adverse.
Adultshop stresses that the evidence clearly shows that Capital has no current assets other than this cause of action, that the shareholders of Capital are professional trustees who have no beneficial interest in Capital or in the cause of action and that the inability of Capital to meet from its own funds a security for costs order is readily conceded by Capital.
Adultshop relies upon the fact that there is no evidence before the Court to suggest any improvement in Capital's position and while Capital was able to raise funds to meet earlier security for costs orders, there is no evidence as to the present ability of Capital to raise those funds.
11 Capital relies upon an affidavit of Ms Yin Fang, solicitor for Capital who outlines the history of the previous security for costs orders which have been met by Capital, albeit in some circumstances with a considerable delay.
The other two factors arising from Ms Fang's affidavit are that Capital has spent in excess of the $309,000 in connection with this litigation including a recent payment made in January 2008 in excess of $79,000 in respect of costs and disbursements incurred by Capital's solicitors.
The evidence about that payment is adduced not to demonstrate that Capital was able to find those funds but rather to clarify that the payment was made at a time before any order was made by this Court for security for costs to be paid (that order being foreshadowed in reasons on 30 January 2008).
Legal considerations relating to dismissal for non-payment of security 
 
12 The approach to exercise of the power was expressed by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Microbio Resources Inc v Betatene Ltd [1993] FCA 848 in these terms:
 
 The Court is careful to see that orders for security for costs do not work injustice to parties against whom such orders are made, but if those parties do not comply with the orders and give no evidence or explanation as to why they have not complied with them, they cannot be heard to complain of injustice if, after a considerable length of time, and extensions of time, the ultimate sanction of dismissal is applied.
It is incumbent on parties in such circumstances to provide evidence of their position.


13 Microbio Resources [1993] FCA 848 was followed in Jalpalm Pty Ltd v Hamilton Island Enterprises Pty Ltd  Anor [1995] FCA 1498 per Kiefel J and also in Billinudgel Pastoral Co Pty Ltd  Ors v Westpac Banking Corporation [1994] FCA 728 and Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v Football Federation Australia Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 766.
14 In Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2002] NSWSC 18 at [24] , Einstein J listed five factors flowing from remarks of the Full Court in Microbio Resources [1993] FCA 848.
Those are the factors said to be relevant to the exercise of a discretion as to whether to dismiss a proceeding where there has been a failure to comply with an order for security for costs.
The decision of Einstein J was upheld by the Court of Appeal of New South Wales on that issue in Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2002] NSWCA 271.
Those factors were:
 
1.
The period that has elapsed since security was ordered;
 
2.
The fact that the plaintiff has been on notice of the application for dismissal;
 
3.
The seeming inability of the plaintiff to further fund the main proceedings;
 
4.
The prejudice to the defendants; and
 
5.
The position of the Court.
