 
1 The issue for determination in this proceeding is the quantum of the penalty which should be imposed on an employer for multiple breaches of an industrial award.
The proceeding is an application brought by a workplace inspector seeking the imposition by the Court of penalties on the employer for breaching the Hospitality Industry --- Accommodation Hotels, Resorts and Gaming Award 1998 ("the award").
As the relevant time period during which the breaches occurred spans from 14 August 2000 to 9 November 2007, the application relies on s 178 (now repealed) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act "), as it applied prior to 27 March 2006, and s 719 of the Act as it applied thereafter.
2 From 14 August 2000 until 9 November 2007, Mrs Healey carried on a business as a sole trader under the business name "Theatre Royal Hotel".
The business included accommodation facilities, a restaurant and a caf-bar.
During that time persons employed by her were entitled to the benefit of the award.
There were 41 employees of Mrs Healey who were engaged as casuals and who were paid below award rates and, in one case, not paid at all.
The award entitlements 
 
3 Clause 15 of the award provides for three categories of employees: full-time, regular part-time and casual.
Clause 15.2.2 provides:
 
 A casual employee shall be paid per hour at the rate of 1/38 of the weekly rate prescribed for the class of work performed, plus the appropriate undermentioned addition to that rate: 
 ... 
 

4 The "undermentioned addition(s)" are provided by cls 15.2.2(a), (b), (c) and (d).
Clause 15.2.2(a) provides certain allowances for work performed between 7 pm and midnight on week days and work performed between midnight and 7 am on those days.
In addition, cl 15.2.2(a) provides for a Monday to Friday casual loading.
Clause 15.2.2(b) provides for a Saturday casual loading.
Clause 15.2.2(c) provides for a Sunday casual loading and cl 15.2.2(d) provides for a public holiday casual loading.
5 Clause 18.1 of the award sets the wage rate for the various classifications of employees covered by the award.
Clause 15.5 of the award sets junior rates for those employees who are 19 years of age or younger.
