 
1 On 23 November 2007, following an urgent hearing, I made the following orders:
 
 1.
The application be dismissed.
2.
The respondent's notice of motion to dismiss the proceedings filed on 2 November 2007 be dismissed.
3.
Costs reserved.


2 Counsel expressed a desire to make written submissions on the question of costs in light of the fact that each of the parties had been partially successful in their arguments.
I have now had the advantage of considering those written submissions.
STATUTORY BACKGROUND 
 
3 Sections 43(1) and (2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) enables the Court to award costs in its discretion.
4 The text of s 43 relevantly provides as follows:
 
 
 (1) ..., the Court or a Judge has jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before the Court (including proceedings dismissed for want of jurisdiction) other than proceedings in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded.

 ... 
 (2) Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge.

 
 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
 
5 The usual approach is that costs will follow the event.
The effect of this approach is that even if an unsuccessful litigant has succeeded on some parts of the claim, the unsuccessful litigant would usually pay the costs of the successful litigant.
I say 'usually' as there are widely recognised exceptions.
Costs following the event, as counsel for both parties recognise, is a rule which may be modified where each of the litigants has enjoyed some success.
6 Mr Horn has asked that I should treat his application as one involving public interest litigation which would attract special considerations in the exercise of the Court's discretion.
7 In particular, Mr Horn says that the following matters should be taken into account:
 
 (a) his success in the notice of motion, both as to the existence of a 'matter' sufficient to ground the jurisdiction of the Court under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and further, my rejection of the respondent's assertion that the proceedings were in some way brought frivolously or vexatiously;
 (b) my findings at [26] of the reasons for judgment ( Horn v Australian Electoral Commission [2007] FCA 1827) as to Mr Horn's motivation and responsible conduct of the proceedings;
 (c) the legitimate characterisation of the proceedings as being within the category of 'public interest litigation'; and
 (d) the strongly arguable nature of numerous aspects of the application's merits.

 PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION 
 
8 Mr Horn's primary position is that I should make no order as to costs for reasons reflected in the subparagraphs outlined above.
His secondary position is that any costs order made in favour of the respondent should reflect a variety of matters including those factors listed above.
9 The submission that there should be no order as to costs turns in significant measure on the suggested characterisation of this litigation as public interest litigation.
That argument in turn relies primarily upon the High Court decision of Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 in which the appellant had sought a declaration that a development consent order the council had granted was void and of no effect.
Notwithstanding his failure to obtain such an order, the appellant was not ordered to pay the costs of the respondent.
The Court of Appeal of New South Wales overturned that order and the High Court, by a narrow majority, in turn allowed the appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal.
In the joint judgment of Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [49], their Honours said:
 
 
 [49] The primary judge reasoned from a starting point which favoured costs orders against the appellant as the unsuccessful party.
However, he correctly drew a distinction earlier expressed as follows by Menzies J, with the concurrence of Kitto, Taylor and Windeyer JJ: 
 
 
 "Prohibitions and restrictions such as those under consideration are directed towards public health and comfort and the orderly arrangement of municipal areas and are imposed, not for the benefit of particular individuals, but for the benefit of the public or at least a section of the public, viz those living in the municipal area.
" 
 
 
 Having characterised the nature of the litigation as concerned with public rather than private rights, Stein J stated that "something more" than the categorisation of proceedings as public interest litigation was needed before a successful defendant should be denied costs.
Stein J then isolated the factors identified in pars (iii), (iv) and (v) of the summary given earlier in these reasons as sufficient special circumstances.
In proceeding to exercise in this fashion the discretion conferred by s 69 , Stein J did not take into account considerations which can be said to have been definitely extraneous to any objects the legislature could have had in view in enacting s 69 and in relation to the operation of s 69 upon proceedings instituted under s 123 of the EPA Act.
The contrary is the case.

Earlier in the judgment at [20] there was reference to the factors mentioned by their Honours.
Those factors were:
 
 
 ... 
 (iii) The appellant's pursuit of the litigation was motivated by his desire to ensure obedience to environmental law and to preserve the habitat of the endangered koala on and around the site; he had nothing to gain from the litigation "other than the worthy motive of seeking to uphold environmental law and the preservation of endangered fauna".

 (iv) In the present case, "a significant number of members of the public" shared the stance of the appellant as to the development to take place on the site, the preservation of the natural features and flora of the site, and the impact on endangered fauna, especially the koala.
In that sense there was a "public interest" in the outcome of the litigation.

 (v) The basis of the challenge was arguable and had raised and resolved "significant issues" as to the interpretation and future administration of statutory provisions relating to the protection of endangered fauna and relating to the ambit and future administration of the subject development consent; these issues had "implications" for the Council, the developer and the public.

10 In Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at [10] , Black CJ and French J referred to Bray CJ in Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 (at 11) where he said: 
 
 I think the guiding principle still stands as it left the House of Lords in the famous case of Donald Campbell  Co v Pollak, that the general discretion is absolute and unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially, not arbitrarily or capriciously, and that it cannot be exercised on grounds unconnected with the litigation.


11 It was observed in Ruddock (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; 115 FCR 229 at [10] that:
 
 [t]he principle has also been adopted expressly in relation to s 43: See Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 156; 141 ALR 727 (at 732); Scott v Secretary, Department of Social Security (No 2) [2000] FCA 1450 (at [2]).
