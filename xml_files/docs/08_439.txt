INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Some years ago now, Mr and Mrs Lowe carried on an interstate transport business in partnership under the name "G  E Lowe".
This proceeding concerns a truck that they bought from Mack Trucks Australia Pty Ltd (referred to hereafter as 'Mack') in 1998.
The truck was a new Mack CH Elite Highway prime mover (hereafter 'the truck' or the 'Lowes' truck'), which Mack had manufactured.
The Lowes' case is that Mack assured them that the truck was suitable for their interstate long-haul transport business (hereafter 'the business' or 'the Lowes' business'), when in fact it was not.
They seek damages in respect of the loss allegedly suffered as a result.
For the reasons that follow, I find that their claim is not made out.
2 The Lowes conducted the business from Adelaide, transporting goods by truck from Adelaide to Brisbane, Sydney and other destinations mostly along the east coast of Australia.
On 23 March 1998, they entered into a conditional contract with Mack to purchase the truck, for a price of $209,230.
Although the Lowes initially contemplated a Freightliner or Western Star model vehicle as a changeover for their then current Mack CHR (which they purchased in 1995), they gave consideration to a new Mack when they were offered a competitive price.
Mr Dean Kumnick, a Mack branch salesman in Adelaide, stated that the truck would be suitable for their needs.
He knew that the Lowes were involved in the business of interstate long-haul goods transport as truck owner-operators.
3 On 1 April 1998, Mr Lowe took delivery of the truck from Mack and set out to drive the truck from Adelaide to Brisbane and back, towing a fully loaded Tautliner trailer.
Mr Lowe noticed problems with the truck almost immediately.
He complained to Mack in Brisbane and, on his return, to Mack in Adelaide.
4 It was part of the Lowes' case that "[t]he litany of complaints was so bad" that as early as June 1998, the Lowes asked Mack about the possibility of returning the truck on a walk-away (or no-loss or no-cost) basis.
As appears below, the evidence did not establish as much.
The evidence did, however, establish that Mrs Lowe enquired about returning the truck on a walk-away basis in October 1998.
5 In early 1999, the Lowes' complaints about the truck led to it being included in a group of trucks selected for examination by Roaduser International Pty Ltd (hereafter 'Roaduser') as part of an inquiry by the Federal Office of Road Safety (hereafter 'FORS') into aspects of long-haulage road transport operation in Australia.
Indeed, in an initial "inspect and drive" test organised by Roaduser, Mr John Lambert, who gave evidence at the trial, reported that the truck exhibited characteristics of vibration, wandering and darting.
The FORS Inquiry resulted in a Final Report, entitled "Investigation into the Specification of Heavy Trucks and Consequent Effects on Truck Dynamics and Drivers".
In this proceeding, this report was referred to as the 'FORS Report'.
This Report is discussed below.
6 Throughout the period he drove the truck, Mr Lowe complained about it, especially its rough ride and poor performance.
The Lowes claimed that, over the period they operated the truck, these characteristics were made manifest by various things, particularly vibration, inordinate component failures, and the need for constant repairs and parts replacement.
The Lowes' case was that the on-going defects in the truck ultimately led Mr Lowe to 'park up' the truck at Rick Cobby's depot and 'walk away' from it.
They claimed that they did so "despite the clear and substantial financial ramifications" for them and the business.
7 The genesis of this proceeding was a class action that began on 17 May 1999.
The class action was unable to proceed as such and, by an application and statement of claim dated 11 October 2001, the Lowes elected to continue the proceeding as applicants in their own right against Mack and Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited (referred to below as 'AGC'), which had financed the truck's purchase.
The proceeding against AGC has been resolved.
The matter took some time to be ready for trial, in part because of changes in legal representation.
8 At trial, the applicants complained of the truck's rough ride, poor handling and poor performance, which they said was manifest by "vibration, darting and wandering and a litany of breakages, repairs and premature replacement of parts".
The applicants alleged that there was a general design problem with big trucks, such as theirs.
In this regard, they relied on the FORS Inquiry and Report, which they said (written submissions, 1.2.2) was a response to industry complaints about poor handling and performance associated with
 
 ... the trend to increased variation in the specification combinations of vehicles with larger wheelbases, taller cabins, more powerful engines, loads with higher centres of gravity, airbag suspension and the failure of some manufacturers to adequately test proposed vehicle configurations and use.



 
9 Also at trial, the applicants alleged that there was a specific fault in the truck with the application of the panhard rods to the same side of the chassis.
This meant, so they said, that the panhard rods in the truck did not fulfil the objective of transverse rods, which was to keep the axles centred laterally.
The applicants also claimed (written submissions, 1.2.8) that air bag suspensions contributed to "potential instability in trucks generally" and to "the overall problem whereby each element provides potential feedback to the others".
They relied on the evidence of Mr Lambert to make good this proposition.
10 As the applicants said, "[a] feature of [their] case" was "the question of the harmonic signature of the vehicle".
In this regard, they relied on the evidence of Mr Lambert and Dr Arnold McLean as to how harmonics work.
Mack challenged their evidence on the basis that Mr Lambert and Dr McLean had 
 
 ... lost all objectivity in respect of ... this case and that there are certain personal agendas which both persons have which they wish to further.


I return to this submission hereafter.

THE APPLICANTS' FURTHER AMENDED STATEMENT OF CLAIM 
 
11 The Further Amended Statement of Claim runs to some 40 pages and asserts numerous causes of action, including breach of contract, negligence, breaches of ss 52 , 53 (a), 53 (aa), 53 (ea) and 53 (g) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (TPA) and unconscionable conduct contrary to ss 51AA and 51AC of the TPA.
The Lowes also relied on the Fair Trading Act 1987 (SA) and the Sale of Goods Act 1895 (SA), but did not suggest that the State Acts would produce a result different from the TPA.
Save for a brief discussion in the context of damages, I do not discuss them further.
The applicants sought various remedies (see below) but they did not press their claim for personal injuries, or exemplary and aggravated damages.
12 By the end of the trial, the applicants had effectively abandoned much of their pleaded case.
This was confirmed by the applicants' closing written submissions, which contained a statement of their claims.
This was the applicants' best written statement of the case they sought to make at trial.
The applicants did not pursue any matter outside this summary, and they effectively abandoned their claims based on ss 53(a) , 53 (aa), 53 (ea) and 53 (g) of the TPA and unconscionable conduct.
13 The applicants' summary was as follows:
 
 
 2.1.1 Pursuant to the Further Amended Statement of Claim dated 13 August 2002 the principal allegations may be summarised and paraphrased as: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Lowes expressly or by implication made known to [Mack] the particular purpose for which the truck was required.
That purpose was interstate long-haul transport operations; 
 (b) the Lowes relied on the skill and judgement of [Mack] in selecting an appropriate vehicle for their purpose; and further 
 (c) [ Mack] made representations or gave warranties including: 
 
 
 
 (i) the truck was ideally suited for the Lowes' purpose; 
 (ii) the truck would provide safe, reliable and efficient service for at least 800,000 kilometres; and 
 (iii) the truck would provide a very good ride.

 
 
 2.1.2 In these circumstances it is alleged that there are implied conditions of the Contract of Sale that the truck would be: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) reasonably fit for the purpose; and 
 
 
 
 (b) of merchantable quality.

 
 
 2.1.3 These implied conditions arise pursuant to section 71(1)  (2) of the [TPA] .... 
 2.1.4 The definition of 'consumer' in the [TPA] includes the purchaser of a commercial road vehicle regardless of price.
(See section 4B(1)(a) and (4) of the [TPA] ) Section 66(2) of the [TPA] provides a definition of 'merchantable quality'.

 2.1.5 Further, it is alleged there are express terms of the Contract of Sale that, inter alia: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the truck was ideally suited for the purpose of interstate long-haul road transport; 
 (b) the truck would provide safe, reliable and efficient service for at least 800,000 kilometres; 
 (c) the truck would handle and drive well; 
 (d) the truck is performance engineered with a perfect blend of reliability, durability and efficiency.

 
 
 
 
 2.1.6 In reliance upon various representations and warranties set out in the Amended Statement of Claim, the Lowes purchased the truck from [Mack].

 2.1.7 Particulars of the defects that establish that the Lowes' truck was not fit for its purpose are set out in the amendments to paragraph 16 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim and filed in the course of the trial.

 2.1.8 The defects were caused by: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) design and construction failures; and 
 (b) defective and inadequate examination and testing of the truck and its components.

 
 
 
 
 2.1.9 The failure of design and construction are set out in the amendments in paragraph 19A of the Further Amended Statement of Claim filed during the course of the trial.
Particulars of the inadequate examination and testing are set out in paragraph 19B.

 2.1.10 To the extent that the Lowe truck is found: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) not to be safe and reliable; 
 (b) not to be ideally suited or reasonably fit for interstate long-haul transport operations; 
 (c) not to provide safe, reliable, proper and efficient service for 800,000 kilometres; 
 (d) not to provide a high standard of drive; 
 (e) not performance engineered with a perfect blend of reliability, durability and efficiency for a broad range of specific applications including long-haul interstate road transport; 
 (f) not of merchantable quality; 
 
 
 
 
 
 the Lowes have causes of action including: 
 
 
 
 
 (g) For breach of section 71(1)  (2) of the [TPA].
(h) ... 
 (i) For breach of warranty.

 (j) For breach of the terms and conditions of the Contract of Sale.

 (k) For breach of a duty of care owed to the [Lowes] (as purchasers) giving rise to a cause of action founded in negligence.

 
 
 
 
 2.1.11 Pursuant to the Amended Application dated 27 September 2001 the remedies sought principally are: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) Damages and/or compensation pursuant to ss 75AD, 82 and 87 of the [TPA];
 (b) An order pursuant to s 87(1)  (2) of the [TPA] declaring the whole of the contract between the Lowes and [Mack] void ab initio and/or directing [Mack] to refund to the Lowes the monies paid by them.

 (c) Common law damages for breach of contract and negligence.

 together with interest and costs.

 
 

14 When this summary and the Further Amended Statement of Claim are compared, it is apparent that many details in the applicants' pleaded case were not pursued and some causes of action were dropped from their case entirely.
In closing, the applicants' counsel agreed that the key issue in the case was whether or not defects in the Lowes' truck rendered it unfit for the purpose of interstate long-haul goods transport.
Broadly speaking, the applicant's counsel agreed with the respondent's counsel that the central issue was whether the Lowes could successfully invoke s 71 of the TPA by establishing that, on account of defects in construction and design, the truck was unfit for this purpose and not of merchantable quality.
15 At trial, the applicants filed amendments to [16] and [19] of the Further Amended Statement of Claim.
The amendment to [16] asserted some 55 defects, which were said to make the truck unfit for purpose, and these included:
 
 rough ride including: 
 (i) vibration; and 
 
 
 (ii) poor handling characteristics such as excessive bump steer, bogie axle roll steer and drive axle low roll resistance 
 
 

Further matters were: chassis bowed and bent; cab mounts; top leaf in springs; steer tyre wear; axle camber wrong; rear engine mounts cracked and separated; severe vibration (downhill first, second and third gears); and suspension problems.
There were, however, many further matters, which I do not list here.
I note that some of them were not the subject of evidence at trial and were not pursued in closing submissions.
16 The amendment to [19] affirmed that these defects were caused by: 
 
 
 (a) the failure of the design and construction of the truck to meet the requirements of the use of the prime mover for long-haul transport; and
 (b) defective or inadequate examination and testing of the truck and its components.

 

17 The applicants gave 26 instances of the failure of the design and construction, and again not all of them were actively pursued at the trial.
Broadly speaking, they fell into the following categories: (1) incorrect installation and design of the suspension system in that transverse rods were both mounted to the same side of the chassis; (2) uneven distribution of air pressure through the air suspension system and variable airbag pressure; (3) adverse operation of right height control valve; (4) drive line torsional vibrations; (5) cut out of the top and bottom chassis rail flanges; (6) inadequate front engine mounting design; (7) steering mechanism exhibiting excessive bump steer; (8) adverse kinematic geometry in steering column to steering box input shaft; (9) significant outer edge scalloping and uneven wear of steer tyres; (10) vehicle handling erratically and unpredictably due to flexible chassis vibrations, torsional loading and bogie axle roll steer; (11) inadequate design of the driver's seat mechanism; (12) cyclic twisting of the chassis due to the combination of torsionally rigid trailers with high centre of gravity load; and (13) the harmonic signature of the vehicle being of a frequency too closely matched to external excitation sources such as drive wheels and vehicle pitching and rocking thereby causing adverse frequency phenomena through the vehicle chassis.
18 Also in these pleading amendments, the applicants introduced a new [19B], which asserted that the defective or inadequate examination and testing of the truck included:
 
 (a) The failure to test the prime mover during its construction so as to ascertain its harmonic signature and its suitability for long haulage interstate high centre of gravity high gross mass loads with a torsionally rigid trailer; and 
 (b) The failure to test the prime mover once its construction was completed, or a vehicle of like specifications was completed, so as to ascertain the suitability of the prime mover for long haulage interstate high centre of gravity high gross mass loads with a torsionally rigid trailer.


19 In closing oral submissions, the applicants' case was further narrowed.
Their counsel effectively abandoned any solely contractual cause of action, i.e., not depending on s 71 of the TPA.
This was unsurprising, given that the evidence about any relevant contract of sale was limited.
20 At the time Mr Lowe parked up the truck, he and Mrs Lowe were purchasing the truck by way of a hire purchase agreement with AGC, pursuant to which AGC acquired the truck and hired it to the Lowes.
The evidence before the Court included a copy of a Quotation dated 23 March 1998 for the sale of the truck, "New Truck Proposal" for the truck signed by Mrs Lowe on or about 23 March 1998, AGC's Standard Asset Purchase Agreement Schedule with the applicants, which was dated 27 March 1998 and named Mack as the supplier, as well as a warranty registration form signed and dated 31 March 1998 and "New Vehicle Warranty Information".
The documentary evidence did not include either AGC's "Standard Conditions" (as referred in AGC's Schedule) or any particular contract of sale (with AGC or any other person).
It is true that Mr Kumnick gave clear evidence of his pre-contractual negotiations with the Lowes.
There was, however, little, if any, foundation for a separate cause of action in contract, at least for one independent of s 71 of the TPA; and the applicants' counsel did not ultimately contend to the contrary.
21 Moreover, in closing submissions, the applicants accepted that, if they failed to make out their claim based on s 71 of the TPA, then they would fail to make out their negligence claim.
Accordingly, I do not hereafter discuss claims in negligence or contract simpliciter (i.e., apart from s 71 of the TPA).
22 Indeed, apart from the s 71- based claims, in closing oral submissions, counsel for the applicant conceded that the only other remaining claim that the applicants pursued was a limited claim based on s 52 of the TPA.
