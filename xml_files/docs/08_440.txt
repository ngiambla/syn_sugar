 
 1 On 1 November 2007 the applicants filed an application alleging against the respondents breaches of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
The application had been preceded by pre-action discovery orders: see Keshi Pty Ltd v Firefly Press (Australia) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 982.
The subject matter of the dispute is most conveniently taken from the opening paragraphs of that decision:
 
 
 1.
There are forty-four individual speech sounds in the English language.
The individual speech sounds are referred to as "phonemes".
A phoneme may be represented by a letter, or one or more combinations of letters of the alphabet, which are referred to as "graphemes".
For example, the words "moon", "screw" and "glue" contain a common phoneme represented by the combination of the letters "oo", "ew" and "ue".
2.
Ms Denyse Ritchie, a retired teacher and director of the applicant, developed a chart to be used in literacy teaching which depicted words and pictures incorporating the phonemes and graphemes on a chart.
The chart is known as the "THRASS Picturechart" and is published in two formats, as a wall chart and "tumble turn" desk chart.
These charts were first published in 1996 and released for sale in both the United Kingdom and Australia that year.
In 2005, Ms Ritchie became aware of a chart published by the respondent which also depicted words and pictures incorporating phonemes and graphemes.
The respondent's chart is called the "Sound Waves Sound Chart".

 
 STATEMENT OF CLAIM 
 
2 The application was accompanied by a statement of claim.
There has been a dispute in relation to the provision of certain particulars in support of the statement of claim.
The respondents have filed and served a defence denying any breaches.
3 It is common ground as pleaded that the first applicant carries on a business of advertising, promoting, selling and supplying educational aids for the use of children.
In conducting that business and pursuant to the terms of a licence agreement, it uses certain charts which collectively are described as being the THRASS Copyright Works.
The second applicant is a joint author and owner of the THRASS Copyright Works.
4 The first respondent promotes and sells educational literary aids for children in the form of a chart described as a Sound Waves Chart and student work books incorporating the Sound Waves Chart.
5 The second respondent is a retired school teacher and the third respondent is, according to the pleading, currently a school teacher.
6 Paragraph 6 pleads that the respondents acted in concert or as agents for each other in the acts pleaded in the statement of claim.
7 Paragraph 7 asserts the infringement of the applicants' copyright by the respondents.
8 Paragraph 8 sets out a claim in detinue and conversion in respect of the same works and by the same respondents.
9 By paragraph 9, it is pleaded the second and third respondents have transmitted and distributed or caused to be authorised the transmission and distribution to the first respondent of the alleged infringing copies together with other reproduction material, thereby further infringing the applicants' copyright.
Paragraph 10 sets out a similar plea.
10 Paragraph 11 sets out relevant knowledge of the respondents.
11 Paragraph 12 pleads the receipt by the respondents of remuneration to which they are not entitled.
12 Paragraph 13 pleads that the respondents did not believe they were entitled to the copyright works.
13 By paragraph 14, a pleading of a constructive trust is set out.
14 Paragraph 15 deals with loss and damage for the copyright plea.
15 Paragraphs 16-20 rely on Pt V of the Trade Practices Act in relation to similar conduct, particularly representations and par 21 pleads loss and damage for the Trade Practices Act plea.
A plea for restraint concludes the statement of claim in par 23.
PARTICULARS 
 
16 On 28 November 2007 orders were made for further and better particulars of the pleading to be sought if required, and provided if sought.
Certain particulars were requested.
Some were supplied.
Others were not.
17 The respondents now complain that in the absence of specific particulars which have been sought of the applicants, it is not possible for the respondents to provide discovery defined by the pleaded issues.
These reasons deal with those areas of dispute which remain after certain particulars have been given.
