 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 These three 'appeals' from decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) were, by consent, heard together.
Each of the applicants was an investor in the Northern Rivers Tea Tree Oil Project (the project).
The project was described in detail in Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight (2004) 136 FCR 211.
In Sleight 136 FCR 211 , the Full Court held that those parts of the investment by the applicants which did not constitute actual cash outlays did not give rise to allowable tax deductions.
Those investments were part of a scheme.
When viewed objectively, they were made to obtain a tax benefit.
2 The applicants sought to distinguish their positions from that of Mr Sleight.
