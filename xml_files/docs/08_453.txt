1 Before the Court are five appeals brought by St George Bank Limited ( SGB ) under s 14ZZ(a)(ii) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ( TA Act ) against objection decisions of the respondent, the Commissioner of Taxation, dated 30 August 2005.
These decisions disallowed objections to assessments of income tax for years of income ending 30 September 1999 to 30 September 2003, being substituted accounting periods for the years of income ending on the preceding 30 June.
2 The five proceedings raise the same issues.
The proceedings concern the deductibility of interest payments made by SGB to a Delaware-incorporated subsidiary company, St George Funding Company LLC ( LLC ), pursuant to its obligations under a subordinated debenture.
The claimed deductions in the relevant years of income were $45,548,093 (1999), $49,831,034 (2000), $57,616,769 (2001), $53,954,975 (2002) and $45,686,065 (2003).
3 The facts are not in dispute.
The evidence consisted of six affidavits from directors and officers of SGB and documentary exhibits.
None of the deponents was cross-examined.
Objection was taken to parts of their affidavits.
The parties, through senior counsel, were content to have those rulings, together with the rulings on certain documents, made in these reasons.
Brief factual background 
 
4 An understanding of the issues is most easily gained by a short overview of the essential facts.
In 1997, SGB merged (by a scheme of arrangement) with Advance Bank Australia Limited ( Advance ) by acquiring all the issued ordinary share capital in Advance.
The details of that transaction are unnecessary to dwell on, except to say that the transaction left SGB with an issue to solve in relation to its banking activities.
At the time of the transaction, it was understood by senior officers and the board of SGB that, because of the outflow of cash to pay for the shares in Advance, the completion of the merger would see SGB's position fall below the regulatory or prudential capital requirements of the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ), satisfaction of which was a condition of SGB holding a banking licence.
It was to deal with this problem that an arrangement was entered that threw up the controversy in these proceedings.
LLC was established and capitalised to US$107.2 million by share subscription of common stock of LLC by two wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries of SGB (Dysty Pty Limited and Buchelin Pty Limited, hereafter referred to as Dysty and Buchelin ).
LLC also issued US$250 million preference stock in the US market.
Although issued in the US debt market, such stock was a form of preference share and sums payable on it were dividends.
LLC then lent US$350 million to SGB under an indenture, and a debenture was issued by SGB to LLC (to which I will refer as the Debenture ).
It is the deductibility of the interest paid on that borrowing that is in issue in these proceedings.
Further funds were raised by SGB by a separate subordinated note issue in the United States.
No issue arises from that raising in these proceedings.
5 The consequence of the arrangements was that the RBA was satisfied that SGB satisfied the minimum ratio of qualifying capital to risk-weighted assets, both on a consolidated basis, and on a stand-alone basis by SGB.
Relevant to this analysis and to the satisfaction of the RBA was the character of the capital raised by LLC (as part of the consolidated group) and of the subordinated debt represented by the Debenture raised by SGB from LLC.
Issues --- dead and alive 
 
6 SGB claimed the amounts referred to above as deductions under s 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ( the 1997 Act ).
This was, and is, denied by the Commissioner.
The present and live debate about the applicability of s 8-1 is whether the payments of interest on the Debenture were outgoings of capital, or of a capital nature, for s 8-1(2), as asserted by the Commissioner.
Previously, the Commissioner had denied, but now concedes, that the payments were incurred by SGB in gaining or producing its assessable income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing its assessable income for the purposes of s 8-1(1).
7 Thus, the first live issue is whether the interest payments were capital for the purposes of s 8-1(2) of the 1997 Act.
8 The Commissioner also invoked Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ( the 1936 Act ), by making a determination pursuant to s 177F of the 1936 Act.
This was abandoned.
9 The Commissioner also sought to impose penalties under Part VII of the 1936 Act in respect of the years of income ended 30 September 1998 to 30 September 2000, and administrative penalties under Division 284 of Schedule 1 to the TA Act in respect of the years of income ended 30 September 2001 to 30 September 2003.
With the abandonment of the assertions based on Part IVA of the 1936 Act, these issues also fell away.
10 The abandonment of the arguments based on Part IVA also led to the dismissal, by consent, of the proceedings in relation to the 1998 year of income, as out of time.
11 The Commissioner has also abandoned an argument that the Debenture was a convertible note within the meaning of s 82L(2) of the 1936 Act, so that a deduction was disallowed by s 82R(3) of the 1936 Act.
12 The second live issue is whether a valid election was made by SGB pursuant to item 118(6)(b) of Schedule 1 to the New Business Taxation System (Debt and Equity) Act 2001 (Cth) ( the Debt/Equity Act ) to invoke the provisions in that Act introduced into the 1997 Act as Division 974 ( the Debt/Equity Provisions ).
13 If the election was valid (or not invalid), the issue arises whether the payments from 1 July 2001 were "a non-share distribution" for the purposes of Division 974 of the 1997 Act, and thus not an allowable deduction by reason of s 26-26 of the 1997 Act, even if they would otherwise have been deductible under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act.
For reasons that will become apparent, there is no need to decide this issue and related questions of statutory construction.
My views in summary 
 
14 The outgoings were outgoings of capital or of a capital nature for the purposes of s 8-1(2)(a) of the 1997 Act.
This was so because, in short, the advantage sought and obtained by them, assessed in the whole context of the capital raising, was not the use by the borrower of the money during the term of the loan, but the maintenance and support of the capital raised by LLC.
15 No valid election was made under item 118(6) or (10) of Schedule 1 of the Debt/Equity Act, there being absent in the relevant election document information required to be included.
16 The issues concerning Division 974 of the 1997 Act therefore do not arise.
The facts in more detail 
 
17 The acquisition of all the ordinary shares in Advance was effected by a scheme of arrangement and was intended to be financed through a combination of cash reserves, the issue of shares to the shareholders of Advance and a new capital raising of $360 million.
18 The merger had an effect on SGB's capital ratios.
These capital ratios and information concerning them came from statements and requirements of the RBA (the banking regulator in 1996 and 1997).
The minimum capital requirements for banks were contained in Prudential Statement C1 ( PSC1 ).
Compliance with this statement was a central requirement of SGB's business.
The relevant parts of the PSC1 were as follows:
 
 Minimum Capital Standards 
 
 
 10.
Each Australian bank is expected to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets, on both a consolidated group and stand-alone basis, of 8 percent (of which at least 4 per cent should be Tier 1 capital).
These levels will be kept under review.

 Definition of Capital 
 
 12.
Capital is the cornerstone of a bank's strength.
The presence of substantial capital re-assures creditors and engenders confidence in a bank.
