 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant (Mr Pomare) appeals from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal) given on 19 December 2007.
The Tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction to hear Mr Pomare's application to it for a review of a decision of a delegate of the first respondent (Minister).
2 The appeal raises the question of whether the Tribunal was correct to decide that it lacked jurisdiction because the application to the Tribunal was lodged outside the nine day period referred to in s 500(6B) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).
3 For the reasons that appear below, in my opinion Mr Pomare was not notified of the Minister's decision in accordance with s 501G(1) of the Act, and so the nine day period did not begin to run.
In the result, the reason given by the Tribunal for holding that it lacked jurisdiction was not a valid reason, and the matter should be referred back to the Tribunal to be heard and determined in accordance with law.
4 The second respondent entered an appearance submitting to such order as the Court might make save as to costs.
BACKGROUND 
 
5 Mr Pomare is a citizen of New Zealand, is unmarried and has no children.
He first arrived in Australia on 26 August 2005.
He holds a Class TY Subclass 444 Special Category visa.
He has remained in Australia since his arrival, except for a nine month absence from November 2005 to August 2006.
6 On 15 February 2007, Mr Pomare was convicted at Broken Hill District Court of robbery using corporal violence and was sentenced to two years and three months imprisonment with a non-parole of 12 months.
7 Subsection 501(2) of the Act provided that the Minister could cancel a visa that had been granted to a person if the Minister reasonably suspected that the person did not pass the character test, and the person did not satisfy the Minister that the person passed the character test.
On 11 October 2007, a delegate of the Minister cancelled Mr Pomare's visa.
It is not in dispute that the conditions laid down in s 501(2) were satisfied.
8 Paragraph 500(1)(b) of the Act provided that an application could be made to the Tribunal for a review of a decision of a delegate of the Minister under s 501.
It is not disputed that Mr Pomare had a right to have the delegate's discretionary decision to cancel his visa reviewed by the Tribunal.
Subsection 500(6B) provided:
 If a decision under section 501 of this Act relates to a person in the migration zone, an application to the Tribunal for a review of the decision must be lodged with the Tribunal within 9 days after the day on which the person was notified of the decision in accordance with subsection 501G(1).
Accordingly, paragraph 29(1)(d) and subsections 29(7), (8), (9) and (10) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 do not apply to the application.
9 Mr Pomare was "in the migration zone" at all relevant times.
The various provisions in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (AAT Act) referred to in s 500(6B) were provisions allowing the Tribunal to extend time for the making of applications for review to the Tribunal.
It follows from their exclusion that the nine day time limit could not be extended.
10 Subsection 501G(1) of the Act provided that if a decision was made under, relevantly, s 501(2) of the Act to cancel a visa granted to a person, the Minister was required to give the person a written notice that set out the decision and met other requirements as to the content of the notice.
Paragraph 501G(1)(f) provides, relevantly, that in relation to a decision made by a delegate of the Minister under s 501(2) which the person had a right to have reviewed by the Tribunal, the notice was required, inter alia, to be one that:
 (iv) states where the application for review can be made; and (v) ... sets out the effect of subsections 500(6A) to (6L) (inclusive); ... 
11 By letter dated 11 October 2007, an officer of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship wrote to Mr Pomare at the John Morony Correctional Centre, Locked Bag 654, Windsor NSW 2756, advising him that a delegate of the Minister cancelled his visa on 11 October 2007, and that a notice setting out reasons for the cancellation, including all matters considered by the delegate when making his decision, would be sent to Mr Pomare shortly.
12 On 17 October 2007 the foreshadowed further notice was delivered by hand to Mr Pomare.
An acknowledgment of receipt of the " Notice of visa cancellation under subsection 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 " was signed by Mr Pomare and witnessed on 17 October 2007.
The question that arises on the appeal is whether on 17 October 2007, Mr Pomare was notified of the cancellation decision "in accordance with subsection 501G(1)" (see s 500(6B) of the Act).
The Tribunal proceeded on the basis that he was.
If the Tribunal was correct to proceed on that basis, Mr Pomare's application for review, which was not received by the Tribunal until 1 November 2007, was received outside the nine day time limit (which expired on 26 October 2007) and the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction in respect of the application.
13 The Minister does not dispute that if the notice that was delivered to Mr Pomare on 17 October 2007 was not in accordance with s 501G(1) of the Act, the nine day time limit did not begin to run.
CONSIDERATION 
 
14 On the hearing of the appeal, Mr Pomare filed in Court with leave an amended notice of appeal stating as questions of law the following:
 
 
 (i) whether the facts fully found by the AAT...fell within sub-para 501G(1)(f)(iv) of the Migration Act 1958 
 (ii) whether the facts fully found by the AAT...fell within sub-para 501G(1)(f)(v) of the Migration Act 1958 
 (iii) whether the AAT had jurisdiction, under s 500(1)(b) of the Migration Act 1958 , to hear the application before it dated 18 October 2007 and lodged with the AAT on 1 November 2007.

 

15 Questions (i) and (ii) are aspects of question (iii).
Did the notice comply with subpara 501G(1)(f)(iv) of the Act?

 
16 The letter that was delivered by hand to Mr Pomare on 17 October 2007 enclosed various documents, one of which was headed "INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEW RIGHTS FOR VISAS CANCELLED UNDER SECTION 501 OF THE MIGRATION ACT 1958 ".
The first paragraph in that document stated:
 The decision to cancel your visa under s501 of the Migration Act can be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) if the decision was made by a delegate of the Minister of the [sic] Immigration  Citizenship.
