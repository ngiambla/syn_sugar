2 On 5, 6 and 7 March 2007 the Tribunal heard two applications by the applicant, George Jovanovski, for review of decisions made by the respondent, Telstra Corporation Limited (Telstra), pursuant to the Act, together.
3 The first was a review decision (made on 15 November 2005) which affirmed a decision of the primary delegate as follows:
 Since 1 September 2005 and as at the present date, the condition that occurred on 4 December 1990 for which liability has been accepted for "lumbar disc lesion-exacerbation of previous injury ('1990 injury") has no longer resulted in incapacity for work or the need for medical treatment.
