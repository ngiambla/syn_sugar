 
1 The applicant Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd (Cadbury) has brought this proceeding against the respondent Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (Darrell Lea) alleging that the use by Darrell Lea of a shade of the colour purple in connection with its chocolate confectionery business amounted to the tort of passing off and also misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of ss 52 and 53 (c) and (d) of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
2 I found in favour of Darrell Lea: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 69 IPR 23 (the earlier judgment).
Subsequently the Full Court upheld Cadbury's appeal on the ground that I had wrongly excluded evidence sought to be adduced by Cadbury from three expert witnesses, Dr Brian Gibbs, Dr Constantino Stavros and Mr Timothy Riches (collectively, the Cadbury experts): Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 70 ; (2007) 72 IPR 261 ( Full Court I ).
3 Cadbury sought a new trial but their Honours at [114] directed that it be remitted to me for further hearing.
Their Honours observed at [128]:
 While there may well be cogent reasons for suspecting that, even with the disputed evidence, the result would have been the same, the Full Court cannot be confident that that is the case.
It is not possible, therefore, to conclude that there was no miscarriage of justice by reason of that error.
Accordingly, the appeal should be upheld, the orders of the primary judge should be set aside and there should be an order for the proceeding to be remitted to the primary judge for further trial.
4 Cadbury brought a motion to the Full Court seeking an order that the previous order remitting the matter to the trial judge for further hearing be varied to provide that the matter be remitted to the trial judge for a new trial: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102 ( Full Court II ).
In rejecting Cadbury's motion the Full Court said:
 4 We do not understand Cadbury to be suggesting that an order remitting the matter to the primary judge for a further hearing was not open to the Court.
Cadbury's motion appears to have been prompted by a directions hearing before the primary judge on 12 June 2007 during which his Honour indicated his understanding that the effect of the Full Court's order was that there would be a further hearing at which the excluded evidence would be adduced, but that that would be the extent of the further hearing.
It would seem that that was not Cadbury's understanding of the effect of the Full Court's order of 21 May 2007.
5 It is clear that Cadbury sought a new trial as part of the relief claimed in the appeal.
On the hearing of the appeal, one of the issues was whether, even if there had been an error on the part of the primary judge in excluding evidence there was nevertheless no miscarriage of justice and the orders made by the primary judge should therefore stand.
The Full Court rejected that contention.
The Court concluded that it could not be said that the disputed evidence was of so little weight that it could not influence the result of a new trial, so as to produce a different result (at [111]).
6 However, the Court did not consider that a new trial was justified.
Rather, the Court was of the view that justice would be served by a further hearing before the primary judge, at which Cadbury would have another opportunity of adducing the disputed evidence.
7 The proceeding was remitted on the basis that it would be before the primary judge as though the case were part heard.
Thus, it would be a matter for the primary judge to determine the extent to which, after entertaining all proper objections and making rulings on such objections, additional or further evidence should be admitted.
That may have the consequence that Darrell Lea would seek to adduce its own evidence in response to the disputed evidence.
8 We indicated in our reasons (at [110]) that, if proper objections were taken to the disputed evidence at the further hearing and the evidence was rejected, it would be open to the primary judge to allow Cadbury to elicit further evidence to overcome the objections.
That would be an aspect of the management of the further hearing by the primary judge in the same way as it would have been had his Honour not rejected the disputed evidence in its entirety.
That is to say, it would be for counsel for Darrell Lea to make such objections to the admissibility of the disputed evidence on formal grounds as they may consider appropriate.
If, in the exercise of his discretion, the primary judge were to permit Cadbury the opportunity of adducing further evidence to overcome any objections, that would be a matter entirely for his Honour at the further hearing.
9 It is conceivable that, after hearing proper objections from Darrell Lea, none of the disputed evidence will be admitted.
We do not, by that comment, indicate any view about the outcome of any objections one way or the other, except to the extent that we indicated the principles to be applied in our reasons of 21 May 2007.
It is, of course, conceivable, and we make no comment one way or the other as to whether it is likely, that is Honour would still reject the disputed evidence under s 135 of the Evidence Act .
That is entirely a matter for the primary judge.
10 Further, there would be no reason why the primary judge should entertain any contention that he should reverse earlier rulings made by him that were not in any way dependant upon the rejection of the disputed evidence.
His Honour should be in a position to conduct the further hearing as though he had admitted such of the disputed evidence as his Honour finds to be admissible after considering appropriate objections.
11 In so far as we referred to "a further trial" (at [129]) or "the new trial judge" (at [130]) we should be understood as having referred to a further hearing by the primary judge along those lines.
As we said (at [114]): 
 
 In the circumstances, there is no reason why the proceeding should not be remitted to the primary judge for further hearing.
Of course, if the primary judge were prepared to entertain a submission that he would not be able to bring an open mind to the resolution of the proceeding in the light of his Honour's earlier rulings both on the disputed evidence and in the final decision, it would be a matter for his Honour to decide whether he considered it was appropriate for the proceeding to be referred to another judge for a retrial ab initio.

 
 12 Similarly, if the primary judge were persuaded that the conduct of the hearing to date was such that the admission of any part of the disputed evidence that his Honour was disposed to admit would cause injustice, it would be a matter for his Honour as to whether the trial should, for that reason, be aborted.
The primary judge should be regarded as being in the same position as he would have been in had he not made the ruling of 31 March 2006.
It is clear from the context that the term "rulings" in [10] is a reference to rulings on evidence and procedure and not substantive findings, as to which see [11]-[12] below.
5 Cadbury applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the Full Court's remission of the matter to the primary judge.
The application was refused: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2007] HCATrans 468.
6 After hearing further argument the Full Court made orders in relation to costs of the appeal: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCAFC 119 ( Full Court III ).
The Full Court ordered that Darrell Lea pay Cadbury's costs other than its costs of and associated with grounds 1-14 inclusive, 17 and 18 of the amended notice of appeal, and that Cadbury pay Darrell Lea's costs of and associated with those grounds.
7 Their Honours in Full Court III noted at [8] that at the hearing of the appeal some grounds of the amended notice of appeal were abandoned by Cadbury, namely grounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 17 and 18, and that grounds 1, 2, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which raised challenges to substantive findings of the trial judge, were pressed only formally at the hearing of the appeal and were rejected by the Court.
8 On the further hearing Cadbury called its three experts and they were cross-examined by senior counsel for Darrell Lea.
Darrell Lea had filed an affidavit by an expert in the same area, a Mr Hall, but did not read his affidavit.
Nature and purpose of the present hearing 
 
9 Against that background, an initial question has been raised as to the findings made in the earlier judgment under the heading Summary of Findings at [95] to [112] as follows (I have added cross-references indicating grounds in Cadbury's amended notice of appeal which challenge the finding or seek a different finding on the same topic): 
 95 The evidence warrants the following findings.
96 There is wide awareness amongst Australian consumers of the use by Cadbury of a dark purple colour (i) in connection with the marketing, packaging and presentation of certain chocolate products particularly Cadbury Dairy Milk and other block milk chocolate products, and (ii) as a corporate colour.
[Grounds 1, 2] 97 Cadbury does not have an exclusive reputation in the use of this dark purple colour in connection with chocolate.
Other traders have, with Cadbury's knowledge, for many years used a similar shade of purple.
Cadbury has not consistently enforced its alleged exclusive reputation.
In relation to its chief competitor Nestl, Cadbury has, for its own commercial reasons, permitted a use of purple in relation to popular chocolate products.
[Grounds 1, 2] 98 Cadbury markets many chocolate products which have little or no purple in their packaging.
99 Cadbury products, regardless of the presence or absence of purple in the packaging, always bear the Cadbury name in a distinctive script.
[Ground 2] 100 Cadbury's use of purple in marketing advertising and promotion is, and is seen by consumers to be, inextricably bound up with the well known name Cadbury in its distinctive script.
Cadbury never uses the colour purple in isolation as an indicium of trade.
[Ground 2] 101 Cadbury products, with insignificant exceptions, are not sold at retail level at premises owned or occupied by Cadbury.
[Grounds 6, 7, 8] 102 Cadbury's marketing of chocolate heavily emphasises specific products and in particular Cadbury Dairy Milk block chocolate.
[Ground 8] 103 Darrell Lea is a name well known in connection with chocolate in those parts of Australia where it operates, even though not as well known as Cadbury.
[Ground 10] 104 The names Darrell Lea and Cadbury are quite distinct in sound and appearance (especially with the respective scripts the parties have adopted) and not likely to be mistaken for each other.
[Grounds 10, 11, 12] 105 Darrell has since at least Christmas 2000 used in its marketing, packaging, promotion and point of sale presentation a purple colour much like that used by Cadbury.
There has been particular use at Christmas 2000 to 2004 inclusive and also uses at other times.
Such usage has diminished and purple has been to a significant extent replaced by blue since 2004.
[Ground 12] 106 Darrell Lea did not adopt the colour purple with the intention of leading consumers to believe its products were Cadbury products or that it, or its products, had some kind of association with Cadbury.
[Grounds 3, 4, 5] 107 Most of Darrell Lea's retailing occurs in premises which it owns or occupies.
Other retailing occurs from separate stands or displays in retail premises, such as newsagents, pharmacies, convenience stores and video stores.
Darrell Lea has only a minor presence in supermarkets and only, in the past, to a very limited and transient extent in the major chains.
Its products are not presented for sale in close proximity to Cadbury's.
[Grounds 6, 7, 8] 108 Darrell Lea's marketing gives less emphasis to particular products than does Cadbury.
[Grounds 8, 10, 11, 12] 109 Darrell Lea does not sell moulded block chocolate.
[Grounds 10, 11, 12] 110 Darrell Lea uses its name in a distinctive script widely and consistently in marketing, packaging and point of sale presentation.
[Grounds 10, 11, 12] 111 Colour recognition or attraction can play an important part in consumer decisions to purchase chocolate.
[Ground 9] 112 Consumer decisions to purchase chocolate are often made quickly and on impulse but not necessarily irrationally.
Price and brand recognition can play an important part.
[Ground 9] 

 
10 After analysing Cadbury's case I reached the following conclusions (again, references to the grounds in the amended notice of appeal are inserted):
 121 The findings above lead to these conclusions.
Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names.
[Grounds 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] They have distinct identities in the market place.
[Grounds 11, 12] Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate.
Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury.
I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur.
11 Since the order I made dismissing Cadbury's application was set aside, the findings at [95]-[112] and [121] have no legal binding effect.
Nor do they create any presumptions.
I do not use the term "findings" to suggest the contrary.
However, it is clear from the repeated orders of the Full Court that there was not to be a new trial and the further evidence was to be limited to the three Cadbury experts and such opposing experts as Darrell Lea wished to call.
Some of the findings could be the subject of rejection or modification (or enhancement) in the light of the evidence given by Cadbury's experts, or indeed evidence given at the earlier hearing, eg [96], [97], [100], [111] and [112].
Most of the findings, however, are findings of primary fact.
12 The findings should be regarded for present purposes as tentative or provisional.
As directed by the Full Court, the trial is to be treated as continuing.
Not infrequently a judge will indicate that he or she has reached tentative conclusions and states them for the benefit of counsel.
The findings in the earlier judgment will be treated on the same basis, as an analytical framework.
Of course, this does not exclude the possibility of further findings which may be warranted by the evidence of the Cadbury experts or evidence given at the earlier hearing.
I now turn to summarise the evidence of the Cadbury experts.

14 His two affidavits extend over 90 pages, including exhibits.
The thrust of his evidence is summarized in an "Executive Summary" at pars 28-31 of his first affidavit as follows.
(Emphasis in original.
Definitions provided elsewhere in the first affidavit are summarized and indicated in brackets.
)
 28 Cadbury, the leading brand in chocolate confectionery in Australia, has deliberately and consistently used the colour Cadbury purple as a key branding element for its Cadbury Dairy Milk brand and its corporate Cadbury brand since at least the late 1980s.
As a result, the colour purple is strongly associated with the Cadbury brand.
Purple signifies the brand to consumers, and can trigger the rich set of tangible and intangible but meaningful brand judgments, attitudes, concepts, and feelings that are associated with the Cadbury brand in the mind of the consumer.
In this sense, purple is an activator of Cadbury's brand equity, and so is a brand element of considerable value to Cadbury.
29 Darrell Lea has recently made significant use of purple in relation to packaging and point of sale displays, at the same time as it has focused on a new distribution strategy that goes beyond its traditional dedicated shops and seeks to take advantage of "convenience" distribution channels.
30 In my opinion, Darrell Lea's use of purple is likely to cause four information-processing errors to occur among consumers of chocolate confectionery, and these errors are likely to cause harm to Cadbury.
Misidentification and miscuing are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer choice; misinference and misassociation are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer judgment.

 
 30.1 Misidentification is when consumers seeking to buy Cadbury chocolate mistakenly identify a Darrell Lea product as a Cadbury product, and therefore buy the Darrell Lea product by mistake.
Harm to Cadbury from misidentification can take the form of sales lost to Darrell Lea, induced "trailing" of Darrell Lea's products, blame from consumers for the confusing common use of colour by the two brands, and damaged consumer attitudes toward Cadbury due to cognitive dissonance [a state of discomfort produced by inconsistencies between simultaneously held beliefs or between beliefs and behaviour] or due to violated expectations.
Although misidentification is the most obvious of the consumer errors likely to be experienced by reason of Darrell Lea's conduct, I believe it is the least significant, all things considered.
30.2 Miscuing is when consumers use purple as a spurious cue in decision making and choice; in this capacity the colour can function as a decision-heuristic [a shorthand decision rule or "rule of thumb" functioning to reduce decision-making effort while maintaining an adequate level of accuracy] cue, an operant-conditioning [a form of learning in which modification of behaviour is brought about by the consequences that followed upon the occurrence of the behaviour in the past (for example, reward)] cue, or a behaviour-instigating cue.
Harm to Cadbury from miscuing takes the form of sales lost to Darrell Lea.
30.3 Misinference is when consumers, in trying to make sense of the common use of purple by Darrell Lea and Cadbury, draw mistaken inferences about one or both of the brands.
Harm to Cadbury from misinference can take the form of enhanced consumer attitudes towards its competitor Darrell Lea, reduced brand control by Cadbury, and perhaps, damaged consumer attitudes toward Cadbury.
30.4 Misassociation is when consumers mistakenly link Cadbury brand associations with Darrell Lea, and vice versa, as a result of the two brands' associative networks [a framework for understanding how pieces of semantic information interact in an individual's memory in which concepts or other information stored in memory are represented by nodes that are interconnected in a network of links] having become connected in consumers' minds through the common use of purple.
Harm to Cadbury from misassociation can take the form of reduced mean positivity of Cadbury associations, dilution of the Cadbury brand, reduced differentiation between Cadbury and Darrell Lea, reduced brand control by Cadbury, a strengthening of Darrell Lea's brand, and perhaps, emboldened competitors in general.
All things considered, I believe misassociation is the most significant of the consumer errors likely to be experienced by reason of Darrell Lea's conduct.

 
 31 In my opinion, Darrell Lea's use of purple has two additional types of effect, and these effects are also likely to cause harm to Cadbury.

 
 31.1 Errors analogous to the judgement errors (misinference and misassociation) that are made by consumers may likewise be made by retailers, investors, and Cadbury employees.
Harm to Cadbury from these errors may take the form of reduced Cadbury reputation and leverage in the distribution channel (retailers), reduced valuations of the Cadbury brand (investors), and reduced morale in the Cadbury workforce (employees).
31.2 The use of purple by Darrell Lea is likely to reduce the perceptual distinctiveness of Cadbury products, and this may also cause harm to Cadbury in the form of lost sales.

 


A number of detailed sections followed the Executive Summary.
The following summary is taken from Full Court I at [22] et seq.
22 First, the affidavit dealt with general marketing concepts and theories under five headings.
It is desirable to summarise what Dr Gibbs said about them.
1.
The brand concept and brand equity: 23 In contemporary marketing theory and practice a brand is understood to be an essentially psychological entity.
A brand is a set of associations in the mind of the consumer.
The importance and value of a brand to its owner lies in the ability of this mentally held set of associations to influence consumer behaviour, especially information processing associated with product perception, evaluation and choice.
Consumers often buy the brand rather than the product itself.
The brand transcends the product in that extra dimensions have been added to the core product in order to differentiate it from other products designed to satisfy the same needs.
Such differentiation may be based on tangible, rational differences related to product performance or on intangible differences of an emotional or symbolic nature related to what the brand represents.
A brand can be highly valuable to its owners.
The notion of the value attributable to a brand is captured by the concept of brand equity.
2.
Nature and storage of brand associations in memory: 24 An essential function of memory is to draw together similar experiences to enable one to discover patterns in one's interactions with the environment.
Thus, memory serves to make current perceptions meaningful by relating them to knowledge that has been distilled from previous experiences.
In the field of consumer behaviour, the issue of how brand associations are stored in the minds of consumers and accessed by them, as they form judgments and make decisions, is typically understood in terms of "the associative-network model of memory".
That type of model has a long history in psychology.
On that model, a brand is conceptualised as a set of nodes that represent concepts or other information stored in memory and are interconnected in a network of links.
This network of nodes in memory can include a wide variety of brand associations, which are created through actual use of the branded product or through exposure to advertising or other marketing.
Those networked associations comprise all the explicit or implicit pieces of knowledge that the consumer retains about the brand.
25 Brand associations are formed in the mind of a consumer through a process of learning.
However, not all such consumer learning is conscious.
A key feature of associative-network models is the concept of spreading activation.
Nodes vary in their activation levels, with some nodes having more activation and others having less at any given moment.
A node is activated when the consumer perceives a stimulus or cue corresponding to that node.
The extent to which activation spreads between two nodes depends on how closely they are linked in the associative network.
