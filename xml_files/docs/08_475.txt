 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant ("Mr Patankar"), a citizen of India, is a qualified architect who is additionally skilled in information technology ("IT").
In May 2001 Mr Patankar was granted a subclass 457 visa.
In February 2003 he was granted a fresh subclass 457 visa.
At the time that he received the second of these visas he was advised by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ("DIMIA") that if he wished to change his employer he was required to apply for a new subclass 457 visa.
2 In June 2003 Mr Patankar became an employee in Australia of the first respondent ("Excom") in circumstances that are in dispute but which resulted in a breach of the conditions of his visa.
3 In this proceeding Mr Patankar makes claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA"), in the tort of negligent misstatement and for breach of contract for damage allegedly suffered by him as a result of the breach of the conditions of his visa.
It is not in dispute that Mr Patankar has not held a visa authorising him to work in Australia since, at the latest, August 2003.
BACKGROUND FACTS 
 
4 Mr Patankar spent approximately six months in Australia in 1998, and again in 2000, on each occasion having entered Australia on a tourist visa.
On 14 May 2001 he received advice from the Australian Consulate General in Mumbai, India, that he had been granted a subclass 457 visa which permitted him to travel to, enter and remain in, Australia until 14 May 2005.
He was further advised that his visa was subject to the condition that "[t]he holder must not change employer or occupation in Australia without the permission in writing of the Secretary" (visa condition 8107).
The employer who had sponsored Mr Patankar for the purpose of his subclass 457 visa was Educom Australia (Educom).
5 In late 2002 Educom went into administration and Mr Patankar was made redundant.
In early 2003 he approached Consultants Exchange Australasia Pty Limited ("CXC") to become his work visa sponsors.
CXC was approved by the DIMIA as a subclass 457 visa sponsor.
