This case is about whether such a symbol, when lawfully embroidered overseas into the external surface of an article of clothing, is protected by copyright within the provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) so that it may not be imported for sale or sold in Australia without the consent of the person entitled to the copyright here.
2 The Polo/Lauren Company L.P. is currently the assignee of the copyright in a well-known artistic work made in 1971 by an Italian citizen, Athos Dell Torre.
He produced a representation of a polo player swinging his mallet while astride a polo pony which is mobile, apparently cantering.
This representation was first published in the United States of America in 1972.
Since then it has been a feature which has appeared on many articles manufactured by companies associated with the names 'Polo Ralph Lauren' or one or more of them.
It is common ground that the polo player logo has become a well-known trade mark associated with goods made by the design or fashion house associated with the names Polo Ralph Lauren (cf: s 120(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth)).
I will refer to this artistic work and the version of it which is embroidered on clothing as 'the polo player logo'.
3 Since 1971 copyright in the polo player logo has been assigned on a number of occasions among the group of companies associated with the brand names of Ralph Lauren and Polo Ralph Lauren.
4 These proceedings concern the question whether Ziliani Holdings Pty Ltd and its principal, Adam Ziliani, infringed the copyright of Polo/Lauren by importing into Australia and then displaying and selling a number of articles of clothing with the polo player logo embroidered on them in two shops in Chatswood, a Sydney suburb.
It is common ground that Ziliani did not have the licence or consent of Polo/Lauren to import those articles into Australia or to engage in the activity of selling them here.
Mr Ziliani accepts that if Ziliani Holdings is found liable for infringing Polo/Lauren's copyright in breach of ss 37 or 38 , he too will be liable.
Unless it is necessary to distinguish them, I will refer to both respondents as 'Ziliani' in these reasons.
5 Each of the articles imported by Ziliani was genuine, rather than counterfeit.
It had been manufactured in the country of manufacture with the licence of the owner of the copyright in the polo player logo and then was lawfully imported into or displayed for sale in the United States of America where it was sold to Ziliani Holdings.
The question here is whether the sales to and purchases by Ziliani Holdings in the United States of America entitled it to engage in 'parallel importing' of those goods into Australia: ie importing them without the licence of Polo/Lauren as the Australian licensee of the polo player logo.
It is common ground that in the absence of a licence from Polo/Lauren and a defence under the Act, Ziliani would infringe any copyright in the polo player logo by importing the goods here or then trading with them: Interstate Parcel Express Co Pty Ltd v Time-Life International (Nederlands) BV [1977] HCA 52 ; (1977) 138 CLR 534.
6 Polo/Lauren claimed that Ziliani has infringed its copyright in the polo player logo here on two bases when it appeared embroidered on an article.
7 First, Polo/Lauren argued that Ziliani, from the time of their first act of importation, infringed its copyright in breach of s 37 of the Copyright Act by importing into Australia without Polo/Lauren's licence or consent each article of clothing on which the polo player logo was embroidered for the purpose of selling it by retail.
Alternatively, it argued that, at least since the time Polo/Lauren or its predecessor made known to Ziliani its claim of infringement of its copyright in June 2006, Ziliani continued their importations and display for sale with knowledge of the breach of copyright.
Ziliani accepted that if their defences failed they were liable on that latter basis.
8 Secondly, Polo/Lauren argued that Ziliani had infringed its copyright in breach of s 38 of the Act by selling or offering for sale each imported article on which the polo player logo appeared embroidered.
9 Ziliani raised two defences under the Act.
They contended that the polo player logo embroidered on each article:
 
 
 (a) amounted to a non-infringing accessory within the meaning of the exception to infringement in s 44C of the Act, because it is a 'label' embroidered onto an article of clothing;
 (b) as applied to the clothing, was a 'corresponding design', which s 77 of the Act authorised may be reproduced without infringing copyright in the original artistic work.

 

10 Not all goods produced by the Ralph Lauren group have the polo player logo embroidered on them; on some it is printed, on others embossed, and on some it does not appear at all.
Designers in the Ralph Lauren group select which articles will bear the polo player logo.
These proceedings concern only the use of the polo player logo when it has been embroidered onto an article.
Polo/Lauren argued that the polo player logo was not a 'corresponding design' or a label.
It contended that it was a decorative feature of articles on which it was placed.
