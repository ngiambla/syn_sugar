 
1 The issue for determination in this proceeding is the assessment of the appropriate penalty, if any, to be imposed on the respondents for breaching s 187AB of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (as it applied prior to 27 March 2006) ("the Act ").
2 Section 187AB prohibits an organisation, or an officer, member or employee of an organisation, from making a claim for an employer to make a payment to an employee in relation to a period during which the employee engaged, or engages, in industrial action; see s 187AB(1)(a).
It also prohibits the organising or engagement in, or threats to organise or engage in, industrial action against an employer with intent to coerce the employer to make such a payment; see s 187AB(1)(b).
3 The events the subject of this proceeding occurred in May 2004.
At that time the maximum penalty for breach of s 187AB was $10,000 for a corporation and $2,000 for an individual.
The Parties 
 
4 The applicant, Mr Christopher James Cahill, is an inspector appointed under s 84 of the Act and an Australian Building and Construction Inspector appointed under s 57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth).
It is not in dispute that he is entitled to bring the current proceeding.
5 The first respondent, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union ("CFMEU") is an organisation of employees registered under the Act .
It is, by reason of its registration, a body corporate.
The second respondent, Mr John Setka, was, at all material times, employed by the CFMEU as an organiser with the Victorian Branch of its Construction Division.
The third respondent, Mr Alex Tadic, was, at all material times, employed by Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd ("Bovis").
He was also a member of the CFMEU and a delegate or shop steward representing members of the CFMEU employed by Bovis.
Bovis 
 
6 Between December 2003 and about December 2005, Bovis was the principal contractor on the redevelopment of the Herald and Weekly Times building on the corner of Flinders and Exhibition Streets in Melbourne ("the site").
Bovis engaged employees to perform work on the site.
Those employees included some who were members of the CFMEU.
A safety issue 
 
7 On the afternoon of 10 May 2004, during a concrete pour into formwork for a wall near a corner of the core building on the site, a concrete spill occurred in the immediate vicinity of the wall formwork.
The spill caused an imminent risk to health and safety in that part of the site where it occurred.
Approximately 12 tonnes of concrete was spilled.
8 On 11 May 2004 a Worksafe inspector inspected the site.
His report states:
 During a pour on the Monday afternoon, one of the shutters on the western face of Level 11 was found to be misaligned, resulting in concrete pouring onto the lower level of the protection deck.
It is estimated approximately 4-6 meters (approx.
12 tonnes) of concrete fell onto the deck.
The pour was immediately ceased.
No one was injured.
The report noted that rectification work had commenced and that "(w)ork at the site has ceased pending rectification.
"
 
9 There had been other safety concerns at the site.
In March 2003, a safety issue arose concerning the presence of lead paint fragments becoming airborne during demolition of the old building.
In January 2004, an issue arose concerning the presence of asbestos in lifts in the then existing building.
The events of 11 May 2004 
 
10 At 7.00 am on 11 May 2004, CFMEU members and other workers employed at the site were due to commence work.
The workers refused to start work and remained in the sheds.
Instead, at that time, a meeting occurred.
It was attended by representatives from Bovis and various union delegates and occupational, health and safety representatives.
11 At the meeting, representatives of Bovis said that the affected area could be isolated and workers relocated to other areas on the site.
While the spill was investigated, they suggested work could continue on the rest of the site.
Mr Tadic, together with another or other union delegates, suggested that the workers on site should go home for the day while a small clean up crew remained on the site.
12 At about 8.15 am a representative of Bovis told CFMEU members that the spill would be isolated by barricades.
He then directed the members to commence a general site clean up before working as usual in all other areas of the site.
13 At about 8.30 am, all delegates and safety representatives, including Mr Tadic, held a meeting with all workers on the site.
After the meeting, at about 9.30 am, all the workers on the site commenced a 48 hour stoppage of work.
The events of 13 May 2004 
 
14 At about 9.30 am on 13 May 2004, the workers returned to the site but remained in the sheds.
At about 10.00 am, Mr Setka and Mr Tadic asked Bovis to pay CFMEU members for time lost during the two day stoppage.
Bovis rejected that request.
Mr Setka and Mr Tadic then said that workers on the site, including CFMEU members, would not return to work.
15 At about 2.00 pm, Mr Setka and Mr Tadic again requested Bovis to pay CFMEU members for the stoppage period and also for the subsequent period during which the members refused to return to work.
Bovis again refused.
16 At about 3.00 pm, Mr Setka and Mr Tadic told the workers on site that they should leave the site, prior to the usual 3.30 pm finish time, and when they returned in the morning they should stay in the sheds.
The events of 14 May 2004 
 
17 At about 6.00 am on 14 May 2004, Mr Setka again asked Bovis to pay CFMEU members for the 48 hour stoppage and the subsequent period during which Bovis employees refused to return to work.
Bovis representatives showed Mr Setka a document concerning the planned rectification work and said that while that work was carried out, the workers could return to work on the remainder of the site.
Mr Setka was not swayed.
18 At 7.00 am, the workers arrived at the site but remained in the sheds.
From about 8.00 am to 8.15 am, Mr Setka, Mr Tadic and various union and safety representatives held a meeting with the workers on the site.
Immediately after the meeting, all workers began to leave the site.
As this occurred, at about 8.30 am, either Mr Setka or Mr Tadic, or both of them, told representatives of Bovis that the workers on the site had withdrawn their labour until 7.00 am on Tuesday 18 May 2004, and that they would not commence work on that day unless they were paid wages for the period 11 to 15 May 2004.
In the same conversation it was also said that "action" would start to affect other Bovis sites in Victoria.
19 At about 11.00 am, two employees of Bovis, and site delegates for the CFMEU at another construction site ("the Melbourne Central site"), told the Bovis foreman at the Melbourne Central site that there would "be trouble at the Melbourne Central site unless the issues at the Herald and Weekly Times site were fixed.
"
 
20 At about 1.30 pm, at another site at 385 Bourke Street, Melbourne in which Bovis was also engaged, Bovis employees banned induction training, mobile cranes and work with villaboard material.
21 At about 2.40 pm, Bovis made an application in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission pursuant to s 127 of the Act with a view to stopping the industrial action.
That proceeding was adjourned at 3.54 pm.
Subsequent events 
 
22 Although Saturday 15 May 2004 was a normal working day, no CFMEU members attended the site.
Monday 17 May 2004 was a rostered day off.
23 At about 7.00 am on 18 May 2004, the workers employed at the site returned to work but remained in the sheds.
During that morning, between 7.00 am and 8.15 am, Bovis and the CFMEU, and other unions with members on the site, resolved the dispute on the basis that Bovis would pay the workers for ten hours.
