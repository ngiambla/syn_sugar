1 The applicants Black  Decker Inc, a United States corporation, and its wholly owned Australian subsidiary Black  Decker (Australia) Pty Ltd claim that the respondent GMCA Pty Ltd has infringed their intellectual property rights conferred by Australian Standard Patent No 757412 (the Standard Patent), Australian Innovation Patent No 2002 100583 (the Innovation Patent) and Australian Registered Design No 144505 (the Design).
2 The priority date of both Patents is 18 December 1998 and that of the Design 9 November 1999.
3 The relevant claims of the Patents are for a power saw and the Design is for a blade to be used in such a saw.
4 The power saw of Black  Decker's alleged invention is a reciprocating (backwards and forwards) electrically powered tool.
By changing the blade the saw may be used either as a panel saw or a jigsaw.
The specification in the Standard Patent show the preferred embodiment used as a panel saw (Figure 12) or jigsaw (Figure 13) as follows:
 
 
 
5 In its traditional manual form a panel saw has a long deep blade with a handle at the rear.
Usually the blade decreases in depth towards the front of the saw, which has a blunt end.
A panel saw is operated by moving the saw in a back and forth motion at about a 45 degree angle to the top of the workpiece.
The saw cuts on the push stroke.
6 As at December 1998 portable panel saws powered by an electric motor were well known.
7 A jigsaw is a portable power tool.
It is used for accurate or fine cutting both in straight lines and curves (including tight or intricate curves) in timber, metals or other materials.
In order to be able to cut tight curves jigsaw blades are usually narrower than panel saw blades.
A jigsaw blade operates in an up-and-down motion with the teeth of the blade pointing away from the user, both for safety and general ease of use.
A jigsaw usually has a flat support surface, often in the form of a fixed plate or shoe, so that the jigsaw can be pushed firmly on to the top of the workpiece.
Jigsaws as described were known at the priority date.
8 As well as disputes concerning validity and infringement in relation to the Patents and the Design, there is an issue as to the standing of the second applicant.
This latter issue turns on the validity and effect of certain transactions between the two applicants.
2.0 THE STANDARD PATENT 
 2.1 Specification and claims 
 
9 The specification states that the invention "relates to a power tool and has particular, although not exclusive, relevance to such power tools which are able to have their modes of operation changed".
10 It is noted that some power tools are capable of operating in more than one mode, such as a power drill which may also be used as a screwdriver.
Conventionally such tools which operate in more than one mode are held by the user in the same position or orientation relative to the workpiece.
It is said that a power tool capable of operating in one mode as a panel saw and in another mode as a jigsaw, yet being held and operated by a user differently dependent upon which of these two options is required, would be "a very flexible proposition".
An object of the invention is said to be to provide a power tool with greater flexibility and utility.
The consistory clause is as follows:
 Accordingly, the present invention provides a power tool having a linear reciprocating output, including a body housing a motor for driving the power tool, the body including a fixed handle to allow a user to manually hold and operate the power tool; a trigger positioned adjacent the handle wherein the handle is positioned relative to the body such that a user may operate the power tool in a plurality of positions relative to a workpiece in order to perform a different power tool function in each of said plurality of positions; characterized in that the handle is accessible from more than one side, each accessible side corresponding to a given one of the plurality of different positions and wherein the trigger being operable by a user when gripping the handle in each of said plurality of positions and wherein the handle is positioned such that a force applied thereto by the user in a first of said plurality of positions comprises a major vector transmitted along a line of action extending substantially parallel to the line of linear reciprocation, and a force applied thereto by the user in a second of said plurality of positions comprises a major vector transmitted along a line of action extending substantially transverse to the line of linear reciprocation.
Because the handle is accessible from more than one side, then the tool may be used in a different attitude and orientation to a workpiece dependent upon the task to be undertaken.
11 It would seem that the last sentence of the passage just quoted encapsulates the inventive step.
As put by senior counsel for Black  Decker, "(a)n important aspect of the power tool of the invention is the design and position of the handle so as to enable it to be gripped by the user comfortably and safely in either orientation whether the tool is acting as a panel saw or jigsaw".
12 There then follows a description of various drawings of parts of the preferred embodiment, including mountings of the saw blade.
However, the invention is not said to lie in the internal mechanics by which different blades may be fitted to the device.
13 The specification describes in some detail the operation of preferred embodiments in Figures 12 and 13.
They share the same body but are used for a different purpose and operate in different modes.
As to Figure 12, it is said that it has been found desirable to offer the user the facility of using the panel saw "not only in its powered mode but also manually".
The specification continues:
 ...the user should be able to grip the handle (38) of the panel saw and use it as a conventional manually operated saw whether the blade is being driven by the motor (24) or not.
To achieve this the saw needs to be lightweight but also it has been found that, when the saw is being driven by the motor (24), conventional reciprocating action will prevent manually using the tool with ease, because of the combination of the frequency of reciprocation of the saw blade (12) and the length of each reciprocal stroke.
14 There is some discussion of the preferable frequency of reciprocation which is said to be 6,500 strokes per minute and length of each reciprocal stroke of around 10 mm.
Nevertheless, the invention can be operated effectively with a frequency of vibration between 3,000 and 10,000 strokes per minute and works effectively within a range of 5 to 15 mm.
 
15 Referring to Figure 13, the same body with a different blade, it is said the saw blade (12) "is that found on conventional 'jigsaws'".
The specification continues: 
 Conventionally, jigsaws are held relative to the workpiece in a different attitude to panel saws.
This can be seen by reference to the difference in attitude between Figure 12 and 13.
In Figure 13, the body (36) can be seen resting on a block (42) which represents a workpiece.
In use of the jigsaw, the body (36) would be held on the block (42) in the attitude shown in Figure 13.
It can be seen from Figure 13 that the handle (38) is now positioned relative to the workpiece (42) such that the body (36) may easily be used as a jigsaw.
In use of the jigsaw, a user exerts a force via the handle (38) in the direction of the large arrow marked "A".
This is so that the blade (12) is driven also in the direction of the arrow "A" to cut through the workpiece.
It can be seen by comparing Figures 12 and 13, that the handle (38), although itself the same in both figures, it [sic] able to be used for exerting forces in a different direction depending on which mode of use (either the panel saw of Figure 12 or the jigsaw of Figure 13) the tools are put to.
The handle (38) is positioned adjacent a trigger (44) which trigger (44) is operable by user when the handle (38) is gripped.
It can be seen from both Figures 12 and 13, therefore, that the position of the handle (38) relative to the body (36) is such that the user may operate the saw in a plurality of positions relative to a workpiece.
Thus, regardless of whether the tool is being used as a panel saw in Figure 12 or a jigsaw in Figure 13, the same handle is used for operating the saw.
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that this holds true whether the panel saw of Figure 12 is being used as a powered saw by powering the motor (24) via an electricity supply cable (46), or whether it is being used manually.
... From Figures 12 and 13, therefore, it can be seem that the handle (38) is accessible from one of two sides, depending on whether the tool is to be used as a panel saw or as a jigsaw.
16 The claims of the invention are as follows, claim 6 being the one principally relied upon (the integer numbers inserted between square brackets are those agreed on by the parties): 
 1.
[1.1] A power tool having a linear reciprocating output, [1.2] including: a body housing a motor for driving the power tool, [1.3] the body including a fixed handle to allow a user to manually hold and operate the power tool; [1.4] a trigger positioned adjacent the handle [1.5] wherein the handle is positioned relative to the body such that a user may operate the power tool in a plurality of positions relative to a workpiece in order to perform a different power function in each of said plurality of positions; [1.6] characterized in that the handle is accessible from more than one side, [1.7] each accessible side corresponding to a given one of the plurality of different positions and wherein the trigger being operable by a user when gripping the handle in each of said plurality of positions [1.8] and wherein the handle is positioned such that a force applied thereto by the user in a first of said plurality of positions comprises a major vector transmitted along a line of action extending substantially parallel to the line of linear reciprocation, [1.9] and a force applied thereto by the user in a second of said plurality of positions comprises a major vector transmitted along a line of action extending substantially transverse to the line of linear reciprocation.
2.
[2.1] A power tool as claimed in claim 1 [2.2] wherein the body includes a second handle to which the user may apply a force when the tool is in said first position to apply a secondary force having a major vector in a direction substantially transverse to the line of linear reciprocation.

2.2 Construction 
 
17 The principle construction debate centred around the term "a major vector" in integers 1.8, 1.9 and 2.2 of the Standard Patent.
18 GMCA's case on this issue was not so much to assert a particular meaning for the term but rather to argue that it lacked any fixed or certain meaning with the result that claim 1 was not clear, as required by s 40(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth).
Senior counsel asked rhetorically: 
 What is the force applied by the user to the handle in panel saw mode to which reference is made?
In comparison with what other force or forces is the force which the user applies to the handle to be compared with to as 'a major vector'?
How large is the force meant to be?
19 GMCA's expert witness Dr Hugh Stark said that the actual forces acting on the saw when used in panel mode were complex, varied over time and could not be described as to direction and magnitude without experiment or calculation.
Also, Dr Stark said, given the cyclical nature of the sawing action both the direction and magnitude of the forces applied by the user to the handle would vary widely throughout the sawing cycle.
20 The relevant skilled addressee here is a person skilled in the design and manufacture of power tools.
The invention is for a product, albeit a product whose inventive feature is said to lie on its ability to be used in particular ways.
The skilled addressee is not a person whose connection with power tools is only in the capacity of a dealer or end user.
21 Claims must be construed in a practical, common sense manner, and are valid so long as they provide a workable standard suitable to the intended use: Minnesota Mining  Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Aust) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 at 273; Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56 at 95.
22 It is accepted that "a major vector" is not a technical engineering term.
According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, when used in mathematics "vector" is a "quantity having direction as well as magnitude, denoted by a line drawn from its original to its final position".
The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term, as used in mathematics, as "a quantity which possesses both magnitude and direction".
23 Black  Decker's witness Mr Richard Frost read the expression "a major vector" as requiring that "one of the significant or substantial forces... applied by the user to the handle of the power tool of the invention must be transmitted along the line of action set out in the claims".
Another Black  Decker witness, Professor John Redmond, helpfully explained the concept in diagrammatic form:
 
 

 
24 The term in question does not have the difficulty GMCA seeks to find in it.
The expression is a major vector, that is to say a vector which is substantial, or of significance, although not necessarily the most substantial.
No comparative identification and quantification of possible other vectors is required to understand what the inventor is endeavouring to convey.
The context here is relatively straightforward technology.
Anybody using a power saw has to apply some directional force to the handle.
It is a major force in the sense that it is substantial and necessary; were it not for that force the saw would not be presented to and held at the workpiece.
That force operates parallel to the backwards-and-forwards motion of plane sawing and transversely to the up-and-down motion of jigsawing.
Claim 1 is telling the reader that the saw of the invention is designed to be reoriented and gripped by the user when used to perform each of those different sawing operations.
GMCA's case on this issue is not made out.
2.3 Manner of manufacture 
 
25 The alleged invention, so far as claimed in any claim, must be a manner of manufacture within the meaning of s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies: Patents Act s 18(1)(a).
26 GMCA submitted that both patents were but an "attempt to re-design a known tool so as to achieve impermissibly, a patent monopoly over what is really a marketing idea".
The alleged invention, so the argument went, citing Maugham J in Adelmann  Ham Boiler Corporation v Llanrwst Foundry Co (1928) 45 RPC 413 at 420, was simply the application of a well known and well understood piece of mechanism to achieve an obvious advantage.
The mere "positioning" of the handle for a known tool in order to achieve a known result was not a manner of manufacture.
27 Much of this argument overlapped with GMCA's case on description, utility, novelty and obviousness.
To the extent that it did not, it must be rejected.
The alleged invention did not involve an abstract idea, like that considered in Grant v Commissioner of Patents (2006) 69 IPR 221.
It concerned machines and their operation and thus "something of a corporeal and substantial nature": R v Wheeler (1819) 2 B  Ald 345 at 350, cited in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] HCA 21 ; (2007) 72 IPR 447 at [66] ( Lockwood 2 ).
28 As the High Court said in Lockwood 2 at [65], "[i]ngenuity may lie in an idea for overcoming a practical difficulty in circumstances where a difficulty with a product consisting of a known set of integers is common general knowledge".
2.4 Description of the invention 
 
29 Section 40(2)(a) of the Patents Act requires the specification to describe the invention fully, including the best method known to the applicant of performing the invention.
30 GMCA say that the specification "does not explain how [counsel's emphasis] the major vector element contributes to the achievement of the invention (which is said to be a useful tool)".
Reliance was placed on a passage in Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274 at [99] ( Lockwood 1 ).
However, that passage is not in point.
It is in the context of a fair basing argument and says that a claim cast in the form of a consistory clause is not fairly based if other parts of the specification show that the invention is narrower than that consistory clause.
The inquiry, their Honours stress, is into what the body of the specification read as a whole discloses as the invention.
31 In any case, the specification does not put forward the "major vector element" as something "contribut(ing) to the achievement of the invention".
The invention is not for a method of holding a power saw; it is for a power saw capable of fulfilling different functions.
As already explained, the (perhaps overly scientific) term "vector" is but a word used in describing these two functions.
The specification contains quite detailed explanations and diagrams of the preferred embodiment.
There is no obligation on a patentee to describe more than a single preferred form of the invention.
The ground of insufficiency is not made out merely because it is said there are other ways of carrying out the invention as to which the specification is not sufficiently precise: No-Fume Ltd v Frank Pitchford  Co Ltd (1935) 52 RPC 231 at 248.
The test is whether the disclosure in the specification will "enable the addressee to produce something within each claim without new inventions or additions or prolonged study of matters presenting initial difficulty": Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [25] .
This requirement has been satisfied.
2.5 Fair basing 
 
32 The claims must be fairly based on the matter described in the specification: Patents Act s 40(3).
The body of the specification must provide a "real and reasonably clear disclosure" of the invention claimed: F Hoffman-La Roche  Co v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 at 539; Lockwood 1 at [69].
33 GMCA submits that the claims are not fairly based.
It says that the claims, in particular claim 1, are not limited to power saws but extend to all manner of power tools.
They do not include "essential features" in the specification, viz the reciprocation frequency and stroke length ranges.
They also refer to a "plurality" of positions whereas in fact there are only two.
34 Whatever may be the position in relation to claim 1, the claims from claim 3 onwards, and in particular the critical claim 6, are clearly confined to power saws.
35 The reciprocation frequency and stroke length ranges are matters of guidance for the skilled addressee.
They are not essential to the working of the claimed invention.
As Maugham LJ said in No-Fume at 248, the specification does not have to define
 ... all the proportions, or all the dimensions, or all the temperatures, or all the materials which would give a similar or like result.
36 The preferred embodiment makes it clear that only two uses are disclosed.
2.6 Utility 
 
37 The invention, so far is claimed in any claim, must be useful: Patents Act s 18(1)(c).
This means that the invention as claimed must produce the desired result.
38 GMCA's case on this ground was based on the supposed difficulty, or indeed impossibility, in identifying the "major vector".
This, so it was said, meant that it was impossible to identify "what is required in terms of the [sic] locating the handle or operating the tool".
39 There is no substance in this ground.
The alleged problems arising from the "major vector" term have already been discussed.
Plane sawing and jigsawing are well known modes of operating a power saw.
The preferred embodiment, and in particular Figures 12 and 13, make it clear how the device is to be constructed and how it would operate.
40 GMCA further relied on an experiment conducted by Dr Stark.
He placed a piece of timber in a vice and then suspended a saw (successively the Black  Decker product and GMCA's two allegedly infringing products) by a flexible piece of nylon cord attached to the handle where a user would grip it.
He turned on the power and applied adhesive tape to hold the trigger in the "ON" position.
With the saw blade then reciprocating he applied the blade to the timber while supporting the handle using only the flexible cord.
The saw in each case was able to cut through the timber purely by virtue of the downward force of the gravity on the body of the product.
The cord retained a vertical or near vertical orientation during the cutting process.
He concluded that "negligible horizontal force was being applied to the handle of the saw in the reciprocation direction during the cutting process".
The force required to cause the reciprocating blade to cut (ie gravity) was substantially transverse to the line of linear reciprocation.
41 I do not see how this experiment shows that a product of the invention was not able to produce the desired result, ie using the same saw, with a change of blade, as either a plane saw or a jigsaw.
In particular, normal use as a plane saw would not involve suspending the saw from a flexible nylon cord.
As senior counsel for Black  Decker put it, what the claims require is that "the tool be designed so that it includes a fixed handle which is configured and positioned so that the user can apply a relevant force through the handle appropriate to the intended use", whether as a panel saw or a jigsaw.
2.7 Novelty 
 
42 The invention must be novel as compared with the prior art base as it existed before the priority date: Patents Act s 18(1)(b)(i).
The question is whether the alleged anticipation contains each essential integer of the claim so as to amount to an infringement (the reverse infringement test).
43 In the case of an anticipation in documentary form, the document must contain "clear and unmistakable directions to do what the patentee claims to have invented": General Tire  Rubber Co v Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co Ltd [1972] RPC 457 at 486.
44 Although GMCA originally pleaded some 22 anticipations, by trial these had been reduced to 13.
In final submissions only seven were relied on.
The general comment can be made that although some of the devices could perhaps as a matter of physical possibility be used as a jigsaw there was no clear direction that this was their intended use.
2.7.1 Bosch PMS 400 
 
45 This device was in evidence and is also described in the Bosch 1993/94 Catalogue.
It is described as a "multisaw" and is pictured as being used in panel saw mode.
There are photographs of various blade accessories such as a rasp, file and various brushes and also the statement: "In addition, the Bosch jigsaw accessory range is available for the multisaw".
46 However there is no separate, fixed handle.
The user grasps the body of the tool itself, as one would a torch.
Essential integers of the claimed invention are thus missing.
I do not accept Dr Stark's argument that the body itself is a handle.
One would not speak of the handle of a torch.
The notion of a handle involves something separate jointed onto an object for ease of handling, as in the handle of a suitcase.
2.7.2 Bosch PFZ 550E 
 
47 This appeared in the same Catalogue.
It does have a handle.
It is described as the same as the PFZ 550PE "but without orbital action".
The latter, in the same catalogue is said to "cope effortlessly with straight cuts and offers you optimum curve cutting".
Pictures show the PFZ 550E being used as a "handy all-purpose saw" (cutting plastic piping), as a file and as a brush.
All these show the saw being used in similar orientation to panel saw mode.
Another picture shows the saw being used as a rasp "to give wood the finishing touch".
The last mentioned use, however, is not comparable to a jigsaw.
The device is being moved towards the user.
48 There is no clear direction, or indeed any direction at all, for use of this device as a jigsaw.
2.7.3 Makita JR3000V 
 
49 The tool itself was in evidence and was described in a Makita Catalogue.
It appears with another saw JR3010 under the heading "Recipro Saws".
It is a reciprocating saw.
It is said also to have an "adjustable rocker shoe".
It is not said that it can be used as a jigsaw.
The list of accessories for Recipro Saws sets out blades suitable for various kinds of materials, but none are identified as being designed for jigsaw use.
Immediately adjacent to the Recipro Saws in the catalogue appear conventional jigsaws.
2.7.4 The Complete Book of Tools p 106 
 
50 This text shows a reciprocating saw in panel saw mode.
The blades can be turned to allow cutting in different directions.
This solution of altering the blade position is something different from the Patent where the orientation of the body or handle of the tool is altered relative to the hand of the user.
2.7.5 The Bosten design patent 
 
51 This United States design patent discloses a reciprocating saw but there is no separate fixed handle.
The tool is designed to be held by the body.
There is a slide switch rather than a trigger.
Dr Stark accepted that this patent was not saying that a user could hold the barrel vertically and cut away with their primary hand.
2.7.6 The Kivela patent 
 
52 This United States patent is directed to an attachment for a drill.
There is no reference to a jigsaw blade or to jigsaw cutting.
The attachment allows the user to perform a sawing operation with the teeth facing at any one of four different directions (at 90 degree intervals).
The user is able to cut in the chosen direction without altering or reorienting the body or handle of the tool relative to the user.
2.7.7 The Burrows patent 
 
53 This United States patent is for a "new and improved drive mechanism for a portable reciprocating saw".
The patent discloses a blade with teeth facing downward.
It also discloses that the blade may be turned so that the teeth face upwardly.
However, the tool is designed with a handle and trigger positioned so that the device is intended to be used only in the panel saw orientation shown in Figure 1.
While it would not be impossible to operate the saw upside down, it would be ergonomically inferior and there would be no reason to do so.
Cutting in different directions is accommodated by the fact that the blade may be rotated.
2.8 Obviousness 
 
54 Section 18(1) of the Patents Act relevantly provides that, for the purposes of a standard patent, an invention is a "patentable invention" so far as claimed in any claim if the invention
 (b) when compared with the prior art base as it existed before the priority date of that claim: 
 
 ...
 (ii) involves an inventive step... 
 
 
55 Section 7(2) of the Patents Act defines the concept of inventive step and 7(3) the information which may be added to common general knowledge.
The present case is governed by the provisions which were in force before the operation of the Patents Amendment Act 2001 (Cth).
The relevant provisions were:
 (2) For the purposes of this Act, an invention is to be taken to involve an inventive step when compared with the prior art base unless the invention would have been obvious to a person skilled in the relevant art in the light of the common general knowledge as it existed in the patent area before the priority date of the relevant claim, whether that knowledge is considered separately or together with either of the kinds of information mentioned in subsection (3), each of which must be considered separately.
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the kinds of information are: 
 
 
 (a) prior art information made publicly available in a single document or through doing a single act; and 
 (b) prior art information made publicly available in 2 or more related documents, or through doing 2 or more related acts, if the relationship between the documents or acts is such that a person skilled in the relevant art in the patent area would treat them as a single source of that information; 
 
 
being information that the skilled person mentioned in subsection (2) could, before the priority date of the relevant claim, be reasonably expected to have ascertained, understood and regarded as relevant to work in the relevant art in the patent area.
56 The relevant definition of "prior art base" in the Dictionary in sch 1 was:
 (a) in relation to deciding whether an invention does or does not involve an inventive step or an innovative step: 
 
 (i) information in a document that is publicly available, whether in or out of the patent area; and
 (ii) information made publicly available through doing an act in the patent area.

 
(b) in relation to deciding whether an invention is or is not novel: 
 
 (i) information of a kind mentioned in paragraph (a); and 
 (ii) information contained in a published specification filed in respect of a complete application where: 
 
 
 
 
 (A) if the information is, or were to be, the subject of a claim of the specification, the claim has, or would have, a priority date earlier than that of the claim under consideration; and 
 (B) the specification was published after the priority date of the claim under consideration; and
 (C) the information was contained in the specification on its filing date and when it was published.

 
 
 
57 In Lockwood 2 at [111] the High Court noted, in the context of an invention said to arise from a combination of integers, that whether that combination or addition
 is inventive will turn on what a person skilled in the relevant art, possessed with that person's knowledge, would have regarded, at the time, as technically possible in terms of mechanics, and also as practical.
That is the sense in which an idea can involve an inventive insight about a known product.
A court cannot substitute its own deduction or proposition for that objective touchstone, except in the rarest of circumstances, such as where an expressly admitted matter of common general knowledge is the precise matter in respect of which a monopoly is claimed.
Even if an idea of combining integers, which individually may be considered mere design choices, is simple, its simplicity does not necessarily make it obvious.
Older cases concerning simple mechanical combinations illustrate this point, as does Haberman [v Jackel International Ltd [1999] FSR 683 at 697---8, 706 per Laddie J].
58 As already noted ([20] above), the relevant skilled person is one skilled in the design and manufacture of power tools, as distinct from a dealer or end user.
59 Black  Decker point out, validly in my opinion, that GMCA's experts Dr Stark and Mr Stephen Bloom were not asked to and did not give evidence about the state of common general knowledge in Australia at the priority date.
60 Mr Bloom is the General Manager of a company which supplies hand and power tools to members of the building trades and home handymen.
His evidence was that renovators often use sabre saws (reciprocating power saws) to cut in different directions 
 towards and away from them, particularly for rough cut outs in walls or ceilings, or for cutting out holes in bench tops for sinks, though a jigsaw tool might have been used if it had been available.
These orientations might require the little finger to be used to work the switch mechanism.
He himself had used a reciprocating power saw in this manner before the priority date.
61 Mr Christopher Barrett is a carpenter and registered builder.
His evidence was that he used Milwaukee and Makita reciprocating saws before 1998 
 for window removal and cutting of wall plates, nails in domestic renovations and extensions in various applications, during the course of demolition and construction.
He no longer possesses the saws in question and does not remember model numbers.
His evidence is not sufficiently clear to establish that the saws he refers to were part of common general knowledge.
