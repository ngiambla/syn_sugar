 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 18 July 2007, the respondent ('Peoplebank') caused an order to be entered following an estimate of costs and the issue of a certificate of taxation in accordance with O 62 r 46 of the Federal Court Rules ('the order').
The applicant ('Cytel') seeks to set aside the order on the basis that Cytel did not receive a copy of the estimate of costs.
Background 
 
2 On 3 November 2006, I made certain costs orders with the consent of Cytel and Peoplebank.
Those costs orders provided that Cytel pay Peoplebank's costs in respect of a number of different aspects of the litigation, some on a party/party basis and some on an indemnity basis.
Peoplebank retained a costs consultant to prepare a bill of costs in taxable form, being the costs that Peoplebank claimed to be payable in accordance with the costs orders.
That bill of costs was filed in the Court on 29 March 2007 ('the bill of costs').
The total sum for the costs and disbursements in the bill of costs was $195,350.38.
3 Order 62 rule 46 of the Federal Court Rules relevantly provides:
 (3) (a) A taxing officer may, in the absence of the parties and without making any determination on the individual items in the bill, make an estimate of the approximate total for which, if the bill were to be taxed, the certificate of taxation would be likely to issue.
(b) The Registrar will notify each party interested in the bill in writing of an estimate made under paragraph (a).
(c) A party interested may, within 21 days after the date of issue of a notice under paragraph (b), file and serve on each other party a notice of objection to the estimate.
(ca) If there is no notice of objection, the amount of the estimate is deemed to be the amount for which a certificate of taxation may be issued.
(cb) If a certificate of taxation has been issued for an amount determined under paragraph (ca), a party that has not received a notice under paragraph (b) may apply by motion to the Court for an order to set aside the certificate of taxation.
4 The bill of costs was referred for consideration by a taxing officer of the Court on 24 April 2007.
The registrar assessed the bill of costs in accordance with O 62 r 46(3) of the Federal Court Rules .
The taxing officer, in the absence of the parties and in accordance with subrule (3)(a), made an estimate of the approximate total for which, if the bill were to be taxed, the certificate of taxation would be likely to issue ('the estimate').
The estimate was in the amount of $154,000.
That is, there was an approximate 25% reduction of the total amount claimed in the bill of costs.
The estimate was notified to the parties by letter of 1 May 2007.
5 No complaint is made by Cytel of any step taken by the Court.
That is, Cytel accepts that the letter of 1 May 2007, addressed to the solicitors for both parties, was sent.
That letter to Cytel was addressed to its solicitors, Norman Waterhouse Lawyers ('Norman Waterhouse'), at a document exchange address and endorsed ' Your Ref: T Orlizki '.
Mr Orlizki was the solicitor at Norman Waterhouse handling the matter for Cytel.
6 The 1 May 2007 letter made it clear that the letter constituted notice of the estimate under O 62 r 46(3)(b) and drew attention to the provisions of subrules 46(3)(c),(ca),(cb),(d) and (e).
The letter notified the parties that, if a notice of objection to the estimate was not filed, Peoplebank would be able to prepare and lodge a draft certificate of taxation.
Cytel had 21 days after the issue of the notice in the 1 May 2007 letter to file and serve a notice of objection to the estimate.
It did not do so.
7 Cytel contends that the 1 May 2007 letter was never received.
8 As Cytel did not file and serve a notice of objection to the estimate, the taxing officer issued a certification of taxation on 15 June 2007 in the sum of $154,000 ('the certificate of taxation').
On 20 June 2007, Peoplebank's solicitors sent a copy of the certificate of taxation with a letter to Mr Orlizki at Norman Waterhouse.
The 20 June 2007 letter made it clear that the certificate of taxation was being formally served and made a demand for the sum of $154,000 within 14 days of the date of the letter.
On the same date, Peoplebank's solicitors served Cytel at its business address.
The letter to Cytel also sought payment within 14 days of the sum of $154,000 as set out in the certificate of taxation.
9 Cytel accepts that the letter of 20 June 2007 enclosing the 15 June 2007 certificate of taxation was received.
10 No payment was made by Cytel within the 14 days of service of the certificate of taxation.
Peoplebank's solicitors arranged for the certificate of taxation to be entered as a judgment of the Court and, on 18 July 2007, an order was entered pursuant to O 62 r 45(3) that Cytel pay the sum of $154,000 to Peoplebank.
A copy of that order was served on Norman Waterhouse on 25 July 2007 to the attention of Mr Orlizki.
The letter asked that an arrangement be made for payment of ' the judgment debt immediately '.
11 Cytel has not paid the amount sought or any part thereof.
Cytel seeks to set aside the order.
It also seeks orders that the certificate of taxation be set aside, that the enforcement of the judgment be stayed and that it be granted time to file a notice of objection to the bill of costs.
Cytel also seeks to set aside an order made on 26 July 2007 that the proceedings be stayed until such time as the costs are paid.
12 Cytel says that it is entitled to apply for the orders as ' a party that has not received a notice ', within O 62 r 46(3)(cb).
If Cytel received a copy of the estimate, it cannot apply under subrule (cb) to set aside the certificate of taxation or, it follows, the order based upon it.
13 Cytel does not dispute that receipt by Mr Orlizki would be sufficient for the purposes of subrule (cb).
Cytel does not dispute that it carries the onus of establishing that it did not receive the estimate.
