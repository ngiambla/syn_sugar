A claim of religious persecution 
 
2 The appellant is a national of the People's Republic of China.
He arrived in Australia on 4 August 2006 and lodged an application for a protection visa one week later.
His application was based on a number of claimed reasons to fear persecution by the Chinese authorities, however the only one presently relevant is his Catholic faith.
