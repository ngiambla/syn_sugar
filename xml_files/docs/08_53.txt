 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 These two proceedings were heard concurrently with evidence in one being evidence in the other.
The applicants in NSD 544 of 2003, Bannerhey Pty Ltd ('Bannerhey') and Englert Nominees Pty Ltd ('Englert'), are companies associated with Mr Terence Gretton, at all relevant times, a director of both companies.
The applicants in NSD 545 of 2003, Mr David Horton and Mrs Peggy-Ann Horton (together 'the Hortons'), are husband and wife.
The respondents are common to both proceedings --- 1800 000 000 Pty Ltd ('1800') being a company associated with Messrs Antony and Andrew Jacobson (together "the Jacobsons'), at all relevant times directors of 1800.
I shall henceforth refer to proceeding NSD 544 of 2003 as 'the Bannerhey matter' and to proceeding NSD 545 of 2003 as 'the Horton matter'.
2 The applicants in both proceedings claim damages, declaratory and other relief pursuant to the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') alleging that 1800 engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of Part V of the Act and alleging that the Jacobsons were persons involved in that contravention within the meaning of that phrase in s 75B of the Act.
The conduct allegations in both proceedings are predicated upon certain representations which the respondents are alleged to have made in calling for expressions of interest in and about an exclusive right to use and to license others to use a telephone number, 1800 000 000, and domain names, 1800000000.com and 1800000000.com.au for the States of New South Wales and Queensland in conversations, during meetings and otherwise leading up to the entry by the Hortons into a Master Licence Agreement dated 1 August 2001 ('the Horton Master Licence Agreement') for New South Wales and by Bannerhey into a Master Licence Agreement dated 2 August 2001 ('the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement') for Queensland.
On the fourth day of the hearing, I gave leave to the applicants in both proceedings to file an amended statement of claim.
3 The respondents filed a cross-claim against Bannerhey and Mr and Mrs Gretton (together 'the Grettons') in the Bannerhey matter and a cross-claim against the Hortons in the Horton matter.
At the commencement of the hearing, I gave leave to the respondents to file an amended cross-claim in both proceedings.
The respondents, as cross-claimants, claim damages, an indemnity against any verdict that may be found against them, declaratory and other relief pursuant to the Act (but only in the Bannerhey matter), the Fair Trading Act (Vic) 1999 , the Fair Trading Act (Qld) 1989 (but only in the Bannerhey matter) and the Fair Trading Act (NSW) 1987 (but only in the Horton matter) alleging contraventions of such statutes by Bannerhey and the Grettons in the Bannerhey matter, and by the Hortons in the Horton matter, and claiming a liability on the part of the cross-respondents to indemnify the cross-claimants, against any loss, damage or injury, costs and expenses arising from breaches by Bannerhey and the Grettons in the Bannerhey matter, and by the Hortons in the Horton matter, of any undertaking, agreement or obligation on their part or from any act or omission by Bannerhey or the Hortons, as the case may be, or any agent or employee of the cross-respondents.
Towards the end of day nine of the hearing I asked counsel for the respondents/cross-claimants to identify the evidence that was going to be relied on in relation to the cross-claim but nothing was forthcoming other than what might be gleaned from [128] to [131] of the respondents' submissions.
I deal with those submissions, as well as the applicants' submissions in reply, at [179] below.
4 These proceedings were originally set down for hearing for one week commencing 17 October 2005.
By the end of day three, it was obvious that the hearing was not going to finish within the week and arrangements were initially put in place to sit on Monday and Tuesday of the following week to complete the evidence, with the parties subsequently filing written submissions in accordance with an agreed timetable.
By end of day six it was obvious that the evidence was not going to be completed by the end of day seven and, unsatisfactory as it was, it became necessary to stand the proceedings over for approximately four weeks to 21 November 2005.
That day became three days, 21 --- 23 November 2005 inclusive, with the evidence being completed late on 23 November 2005.
On that last mentioned day, a timetable for filing and serving written submissions was fixed:
 
 (1) The applicants by 9 December 2005
 (2) The respondents by 23 December 2005
 (3) The applicants in reply by 27 January 2006 

with the parties being given, if they so wished, the opportunity to make supplementary oral submissions on a mutually convenient date early in February 2006.
None of the parties was able to comply with this timetable and it was subsequently extended and further extended on at least two occasions to accommodate one or more of the parties.
In the result, the applicants filed and served their written submissions on or about 23 December 2005, the respondents filed and served their written submissions on 6 April 2006 and the applicants filed their written submissions in reply on 20 June 2006.
The parties were then to nominate, within fourteen days, a mutually agreeable date or dates for the hearing of supplementary oral submissions but when they had not done so by early September 2006, I listed the matter for directions on Friday, 15 September 2006.
The proceedings were listed for hearing of supplementary oral submission on 5 October 2006 but then, even this date, had to be abandoned at the request of one of the parties.
The supplementary oral submissions were ultimately heard on 25 October 2006 and the parties, at their request, were again given the opportunity to file any further written submissions within a timetable which again could not be complied with; ultimately the applicants filed their further written submissions on 6 November 2006 and the respondents filed their further written submissions on 14 November 2006.
RELEVANT EVENTS, COMMUNICATIONS AND MEETINGS 
 
5 I have characterised the following events, communications and meetings as relevant by reference to the pleadings in each matter.
Most occur before the conclusion of the relevant Master Licence Agreement, although some occur afterwards and are characterised as relevant by reference to the context they provide.
The Bannerhey Matter 
 
6 On or about 26 May 2001, 1800 placed an advertisement in the Brisbane Courier Mail ('the Queensland advertisement').
The Queensland advertisement was headed:
 ' 1800 000 000 
 QLD MASTER LICENCE OPPORTUNITY ' 
 

And read as follows:
 
 ' 1800 000 000 is much more than Australia's best ever telephone number, it is also Australia's most exciting business marketing and franchise system.
1800 000 000 is taking Australia by storm and revolutionising existing and new business' corporate identities and business systems.

 
 Consistent with its program of national expansion, 1800 000 000 is seeking to appoint an exclusive QLD Master Licensee to work closely with 1800 000 000 Directors and senior management in establishing the Franchise Services division through a network of unit licensees throughout Brisbane and Queensland.

 
 This is a rare opportunity to play a key role in expanding what is destined to become one of Australia's most successful franchise systems.

 
 Initial investment requirements of circa $400,000 are expected to generate unmatched returns and business growth.
' 
 

The Queensland advertisement provided that:
 'For further information, please call 
 Mr Antony Jacobson on 1800 000 000 
 or visit www.1800000000.com.
' 
 

7 A couple of days after reading the advertisement, Mr Gretton phoned Mr Antony Jacobson who referred him to the 1800 website ('the initial Bannerhey contact').
8 A few days later, after the initial Bannerhey contact, Mr Antony Jacobson phoned Mr Gretton ('the second Bannerhey contact').
Mr Gretton's evidence was that he informed Mr Antony Jacobson that he had read the website and that he was interested in what he had seen.
9 On 30 May 2001, Mr Gretton faxed to Mr Antony Jacobson an application form which he had received from Mr Antony Jacobson and completed.
10 Shortly after Mr Gretton returned the completed application form --- seven to ten days after the second Bannerhey contact --- Mr Antony Jacobson and Mr Gretton arranged to meet in Brisbane at the Quay West Hotel.
The meeting took place in early to mid June 2001 ('the first Bannerhey meeting').
11 Shortly after the first Bannerhey meeting, Mr Gretton received some documents from Mr Antony Jacobson including a form of Master Licence Agreement and Illustrative Cash Flow for New South Wales.

Mr Horton conceded that at this meeting Mr Andrew Jacobson offered to return the money Mr Horton had paid in exchange for cancelling the master licence but Mr Horton declined to take up the offer.
In re-examination he said that he declined because he did not take it to be a serious offer.

(b) Denied the representation alleged.
(c) Denied the representation alleged.
(d) Denied the representation alleged.
(e) Admitted that after the Agreement was executed, Mr Andrew Jacobson when asked by Mr Gretton whether he should give notice to Ricoh then, said that it might be a breach of Mr Gretton's duties to his employer if he were to attend Port Douglas or to commence operating the 1800 000 000 Business in Queensland while he was in full time employment and that he may be required under his contract with Ricoh to give four weeks notice and that this may require Port Douglas to be postponed to which Mr Gretton replied that less notice would be sufficient.
Mr Gretton also represented on occasions that he was very unhappy with employment at Ricoh.
Save as aforesaid the respondents did not admit the representation alleged in (e).

 The matters in (a) and (e) were oral.
(6) Denied the June Representations, the 26 June Representations, the June/July Representations and the 2 August Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in the ways respectively referred to in [31] --- [34], inclusive of the amended statement of claim.


57 In response to the applicants pleading at [14] of the amended statement of claim that Bannerhey relied upon the five identified representations in entering into the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement and granting Englert a sub-licence, the respondents admitted that Bannerhey entered into the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement with 1800 on 2 August 2001 and that the Grettons guaranteed the obligations of Bannerhey but otherwise denied the facts alleged in [14] of the amended statement of claim.
58 In response to the applicants' pleading at [26] of the amended statement of claim that at no time did 1800 have or make available to Bannerhey a business system or method which was capable of exploiting the telephone number 1800 000 000 or the domain name associated with it in the manner represented in [7], [9], [10], [12] and [13], the respondents denied these allegations.
59 In response to the applicants' pleading at [35] that each of these representations made in these paragraphs constituted conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, the respondents denied these allegations.

The Horton Matter 
 
61 In their amended statement of claim the applicants identified five representations ([4], [6], [7] [8] and [9]) which they pleaded they relied upon ([10]) in entering into the Horton Master Licence Agreement.
They pleaded ([19]) that at no time did 1800 have or make available to them a business system or method which was capable of exploiting the telephone number 1800 000 000 or the domain names allocated with it in the manner represented in [4], [6], [7], [8] and [9] and that each of the representations made in these paragraphs constituted conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive ([27]).
The Unique Business System Representation: [4] 
 
62 On and after May 2001, 1800 was or claimed to be the owner of a unique business system and methods comprising confidential information, trade secrets, and know how throughout Australia involving an exclusive right to use and to licence others to use a telephone number 1800 000 000 and domain names 1800 000 000.com and 1800 000 000.com.au together with goodwill attaching to those rights (the 'Master Licence Business').

(4) As to the 4 July Representations, admitted that a meeting of the Jacobsons with Mr Horton took place in Melbourne on 4 July 2001, say that the Jacobsons were at all material times acting as directors or agents of 1800, and in relation to the alleged representations: 
 
 
 (a) Denied the representation alleged.

 (6) Denied the 1 June Representations, the 12 June Representations, the 4 July Representations and the 10 July Representations were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in the ways respectively referred to in [23] --- [26], inclusive, of the amended statement of claim.


70 In response to the applicants pleading at [10] of the amended statement of claim that the applicants relied upon the five identified representations in entering into the Horton Master Licence Agreement, the respondents admitted that the applicants entered into the Horton Master Licence Agreement with 1800 on 1 August 2001 but otherwise denied the facts alleged in [10] of the amended statement of claim.
71 In response to the applicants' pleading at [19] of the amended statement of claim that at no time did 1800 have or make available to the applicants a business system or method which was capable of exploiting the telephone number 1800 000 000 or the domain name associated with it in the manner represented in [4], [6], [7], [8] and [9], the respondents denied these allegations.
72 In response to the applicants' pleading at [27] that each of these representations made in these paragraphs constituted conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, the respondents denied these allegations.
73 In response to the applicants' pleading at [28] that the representations in [4], [6(d)], [7(b) and (c)], [8(d), (f) and (g)] and [9(d)] were representations as to a future matter and 1800 did not have reasonable grounds for making such representations, the respondents denied these allegations.
74 Nearly all of the pleaded representations alleged to have been made by the respondents in both proceedings were said to have been made orally over a period approaching three months.
There were a few exceptions.
In both proceedings, the 'Unique Business System Representation' was said to have been made in physical form --- on 1800's website and in Recital A of the respective Master Licence Agreements --- as well as orally during the meetings and conversations identified in the respective amended statements of claim; and the representation that 'the Master Licensee would have very high returns from large corporations with little risk as a result of the value of the 1800 000 000 number' was in both proceedings, alleged to have been made in a document entitled 'Illustrative Cash Flow Model (Qld)' provided to the Grettons (as well as having been made orally at the Bannerhey Melbourne meeting) in the case of the Bannerhey matter and in a document entitled 'Illustrative Cash Flow Model (NSW)' provided to the Hortons (as well as having been made orally at the first Horton Melbourne meeting) in the case of the Horton matter.
75 In both proceedings, the Unique Business System Representation was effectively admitted but in the case of all other alleged representations, the vast majority were totally denied.
There is thus a preliminary issue as to whether the representations were made and because they are, in nearly every case, said to have been made orally, this inevitably raises issues of credit.
THE EVIDENCE 
 
76 At the commencement of the hearing I directed that all evidence in chief of what was said by the Grettons on the one hand and the Jacobsons on the other up to and including the Bannerhey completion meeting on 2 August 2001 and all evidence of what was said by the Hortons on the one hand and the Jacobsons on the other up to and including the Horton completion meeting on 1 August 2001 should be adduced orally.
Counsel for Bannerhey indicated some surprise at this, however, I had, at an earlier directions hearing, indicated that was what I proposed to do.
77 Moreover, in the interests of efficiency in cross-examination of witnesses called on behalf of the applicants, all parties agreed that in the Bannerhey matter, as between the Grettons, Mr Gretton was the principal negotiator/decision-maker and that in the Horton matter, as between the Hortons, Mr Horton was the principal negotiator/decision-maker.
On behalf of Bannerhey 
 
78 The principal witness called on behalf of Bannerhey was Mr Gretton.
Mr Gretton swore four affidavits:
 
 (1) Affidavit sworn 9 June 2004 --- Ex.
1
 (2) Affidavit sworn 11 March 2005 --- Ex.
3
 (3) Affidavit sworn 7 June 2005 --- Ex.
4
 (4) Affidavit sworn 19 October 2005 --- Ex.
9 

79 I was not impressed with Mr Gretton as a witness.
In his evidence in chief, his recall of what he said to the Jacobsons and what each of them said to him at the meetings and telephone conversations they had prior to the signing of the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement was extremely poor; indeed, in some cases, it was non-existent.
He even had difficulty in recalling the subjects discussed during some of the meetings.
Moreover, as indicated at [84] below, there is one aspect of his evidence in chief I cannot accept.
80 His evidence in cross-examination was not much better although he was able to deny or confirm that certain things were said to him or by him during the course of these meetings and telephone conversations.
On the other hand, I formed the impression that some of his responses were evasive in the sense of concealing more than they disclosed.
This was particularly so when he was cross-examined on subjects where an unqualified or forthright response may not have been in his interests.
81 The alleged lack or absence of a business system or model which Bannerhey could work with in promoting sales of sub-licences seemed to permeate the totality of Mr Gretton's evidence and was at the forefront of his complaint that Bannerhey had been misled in representations made by the Jacobsons on behalf of 1800.
I found this whole concept of a business system or model to be elusive.
It was never explored with Mr Gretton in chief with the consequence that it was not possible to draw any conclusion as to, or articulate, what exactly it was that was represented to be forthcoming but was not.
At one level it was nothing more than the ideas and concepts that the Jacobsons had in mind as to how the telephone number 1800 000 000 might best be promoted and marketed to maximise returns.
At this first level, the system or model not only existed, but its structure and content were largely conveyed to Bannerhey via Mr Gretton prior to the signing of the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement.
At another level, it was the manifestation of those ideas and concepts in a material form which could be utilised as promotional and marketing tools --- to assist State licensees, such as Bannerhey, in their selling enterprises.
At this second level, they did not exist at the time of the signing of the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement although they did by early 2002.
The elusive nature or character of the system or model stemmed from the impression drawn from Mr Gretton's evidence that a system was represented to exist, but was not forthcoming, at a higher level, although this higher level was never articulated.
I deal with these different levels below.
82 At the first Bannerhey meeting, Mr Gretton's evidence was that in response to his question to have the system explained to him, Mr Antony Jacobson said that the intention was to divide Queensland into a number of different areas, within the Brisbane metropolitan area on the one hand and the rest of Queensland on the other, with sub-licences being sold to both big and small businesses in each area.
This was the system, or part of it, at the first level.
83 At the Bannerhey Melbourne meeting, Mr Gretton's evidence was that he could only recall one subject being raised by him on the morning of the first day, namely, his requests for an explanation of the system all of which he said were met with the response that all would be revealed once the agreements have been signed.
This was despite the fact that the meeting on the morning of the first day was over a period of three hours.
He could recall that, in response to a question his wife raised over lunch, it was explained that the software for the system was not finished; but he could not recall anything that was discussed after lunch.
While he met again with Mr Antony Jacobson on the second day after visiting a call centre at North Carlton, the only subject he could recall discussing with Mr Antony Jacobson was the cost of calls coming in from around Australia.
84 Mr Gretton could recall a number of the subjects that were discussed during several telephone conversations that took place as part of the Bannerhey July communications but had little or no recall of the actual conversations.
The subjects included the system, the Port Douglas training conference, the illustrative cash flow for Queensland and the premises in Brisbane.
In relation to the illustrative cash flow for Queensland, I asked Mr Gretton whether he had asked Mr Antony Jacobson any questions.
His evidence was that he had asked whether the figures in the cash flow were realistic and that Mr Antony Jacobson had told him that they were.
He further said that he believed him.
When I asked him whether his belief was based on the face value of the cash flow document, he answered in the affirmative.
In the light of Mr Gretton's evidence in cross-examination, I cannot accept his evidence on this point.
85 Mr Gretton could not recall much of what occurred at the Bannerhey completion meeting other than that he again raised the question of whether the system was ready to go, to which he said Mr Andrew Jacobson answered in the affirmative and that the Jacobsons insisted that he should leave Ricoh immediately as the system was virtually ready to roll out.
In context, I take this to mean the system at the second level.
86 Mr Gretton was cross-examined at some length as to his knowledge of the existence of 1800's business, if any, both prior to and at the time Bannerhey entered into the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement.
He confirmed that he knew that the business of 1800 he was considering purchasing was untried and untested in the marketplace; and that 1800 had not sold the concept at all in Australia or indeed anywhere else in the world.
He qualified in a variety of ways his responses to questions seeking admissions that he knew that the 1800 business was not yet up and running, that it was a start-up business, that Bannerhey was getting involved in a speculative business venture and at the entry level of establishing a new business, but the thrust of his evidence despite the qualifications was that he knew these things prior to Bannerhey entering into the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement.
This was confirmed when in response to a question I put to him he said that he understood that there was no business, as opposed to Bannerhey buying a business as a going concern:
 
 'I thought I was buying a system ... that was already in place.
Lots of contacts to be contacted.
Lots of people to sell to, and all I had to do was provide my sales expertise because everything was ready and running to go.
' 
 

Perhaps this was the articulation of the system at its next level.
87 Returning to the first level, Mr Gretton conceded in cross-examination that at the Bannerhey Melbourne meeting he was told a number of things about the system and how it would operate.
Again he sought to qualify his answers by saying the theory was right, but that he never saw the practice.
When pressed, he conceded that the various subjects were discussed with him by the Jacobsons.
88 Mr Gretton conceded in cross-examination that he would have read the disclaimer on the fifth page of the Illustrative Cash Flow Model for Queensland after the figures on the first four pages for years 1 --- 4 inclusive and that he understood the meaning of the words in the disclaimer:
 
 'This Cash Flow model is for illustrative and analytical purposes only.
1800 000 000 Pty Ltd does not warrant, represent or predict that any assumption predicating this model or that any circumstance, performance, or event depicted in this model is correct, substantially accurate or will eventuate.
This model is not based on historical performance of a similar business and the actual performance of the Licensed Operation is dependent on many factors which 1800 000 000 Pty Ltd is unable to predict.

 1800 000 000 Pty Ltd shall not be liable for any error or omission in this Cash Flow model.
' 
 

89 Mr Gretton was asked a number of questions concerning the assumptions, 1 to 18, appearing underneath the disclaimer, and his responses to the pertinent questions were evasive in the sense to which I have referred.
His responses to questions going to the warranties and other provisions in cl 7 of the Queensland Master Licence Agreement were more forthright.
Ultimately he conceded that he fully appreciated that at no stage leading up to the execution of the Queensland Master Licence Agreement was 1800 vouching for the accuracy of the information contained either in the cash flow document or in any oral statements made to him.
90 Mr Gretton conceded in cross-examination that by November/December 2001 a lot of work had been done by the Jacobsons to ensure that the 1800 000 000 concept would be as successful as possible, but claimed that this was work that should have been done before 1 August, 2001.
In particular, he referred to brochures, both large and small, letterheads and business cards.
His evidence was that once these things were finalised, he would be content to go out into the marketplace and sell the product which, in his own words, was 'the phone number'.
This is what I have called the delivery of the system at its second level.
91 When I questioned Mr Gretton on what the phrase 'this extraordinary business system' in the larger of the brochures referred to, or whether it was just access to a telephone number, he responded: 'the things that need to go on behind the scenes; like once that phone number is called, where it ends up; who answers it'.
That's what he understood it (the system) to be.
This was repeated a little later in cross-examination.
This is what I called the system at its first level.
92 Mr Gretton's evidence was that he sent the brochures out to potential customers and, to his knowledge, so did Mr Horton.
When I asked him, he conceded that the sentence: '1800 000 000 is rapidly becoming one of Australia's most frequently called numbers and the first choice alternative to paper telephone directories' in the smaller of the brochures, was not factually true.
93 Mr Gretton's evidence was that by 30 January 2002 he was ready to hit the market; he finally had something to go to the marketplace with.
In recognition of the length of time involved in preparing the marketing materials (the delivery of the system at its second level), the Expiry Date under the Queensland Master Licence Agreement was extended to a date being five years from 1 February 2002.
But by the end of April 2002 Mr Gretton realised the Queensland market was 'as dead as a doornail'.
Nothing was happening and despite suggestions to Mr Antony Jacobson as to other ways to make money, nothing did happen.
94 The other witness called on behalf of Bannerhey was Mrs Gretton.
Mrs Gretton swore an affidavit on 9 June 2004 --- Ex 2.
95 In chief she said that she accompanied Mr Gretton on his visit to Melbourne in late June 2001.
She recalled that at the Bannerhey Melbourne meeting, Mr Antony Jacobson had said that the Brisbane metropolitan area was to be divided up into 10 areas.
Apart from some discussion about computers, computer programming including call centres and connecting people up, Mrs Gretton could not recall any other subject being discussed or the conversations that occurred during the morning of the first day (2-3 hours), at lunch (although she recalled that Mr Antony Jacobson had said he and Andrew had a lot of information to help them sell to the franchisees) or during the course of that afternoon.
However, she had a clear recollection about a question she put to Mr Antony Jacobson concerning 'the system'.
In response to a question as to what was said, she said:
 
 'I asked, have you got any more information for me and he said that there was a system but he couldn't reveal the system until after Terry and I had signed a master licence.
' 
 

96 Mrs Gretton could recall visiting the call centre at Carlton with her husband and the Jacobsons on the second day but her recall of subjects discussed and details of conversations at the call centre, afterwards at 1800's office, at lunch and in the afternoon was almost non-existent.
97 Mrs Gretton repeated Mr Gretton's evidence as to what was said at the Bannerhey completion meeting, in particular that Mr Antony Jacobson had said:
 
 '... within two to three weeks of signing up this business system would be ready to go and that Terry and I needed to be available at that time to start.
' 
 

98 In cross-examination, Mrs Gretton's recall of subjects discussed and details of conversations was, apart from certain family matters, just as poor.
99 It was suggested to Mrs Gretton that her ability to recall what Mr Antony Jacobson said about the system at the Bannerhey Melbourne meeting --- that it wouldn't be revealed until the Master Licence Agreement was signed when all would be revealed --- when her recollection of other matters discussed was almost non-existent, was because of conversations she had had with her husband about this matter leading up to the hearing, however, she rejected this suggestion.
I have to say that I have some difficulty in accepting her evidence on this matter in the face of her inability to recall much of anything else.
On behalf of the Hortons 
 
100 The principal witness called on behalf of the Hortons was Mr Horton.
Mr Horton swore four affidavits:
 
 
 (1) Affidavit sworn 9 June 2004 --- Ex 5.
(2) Affidavit sworn 20 May 2005 --- Ex 6.
(3) Affidavit sworn 18 October 2005 --- Ex 11.
(4) Affidavit sworn 7 April 2005 --- Ex 12.

 

Mr Horton was a more impressive witness than Mr Gretton although I got the impression that he had prepared for his testimony by recent reference to the pleadings in the amended statement of claim.
He certainly had little independent recollection of what was otherwise said and by whom at the various meetings during which the representations pleaded were alleged to have been made.
This is, perhaps, best exemplified by his evidence in relation to the third Horton Melbourne meeting.
101 In chief, at the first Horton meeting, Mr Horton could recall the questions he raised with Mr Antony Jacobson and Mr Jacobson's responses to those questions.
Most of Mr Horton's questions went to the operation of the 1800 000 000 system --- how it was structured and how it would operate.
He also gave clear and precise evidence of the matters which were the subject of the notes he made at that meeting.
102 Mr Horton's evidence of what was said at the first Horton Melbourne meeting was that the subject of his discussions with the Jacobsons principally concerned operational matters, but that other matters were discussed including competition, anticipated revenue streams and possible changes to the terms of a draft of the Horton Master Licence Agreement.
He also asked for information on the marketing plans that the 1800 business system had in place to which he was told that they (the Jacobsons) would think about it.
Shortly afterwards, he received a letter which included a paragraph in the following terms:
 
 'On reflection, please be advised that due to the confidential nature surrounding both our marketing initiatives and the budgetary allocation relating to same, we feel it appropriate to release this sensitive information only to appointed 1800 000 000 master licensees.
On formalising our proposed relationship we would of course be pleased to make full details of our marketing program, budget and schedule available to you.
' 
 

103 Mr Horton's evidence of what relevantly occurred at the second Horton Melbourne meeting is detailed at [160] below.
104 Mr Horton's recollection of what occurred at the third Horton Melbourne meeting was far less clear.
Indeed, apart from recalling what was said when he first arrived concerning the representations pleaded, Mr Horton could not recall anything that was said prior to lunch, during lunch or after lunch.
105 From Mr Horton's evidence, it seems that little was discussed by him with the Jacobsons at the Horton completion meeting apart from their stressing the importance of his wife attending the training conference later that month.
In Mr Horton's words, apart from signing the relevant agreements and handing over a cheque for $440,000, it was a very short meeting.
106 In cross-examination Mr Horton conceded that he believed from the start that the simplicity of the telephone number had market appeal and could make money.
He conceded that as at 1 August 2001 he knew that the Jacobsons were not actively operating the 1800 franchise services division or making money; that the 1800 service was not being offered to anyone in Australia in any way, shape or form as a business.
He conceded that he knew that anything contained in the illustrative cash flow model that he had received was without any warranty as to its accuracy by 1800.
His evidence was that he sought and obtained a six month extension of the term of the Horton Master Licence Agreement because of the delay in delivering some sales brochures to enable him to take the concept to the market.
107 Mr Horton conceded that no matter how much documentation with statistics, models, plans, research and modelling he received from 1800, none of them would establish conclusively whether the concept would make money in New South Wales; the proof of whether or not the concept would succeed or not was ultimately and could only be determined when the product or concept went to the market.
108 Mr Horton's evidence was that at the third Horton Melbourne meeting Mr Antony Jacobson said to him that the 1800 model was proven.
However he conceded that this was contrary to his own knowledge that it was not proven.
In questions I subsequently put to him he said that he did not think he had made that concession, but he clearly did.
109 Mr Horton's evidence was that under the contract, he didn't get what he contracted for.
In responses to some questions I put to him he said:
 
 'My understanding of the contract that I made with the Jacobsons included the master licence and what would be delivered to me under the method that they would be delivering as a business opportunity and a plan that was well developed.
That's what I thought I was getting .... 
 
 I thought I was getting access to their know-how in the communications industry, the software that they developed for the interfaces of the call centres, their understanding of the way that the telephony worked in the modern world, the development of the processes and procedures that needed to be implemented as part of that to actually bring it to a real opportunity, a real business in the marketplace.
' 
 

110 When I put to Mr Horton that what he was complaining he contracted for but did not get really fell under the umbrella of know-how he agreed, but it was never articulated with any greater precision.
It was left hanging similar to Mr Gretton's system at the higher level which he said was represented to exist, but was not forthcoming: see [81] and [86] above.
111 I put a further series of questions to Mr Horton going to why he would sign an agreement that says that there's a business when there was no business.
He said that he saw himself starting a business in New South Wales and that he treated the statements in the documents that there was a business as referring to the 'business model developed by the Jacobsons'.
Mr Horton's admission that he was starting a business in New South Wales does not sit easily with his claim that the Jacobsons represented to him that they had developed a proven business model.
112 Mr Horton's evidence was that as at December of 2001 he believed that there was, what is described in the larger of the sale brochures that had by that time been produced, an 'extraordinary business system' but by January 2002 he did not hold this belief because 'the complete business system I expected to get to run the New South Wales system had not been delivered to me'; 'I did not receive a unique business marketing system to develop the 1800 business in New South Wales including detailed marketing and sales plans and directions and a systemised approach which is what you get from a licensor or franchisor'.
He went on to say that by about April 2002 he was of the view that he 'had been deceived by the Jacobsons' although nothing changed between January and April 2002.
113 In cross-examination, it was put to Mr Horton that during the initial Horton contact, the first Horton meeting, the first Horton Melbourne meeting, the second Horton Melbourne meeting and the third Horton Melbourne meeting and at other times statements were made by him and by the Jacobsons.
He denied most of them, said he could not recall whether some of them had been made and conceded a few had been made, if not in the form put, in a similar form.
114 The other witness called on behalf of the Hortons was Mrs Horton.
Mrs Horton swore an affidavit on 9 June 2004- Ex 7.
115 Mrs Horton accompanied her husband to Melbourne on 10 July 2001 and attended the third Horton Melbourne meeting, but only in the morning.
Her evidence was that Mr Antony Jacobson, in response to a statement from Mr Horton that $400,000 is a lot of money to pay for a business, had said: 'We have a proven business system and model'.
Her evidence was that when she asked for proof of this 'proven system and model', he said: 'That is confidential information, and will not be disclosed until after a contract was signed'.
116 When Mrs Horton was asked in cross-examination what precisely she understood was being said to her that had been proven she said: 
 
 'I believe they had a system and they had a model; and that had been tested, that they had done tests, and they had the documentation to prove that and that that would not be revealed to us until after a contract was signed and a training, and that's what I believed.
I believed there was a system in place for us to use and to work with after we'd signed the contract.
' 
 

117 Mrs Horton agreed that Mr Antony Jacobson had said to her: 'If the business is successful then the licence will be worth a lot more than $400,000'.
On behalf of 1800 
 
118 Two witnesses were called on behalf of 1800, the Jacobsons.
