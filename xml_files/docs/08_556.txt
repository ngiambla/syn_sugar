 
1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court ( SZHZZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1052) dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the second respondent, the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal), not to grant the appellant a protection visa pursuant to s 36(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).
2 The appellant, a citizen of the Philippines, arrived in Australia on 21 April 2005 and lodged an application for a protection visa on 18 May 2005 of that year.
He claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution in the Philippines by reason of his being a homosexual Muslim male in the Philippines.
His application was refused by the Minister on 16 August 2005.
The Tribunal affirmed that decision on 6 December 2005.
3 The appellant outlined the basis for his claim to protection in writing on three occasions prior to the hearing before the Tribunal.
His fundamental claim was that as a male Muslim homosexual he would be in an impossible position if he returned to the Philippines.
His case was summed up in these words: 
 Muslim and gay.
Two words that can not or must not or shall not or will not go together.
Gay is a taboo in muslim society.
4 He claimed to maintain his Muslim faith.
He came from a large and powerful Muslim family from Mindanao and was a member of a particular tribe that adhered to the Muslim faith.
His family was active in politics and he described his father as having been a warlord.
He was the only homosexual in his family and was ostracised by his siblings for this reason.
The situation was aggravated by the existence of Muslim radicals and terrorists, in particular the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
He claimed to suffer emotional and mental anguish.
He claimed that his family would not protect him from harm and that:
 the law of my country do not shield me in such familial and religious pressure.
He referred to threats he had received after he refused to join the MILF.
He feared connivance between his family and the MILF.
He referred to an occasion in 2005 when three Muslim men with faces covered by handkerchiefs cut his long hair with scissors and threatened that next time they would cut his belly.
5 His evidence to the Tribunal fleshed out his position.
He said that in the 2005 incident the men said that if he kept on "doing this" they would cut his belly --- he took them to mean being a homosexual.
He did not report the incident to the police because they would "laugh, because I'm gay".
The Tribunal recorded the following:
 He also stated that, as well as the local Muslim language, he spoke the non-Muslim languages of Tagalog and Bisayan, so people could not tell he was Muslim.
His homosexual friends were all Christians.
He did not reveal to people that he was from the [named] family or was Muslim, so that they would not tell his family anything about him.
6 He had lived for about a year in Manila around 2000.
