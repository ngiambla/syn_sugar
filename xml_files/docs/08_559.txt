 SECTION A --- INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 General
 These four proceedings, which were heard together, relate to Australian patent No 623144 (the Patent or the Australian Escitalopram Patent) held by H Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck), a Danish pharmaceutical company.
Lundbeck applied for the Patent on 13 June 1989.
The application was a Convention application and was said in the application to be based on application No 8814057 for a patent made in the United Kingdom on 14 June 1988 (the UK Escitalopram Patent --- see [79] below).
The title of the invention in the Patent is: "(+)-Enantiomer of citalopram and process for the preparation thereof".
Citalopram is a molecule patented by Lundbeck which is used for the treatment of depression.
Citalopram is a chiral molecule, a racemic mixture (or racemate) comprising in equal measure two enantiomers.
Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.
They are designated "(+)" or "(---)" based on a particular physical property referred to below, and "R" or "S" based on their three-dimensional structure.
The correlation between the (+) or (---) and the R or S designations can only be determined, however, through experimentation.
In the case of citalopram, experimentation subsequent to the priority date has shown that the (+)-enantiomer is in fact the S-enantiomer.
It is commonly referred to as "S-citalopram", and has the International Nonproprietary Name "escitalopram".
The Patent discloses processes for obtaining escitalopram, and data showing that (+)-citalopram is therapeutically more active than citalopram itself, and more than 100 fold more active than (-)-citalopram.
The 20 year term of the Patent was due to expire on 13 June 2009.
The term has, however, been extended as discussed at [28] ff below.
Citalopram is an invention claimed in Australian patent No 509,445 (the Australian Citalopram Patent) dated 5 January 1977, the term of which was sixteen years commencing on that date.
The Australian Citalopram Patent was, in turn, said in the application to be based on the application No 1486/76 for a patent filed in Great Britain on 14 January 1976 (the UK Citalopram Patent).
The title of the invention in the Australian Citalopram Patent is "phthalanes", a class of compounds that includes citalopram.
In various ways, the proceedings before the Court raise issues concerning the relationship between citalopram and escitalopram.
Broadly, the issues can be separated into those that relate to patentability (raised in the proceedings brought by Alphapharm Pty Ltd (Alphapharm) and Arrow Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (Arrow) for revocation of the Patent), infringement (a cross-claim in Alphapharm's revocation proceeding) and regulatory aspects (all four proceedings).
Proceeding NSD 1120 of 2005 (the Revocation Proceeding)
 Alphapharm's claim for revocation
 The Patent comprises six claims.
In proceeding NSD 1120 of 2005 ("the Revocation Proceeding"), Alphapharm seeks a declaration that all six claims are invalid, and an order pursuant to s 138(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (the Act) revoking them all, or, in the alternative, an order pursuant to s 192 of the Act that the Register be rectified to remove an extension of the term of the Patent from the Register of Patents (the Register).
The six claims are as follows: 
 
 1.
(+)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile and non-toxic acid addition salts thereof.

 

 
 
 2.
The pamoic acid salt of (+)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile.

 

 
 
 3.
A pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form comprising as an active ingredient, a compound as defined in claim 1, together with a pharmaceutically accepta[ble] carrier or excipient.

 

 
 
 4.
A pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form comprising, as an active ingredient, the compound of claim 2, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

 

 
 
 5.
A pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form, according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the active ingredient is present in an amount from 0.1 to 100 milligram per unit dose, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

 

 
 
 6.
A method for the preparation of the compound of claim 1, which comprises:
 (a) reacting a compound of the formula 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 with an enantiomerically pure acid derivative as an acid chloride, anhydride or labile ester, subsequently separating the resolved intermediate enantiomer for (+)-citalopram having the formula
 
 wherein R is a labile ester group; by HPLC or fractional crystallization, and then treating said intermediate enantiomer with strong base: or
 (b) reacting a compound of formula II with the enantiomer of an optically active acid affording the pure enantiomer salt of the compound of formula II for (+)-citalopram, and subsequently performing ringclosure via a labile ester by reacting the pure enantiomer of formula II as a base with an activated acid with simultaneous addition of a base and, if desired, transferring the (+)-citalopram obtained to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

 

 
Claims 1---5 are product claims.
Claim 6 is a method claim.
According to Alphapharm's further amended particulars of invalidity filed in Court on the hearing: At the hearing, senior counsel for Alphapharm indicated that Alphapharm was content to proceed on the basis of a priority date of 14 June 1988.
I proceed on the basis of that priority date of 14 June 1988.
I will discuss the case that Alphapharm seeks to make in respect of these grounds of invalidity in due course.
Alphapharm's alternative claim for rectification of the Register
 Alphapharm's alternative claim for rectification of the Register concerns the interaction between the Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth) (the TG Act).
Under the TG Act, a pharmaceutical substance may not be marketed in Australia unless it is, or is contained within, a therapeutic good that is registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).
Alphapharm's application for rectification of the Register raises the same issues as are raised in the Lundbeck Appeal (Extension of Term) Proceeding (discussed at [45] ff below).
An appropriate starting point for an understanding of Alphapharm's alternative claim for rectification of the Register is the Act's provisions relating to the extension of the terms of patents in Pt 3 of Ch 6 of the Act.
Section 67 of the Act provides that the term of a standard patent is 20 years from the date of the patent.
Section 65 provides, relevantly, that the date of a patent is the date of filing of the complete specification, being 13 June 1989 in the present case.
Part 3 (ss 70---79A) of the Act is headed "EXTENSION OF TERM OF STANDARD PATENTS RELATING TO PHARMACEUTICAL SUBSTANCES".
Section 70 of the Act provides, relevantly, as follows: 
 
 (1) The patentee of a standard patent may apply to the Commissioner for an extension of the term of the patent if the requirements set out in subsections (2), (3) and (4) are satisfied.
(2) Either or both of the following conditions must be satisfied:
 (a) one or more pharmaceutical substances per se must in substance be disclosed in the complete specification of the patent and in substance fall within the scope of the claim or claims of that specification;
 (b) ...
 (3) Both of the following conditions must be satisfied in relation to at least one of those pharmaceutical substances:
 (a) goods containing, or consisting of, the substance must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods;
 (b) the period beginning on the date of the patent and ending on the first regulatory approval date for the substance must be at least 5 years.
(4) ...
 (5) For the purposes of this section, the first regulatory approval date, in relation to a pharmaceutical substance, is:
 (a) if no pre-TGA marketing approval was given in relation to the substance [none was given in the present case] --- the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods of goods that contain, or consist of, the substance; or
 (b) ...
 (6) ... 
 

 Section 71(2) of the Act provides a time limit for applications for an extension of the term of a standard patent.
It provides: 
 
 An application for an extension of the term of a standard patent must be made during the term of the patent and within 6 months after the latest of the following dates:
 (a) the date the patent was granted;
 (b) the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods of goods that contain, or consist of, any of the pharmaceutical substances referred to in subsection 70(3);
 (c) the date of commencement of this section.

 

 Sections 74---76 of the Act provide: 
 
 74(1) If a patentee of a standard patent makes an application for an extension of the term of the patent, the Commissioner must accept the application if the Commissioner is satisfied that the requirements of sections 70 and 71 are satisfied in relation to the application.
(2) If the Commissioner accepts the application, the Commissioner must:
 (a) notify the applicant in writing of the acceptance; and
 (b) publish a notice of the acceptance in the Official Journal .
(3) The Commissioner must refuse to accept the application if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the requirements of sections 70 and 71 are satisfied in relation to the application.
(4) If the Commissioner refuses to accept the application, the Commissioner must:
 (a) notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the refusal; and
 (b) publish a notice of the refusal in the Official Journal .

 

 
 
 75(1) The Minister or any other person may, in accordance with the regulations, oppose the grant of an extension of the term of a standard patent on the ground that one or more of the requirements of sections 70 and 71 are not satisfied in relation to the application for the extension.
The Minister or other person may not oppose the grant of the extension on any other ground.
(2) If the grant of an extension of the term of a standard patent is opposed, the Commissioner must decide the case in accordance with the regulations.
(3) The Commissioner must give the applicant and the opponent a reasonable opportunity to be heard before deciding a case.
(4) The applicant, and any opponent, may appeal to the Federal Court against a decision of the Commissioner under this section.

 

 
 
 76(1) The Commissioner must grant an extension of the term of a standard patent if:
 (a) there is no opposition to the grant; or
 (b) in spite of opposition, the Commissioner's decision, or the decision on appeal, is that the extension should be granted.
(2) If the Commissioner grants an extension, the Commissioner must notify the applicant in writing of the grant and publish a notice of the grant in the Official Journal .

 
 Finally, s 77 provides for the calculation of the term of an extension as follows: 
 
 (1) If the Commissioner grants an extension of the term of a standard patent, the term of the extension is equal to:
 (a) the period beginning on the date of the patent and ending on the earliest first regulatory approval date (as defined by section 70) in relation to any of the pharmaceutical substances referred to in subsection 70(2);
 reduced (but not below zero) by:
 (b) 5 years.
(2) However, the term of the extension cannot be longer than 5 years.

 

 Underlying these provisions are certain assumptions.
One is that it may be unreasonable to expect a patentee to derive a sufficient return from a pharmaceutical patent within 20 years because of the necessity, under the TG Act, of first having the relevant goods listed on the ARTG, and of the time that it may take to obtain that listing.
Another assumption, however, is that the patentee should not be permitted to "sit on its hands" once the patent has been issued and once the relevant goods have been listed on the ARTG.
Two timing aspects of the provisions are noteworthy.
Section 71(2) relevantly requires an application for an extension to be made within six months after the date of the "first inclusion" in the ARTG of "goods that contain, or consist of, any of the pharmaceutical substances referred to in subsection 70(3)".
This provision reflects a view that, ordinarily, ARTG registration should mark the beginning of exploitation.
If there is some difficulty in the patentee's exploiting its patent promptly following ARTG registration, it is expected to bring this to light and to apply for an extension without delay.
The second timing aspect is found in ss 70(3)(b) and 77.
These provisions reflect a policy that extensions are intended for circumstances in which the patentee has not been in a position to exploit the invention adequately.
Thus, if the period beginning on the date of the patent and ending on the first regulatory approval date does not exceed five years, the period of the extension is zero, because, after all, the patentee will still have had the benefit of at least 15 years' exploitation of the patent.
On the other hand, if the first regulatory approval date occurs say 15 years into the term of the patent, the period remaining available for exploitation of the patent is only some five years, and the period of the extension for which s 77 provides would be some ten years if s 77(1) stood alone.
However, subs (2) reduces this period to five years because it provides for a maximum extension of five years in all cases.
Since 3 January 1998, Lundbeck Australia Pty Ltd (Lundbeck Australia), a subsidiary of Lundbeck, has marketed an anti-depressant medicine in Australia under the trade mark "CIPRAMIL" (Cipramil).
Cipramil was included in the ARTG on 9 December 1997, as citalopram hydrobromide, an acid addition salt of citalopram.
Since 1 October 2003, Lundbeck Australia has marketed an anti-depressant medicine in Australia under the trade mark "LEXAPRO" (Lexapro).
Lexapro was included in the ARTG on 16 September 2003 as escitalopram oxalate.
It will be recalled that the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram, which experimentation shows is S-citalopram or escitalopram, is the subject of the Patent.
I turn now to the extension of the term of the Patent.
Lundbeck applied for the extension on 22 December 2003.
The Commissioner of Patents (Commissioner) granted the extension on 27 May 2004.
The extension granted was from and including 14 June 2009 to 13 June 2014.
Particulars of the extension granted were entered on the Register.
The date of Lundbeck's filing of its application for the extension, 22 December 2003, was well within six months of the inclusion of Lexapro in the ARTG on 16 September 2003.
However, Alphapharm's contention is that the relevant first inclusion in the ARTG was the inclusion of Cipramil in the ARTG on 9 December 1997.
If Alphapharm is correct, Lundbeck had only until 9 June 1998 to apply for an extension and the application it made on 22 December 2003 was well out of time, and it was not open to the Commissioner to grant an extension.
(I note that Alphapharm's amended statement of claim uses the date 20 November 1997.
However, the trial seemed to have proceeded on the basis that the 9 December 1997 date is correct.
) The question raised is whether, for the purpose of the statutory provisions mentioned, the pharmaceutical substance, the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram, was "contained in" the pharmaceutical good, Cipramil.
This question is related to other issues in the case, such as the issue of novelty (was the (+)-enantiomer the subject of the Patent not novel by reason of the earlier Australian Citalopram Patent?
) and the issues in the TGA (Protected Information) Proceeding discussed at [36] ff below.
Alphapharm pleads in para 7 of its amended statement of claim that Cipramil "contains" a substance which is a mixture of the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram and the (---)-enantiomer of citalopram.
In its further amended defence, Lundbeck replies that S-citalopram and R-citalopram are the appropriate descriptors of (+)-citalopram and (-)-citalopram when in a racemic mixture, but otherwise it denies the allegations in the paragraph.
Thus, Lundbeck denies that Cipramil "contains" (+)-citalopram.
The period from the date of the Patent (13 June 1989) to 9 December 1997, when Cipramil was included in the ARTG, is 8 years, 5 months and 26 days.
The period from the date of the Patent (13 June 1989) to 16 September 2003, when Lexapro was included in the ARTG, is 14 years, 3 months and 3 days.
Accordingly, whichever of the competing contentions as to the "first regulatory approval date" is correct, Lundbeck's application for the extension of term satisfied s 70(3)(b) of the Act, because each of the periods was a period of "at least five years".
If the correct first regulatory approval date is 9 December 1997, s 77(1) makes the term of the extension 8 years, 5 months and 26 days minus five years, which is 3 years, 5 months and 26 days.
This period, added on to the original 20 year term of the Patent expiring on 13 June 2009, would extend the term of the Patent to 9 December 2012.
The Commissioner contends that the Register should reflect this period if Alphapharm's contention as to the first regulatory approval date is correct (see the Lundbeck Appeal (Extension of Term) Proceeding discussed at [45] ff below).
If, on the other hand, the correct first regulatory approval date is 16 September 2003, s 77(1) would make the term of the extension 14 years, 3 months and 3 days minus 5 years, which is 9 years, 3 months and 3 days.
But s 77(2) provides that the term of an extension cannot be longer than five years, and so the term of the extension would be reduced to five years.
This extension of five years, added on to the 20 year term of the Patent expiring on 13 June 2009, would extend that term to 13 June 2014.
This was the extension, particulars of which the Commissioner entered in the Register, that Lundbeck supports (again see the Lundbeck Appeal (Extension of Term) Proceeding discussed at [45] ff below).
Lundbeck's cross-claim against Alphapharm for infringement
 In the Revocation Proceeding, Lundbeck and the exclusive licensee of the Patent in Australia, Lundbeck Australia (together, the Lundbecks) cross-claim against Alphapharm for infringement of the Patent.
A claim was made that certain particulars of the alleged infringement were confidential, but any difficulty on the hearing in this respect was overcome by the co-operation and common sense of the parties (which was a characteristic of the hearing throughout).
The alleged infringement is of product claims 1, 3, and 5 and of method claim 6(b).
The Lundbecks allege that Alphapharm has used, whether for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval to market a pharmaceutical substance in Australia or in other countries or otherwise, manufactured, imported, sold or otherwise disposed of, or offered to import, sell (whether in Australia or elsewhere) or otherwise dispose of, or kept for the purpose of sale, use or other disposition: 
(i) (+)-citalopram or a salt thereof as claimed in claim 1 of the Patent; or
(ii) a pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 3 or claim 5 of the Patent; 
 
or has done any of those acts in respect of a product resulting from the use of the method claimed in claim 6(b) of the Patent, or authorised, procured or induced a person to do any of the acts mentioned above.
In particular, the Lundbecks rely on Alphapharm's threat to manufacture and sell goods containing (+)-citalopram in Australia if Alphapharm obtains the necessary regulatory approvals and listings.
The Lundbecks also rely on steps already taken by Alphapharm in connection with its application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to that end.
Proceeding NSD 1870 of 2005 (the TGA (Protected Information) Proceeding)
 In proceeding NSD 1870 of 2005 (the TGA (Protected Information) Proceeding), Lundbeck Australia seeks a declaration that the information it provided to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing of the Commonwealth of Australia (the Secretary) in respect of its applications for the registration of various therapeutic goods on the ARTG containing the active substance escitalopram oxalate, is "protected information" within the meaning of s 25A(2) of TG Act.
Section 25A provides: 
 
 (1) When evaluating therapeutic goods for registration, the Secretary must not use information about other therapeutic goods that is protected information.

 

 
 
 (2) Information is protected information if:
 (a) the information was given to the Secretary in relation to an application to register therapeutic goods (the new goods ):
 (i) not being therapeutic devices; and
 (ii) consisting of, or containing, an active component; and
 (b) the information is about the active component and is not available to the public; and
 (c) when the application to register the new goods was lodged:
 (i) no other therapeutic goods consisting of, or containing, that active component were included in the Register; and
 (ii) no such therapeutic goods had been included in the Register at any time before then; and
 (d) the new goods became registered on or after the commencement of this subsection; and
 (e) 5 years have not passed since the day the new goods became registered; and
 (f) the person in relation to whom the new goods are registered has not given the Secretary permission in writing for the Secretary to use the information.

 

 
 
 (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), an active component , in relation to therapeutic goods, is a substance that is, or one of the substances that together are, primarily responsible for the biological or other effect identifying the goods as therapeutic goods.

 

 
 
 (4) The use of protected information contrary to subsection (1) does not render the Commonwealth, the Secretary or a delegate of the Secretary liable to a person in respect of loss, damage or injury of any kind suffered by the person as a result of, or arising out of, the use of that information.

 

 In its statement of claim, Lundbeck Australia "particularises" the information it alleges it gave to the Secretary in relation to the registration of Lexapro, which it contends is "protected information" within s 25A of the TG Act (the Information), as follows: 
 
 The Information included information in each of the following categories:
 (a) Chemical, Pharmaceutical and biological information;
 (b) Pharmaco-toxicological information; and
 (c) Clinical information.

 

 Lundbeck Australia seeks, inter alia, prohibition or an injunction prohibiting the Secretary, an officer of the Commonwealth (see s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)), from using the Information or permitting it to be used when evaluating any application by a person other than Lundbeck Australia, notably Alphapharm, for the registration of therapeutic goods pursuant to s 25(1) of the TG Act, for so long as the Information remains protected information within the meaning of s 25A(2).
In pleading that the Secretary threatens and intends to use the Information in evaluating other therapeutic goods for inclusion in the ARTG, Lundbeck Australia is referring to the fact that in the Revocation Proceeding, Alphapharm alleges that if marketing approval is granted, it wishes to manufacture and sell in Australia goods containing (+)-citalopram, and that goods cannot be marketed in Australia unless they are first registered on the ARTG.
Lundbeck Australia complains that it will suffer loss and damage if the Information is not treated by the Secretary as protected, and is used by the Secretary in the evaluation of the therapeutic goods of Alphapharm for registration on the ARTG.
In support, it also refers to the fact that by s 25A(4) of the TG Act, Lundbeck Australia is precluded from recovering any of that loss or damage from the Secretary.
In the course of the proceeding, I ordered that Alphapharm be added as second respondent.
The Secretary and Alphapharm have filed defences.
In substance, they put in issue Lundbeck Australia's allegation that the Information constitutes "protected information" within s 25A(2).
The defences are not identical.
One defence raised by both the Secretary and Alphapharm is that the Information was not protected information as defined in s 25A(2) of the TG Act because para (c) of that subsection was not satisfied because, when the application to register Lexapro was lodged, other therapeutic goods containing the same active component that the Information was about (escitalopram), were already included in the ARTG.
Of course, the other therapeutic goods to which the Secretary and Alphapharm are referring are Cipramil (citalopram hydrobromide), an acid addition salt of the racemate citalopram.
Proceeding NSD 954 of 2006 (the Arrow Proceeding)
 In proceeding NSD 954 of 2006 ("the Arrow Proceeding"), Arrow Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd ("Arrow"), like Alphapharm, seeks a declaration that claims 1 to 6 of the Patent are invalid, an order that they be revoked and that the Register be rectified pursuant to s 192 of the Act by removing the particulars of the Patent from the Register.
In the alternative, Arrow seeks an order that the Register be rectified by removing all record of the extension of the Patent and of the period of the extension, and recording, instead, that the term of the Patent will expire on 13 June 2009, or in the alternative, 9 December 2012.
Arrow also complains that claims 2 to 5 of the Patent are not entitled to a priority date earlier than 13 June 1989, being the date of the filing of the application on which the Patent was granted.
It asserts that those claims are not fairly based on the alleged priority document, namely, the UK Escitalopram Patent.
(However, like Alphapharm, Arrow was content to proceed on the basis of a priority date of 14 June 1988 - see [12] above.
) Arrow asserts that the alleged invention, so far as claimed in claims 1 to 6 of the Patent, is not a patentable invention because it is: not an "invention" or, further or alternatively, not a "manner of manufacture" within s 6 of the Statute of Monopolies (s 18(1)(a) of the Act); not novel (s 18(1)(b)(i) of the Act); obvious (s 18(1)(b)(ii) of the Act); and not useful (s 18(1)(c) of the Act).

Arrow also asserts that the complete specification does not comply with s 40(3) of the Act in that claims 1 to 5 are not clear and succinct and claims 3 to 6 are not fairly based on the matter described in the specification.
Accordingly, Arrow seeks revocation of the Patent under s 138(3) of the Act and removal of the particulars of the Patent from the Register.
In relation to the alternative application for rectification of the Register, like Alphapharm, Arrow alleges that the first regulatory approval date was 9 December 1997, because that was the date when Cipramil was first included in the ARTG, and Cipramil contains citalopram which is a racemic mixture of (+)-citalopram and (-)-citalopram.
Accordingly, like Alphapharm, Arrow complains that it was a misrepresentation for Lundbeck to represent to the Commissioner, as it did when it applied for and obtained the extension, that 16 September 2003 was the relevant first regulatory approval date.
Given the overlap of Arrow Proceeding with the Revocation Proceeding, I find it convenient in these reasons, generally speaking, to refer only to Alphapharm when addressing various issues.
However, it should be understood that my reasoning applies equally to Arrow's submissions on the same issues.
Proceeding NSD 1078 of 2006 (the Lundbeck Appeal (Extension of Term) Proceeding)
 I turn last to proceeding NSD 1078 of 2006 (the Lundbeck Appeal (Extension of Term) Proceeding).
This proceeding is an appeal by Lundbeck from part of a decision of the Commissioner, by her delegate, Dr SD Barker, issued on 19 May 2006.
That decision was a decision to direct that the entry in the Register in respect of the Patent be amended by alteration of the expiry of the extension on the ground that the extended term was not calculated from the "first regulatory approval date" referred to in s 77 of the Act, with the consequence that reg 10.7(7) of the Patents Regulations 1991 (Cth) (the Regulations) required the Commissioner to amend the Register by bringing forward the expiry of the Patent.
(In H Lundbeck A/S v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 163 , I held that reg 10.7(7) was intra vires s 228 of the Act.
Bennett J followed me in Pfizer Corporation v Commissioner of Patents (No 2) (2006) 69 IPR 525 , and on appeal from her Honour, the Full Court agreed with us: see Pfizer Corporation v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCAFC 190 ; (2006) 155 FCR 578.
An application by Pfizer Corporation for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused: see [2007] HCA Trans 93.
) As noted earlier, on 27 May 2004 the Commissioner granted the extension.
No opposition was entered to the grant of it in the time provided by the Regulations.
However, Alphapharm later wrote to the Commissioner asserting that the Commissioner had been misled by Lundbeck as to the true first regulatory approval date.
On 13 July 2005, the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Patents copied Lundbeck into correspondence stating that the Commissioner considered that she was obliged to amend the entry in the Register of the expiry of the term of the Patent from 13 June 2014 to 9 December 2012 under reg 10.7(7) of the Regulations.
This was on the footing that the correct first regulatory approval date was 9 December 1997, the date of the registration of Cipramil in the ARTG.
The Commissioner's letter requested Lundbeck either to provide reasons why the Commissioner should not make the amendment or to accede to the amendment.
Lundbeck did not accede to the amendment and there was a hearing before Dr Barker at which Lundbeck and Alphapharm made submissions.
This led to the decision of 19 May 2006 from which Lundbeck now appeals, as it is entitled to do under s 154 of the Act and reg 10.7(9) of the Regulations.
Regulations 10.7(7) , (8) and (9) provide: 
 
 (7) If:
 (a) an extension of the term of a standard patent for a pharmaceutical substance has been granted under section 76 of the Act; and
 (b) the Commissioner becomes aware that the first regulatory approval date in relation to the pharmaceutical substance is earlier than:
 (i) the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods that was supplied, under subregulation 6.9(2), with the application for the extension of the term; or
 (ii) the date of the first approval that was supplied, under subregulation 6.10(2), with the application for the extension of the term;
 the Commissioner must amend the relevant entry in the Register to insert the correct extension of the term of the patent.

 

 
 
 (8) If the Commissioner proposes to amend an entry in the Register under subregulation (7), the Commissioner must:
 (a) give notice to that effect to the patentee; and
 (b) act in accordance with regulations 22.22 to 22.24 as if those regulations applied to a decision to amend an entry.

 

 
 
 (9) An appeal lies to the Federal Court against a decision of the Commissioner to amend the Register under subregulation (7).

 

 Regulations 22.22 to 22.24 , referred to in para (8)(b), provide for the giving of notice and of an opportunity to be heard, before the Commissioner exercises a discretionary power adversely to a person.
Dr Barker decided that the decision of Wilcox J in Merck  Co Inc v Arrow Pharmaceuticals Ltd [2003] FCA 1344 ; (2003) 59 IPR 226 ( Merck ) governed the issue before him.
As Dr Barker understood the position, Merck produced the result that it did not matter that escitalopram was a new chemical entity having properties different from those of the racemate, citalopram, or that the registration of citalopram under its brand name Cipramil on the ARTG did not give the right to market escitalopram except as part of the racemate.
All that mattered was that Cipramil did in fact "contain" escitalopram, or put another way, that escitalopram was present (to some extent) in Cipramil, and that Cipramil was included in the ARTG.
It was also immaterial, according to Dr Barker, that escitalopram was not responsible for all of the activity of Cipramil.
Dr Barker concluded that since citalopram hydrobromide, marketed under the brand name Cipramil and containing escitalopram, was first registered on the ARTG on 9 December 1997, the Commissioner was required by reg 10.7(7) to amend the relevant entry in the Register to reflect the correct extension of the term of the Patent as expiring on 9 December 2012 (see [32] above).
Lundbeck complains that the Dr Barker erred in finding that the first regulatory approval date was the date on which Cipramil was registered on the ARTG, and that Dr Barker ought to have found that it was the date on which Lexapro was so registered (see [33] above).
Which legislative rgime applies?
The Revocation Proceeding (including the cross-claim for infringement) falls to be decided under the Act.
However, the application for the Patent was filed on 13 June 1989 under the Patents Act 1952 (Cth) (the 1952 Act).
The application for the Patent was advertised and accepted on 7 May 1992.
That was well after the commencement of the Act (being the first day after the end of the period of 6 months beginning on 30 October 1990).
The Patent was therefore granted under the Act on an application lodged under the 1952 Act.
In these circumstances, s 234(2) of the Act is applicable.
That subsection and s 234(5) of the Act relevantly provide: 
 
 (2) Where, before the commencing day:
 (a) a patent application had been lodged under the 1952 Act; and
 (b) a complete specification...had been lodged under that Act in respect of the application; and
 (c) the application had not been withdrawn or finally dealt with;
 then, subject to this Chapter and the regulations, this Act applies on and after that day:
 (d) in relation to the application as if it were a complete application made under this Act; ... 
 

 
 
 (5) Objection cannot be taken to:
 (a) an application mentioned in subsection (2); or
 (b) a patent granted on such an application;
 and such a patent is not invalid, so far as the invention is claimed in any claim, on any ground that would not have been available against the application or patent, as the case may be, under the 1952 Act.

 

 The effect of these provisions is that the Patent can be revoked under the Act only on a ground of invalidity that would have been available under the 1952 Act.
In any case where a relevant ground of invalidity under the 1952 Act is narrower than the corresponding ground under the Act, the patentee has the benefit of the narrower ground and is not to be worse off than if the 1952 Act had continued to operate: NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 404 ; (1993) 44 FCR 239 at 250 ff per Lockhart J, with whom Northrop J agreed and with whom Burchett J agreed on this point; ICI Chemicals  Polymers Ltd v Lubrizol Corporation Inc (2000) 106 FCR 214 ( Lubrizol ) at [22]---[24]; Aktiebolaget Hssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1303 ; (2000) 51 IPR 375 at [8] ---[10].
Professors Banwell and Davies
 Lundbeck and Alphapharm led evidence from a number of experts, not all of whom were cross-examined.
Two of the experts, Professor Martin Banwell called by Alphapharm, and Professor Stephen G Davies called by Lundbeck, conferred and produced a joint report (the Joint Report) in which they responded to six issues that had been formulated by the legal representatives of Alphapharm and Lundbeck.
In response to each issue, they stated matters on which they were agreed, and, where they disagreed, their respective positions.
The legal representatives of Alphapharm and Lundbeck played no part in the Professors' conference or in their formulation of their responses to the six questions.
The Joint Report of Professors Banwell and Davies was admitted in part as Exhibit A9 and, as to the remainder, as Exhibit A10.
Professors Banwell and Davies were sworn in in immediate succession, and in addition to being cross-examined in the conventional manner, they had the opportunity, in a "concurrent evidence" session, to elaborate on their positions and to respond to questions asked by me, as well as to questions asked by each other.
Both Professors Banwell and Davies are highly qualified in the area of organic chemistry.
I discuss their qualifications and experience further at Section E [207] ff.
General chemical background
 In order to understand the issues in these proceedings, it is necessary to have some understanding of organic chemistry.
The following outline is based on the affidavit evidence of Professors Banwell and Davies and on the text, Morrison and Boyd, Organic Chemistry , published by Allyn and Bacon ( Morrison and Boyd ), to which they referred.
At the priority date of 14 June 1988, the 5 th edition of this text, published in 1987, was a standard text for students and organic chemists.
It would be tedious for every phrase or sentence that I quote to be placed within quotation marks and for distinctions to be made between quotation and paraphrase.
I acknowledge, however, my quotation from, and otherwise my reliance on, paras 16 to 56 of Professor Banwell's affidavit sworn 11 August 2006, Annexure 1 to Professor Davies's affidavit sworn 4 April 2007, and Chapters 1 and 4 of Morrison and Boyd .
Atoms and molecules
 Organic chemistry is a specialised branch of chemistry dedicated to the study of molecules that contain carbon atoms.
Atoms are the building blocks of all matter.
They are composed of three types of particles: protons , which carry a positive (+1) charge; neutrons , which carry no charge; and electrons , which carry a negative (---1) charge.
Protons and neutrons are held together by very strong forces and constitute the "nucleus" of an atom.
Electrons orbit the nucleus at different levels.
The chemical elements , such as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, are particular types of atoms.
Each element has a unique number of protons, which, if the element is uncharged, is equal to its number of electrons.
Some elements have a more stable number of electrons than other elements.
Stability is achieved by filling orbitals known as electron shells .
The first electron shell requires two electrons.
The second and third each require eight electrons.
The greatest stability is reached when the outermost electron shell for the particular element is full.
Elements interact with each other in order to achieve a stable number of electrons either by gaining, losing or sharing electrons.
Molecules are combinations of atoms.
They are described by molecular formulae which utilise chemical symbols for each element followed by numeric subscripts for the number of atoms of that element in the molecule.
For example, a molecule of water is shown as H 2 O to signify that the molecule comprises two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one of oxygen (O).
Citalopram comprises the elements hydrogen, oxygen, carbon (C), fluorine (F) and nitrogen (N).
In complicated molecules, groups of atoms with a specific function are called functional groups .
An example in this case is the hydroxyl group (OH).
Atoms are held together in molecules by electron sharing, in a process called covalent bonding.
A covalent bond refers to the sharing of two electrons between two atoms, so that both electrons fall within the outer shell of each atom.
Most elements need to share a certain number of electrons to be stable.
For example, in order to achieve stability, hydrogen, which has one electron and needs to fill the first electron shell (which has a capacity of two electrons), forms one covalent bond; carbon, which has six electrons and needs to fill both the first electron shell and the second electron shell (which has a capacity of eight electrons), forms four covalent bonds; and chlorine (Cl), which has seventeen electrons and needs to fill the first, second and third electron shells, forms one covalent bond.
When an atom of hydrogen reacts with an atom of chlorine, they share one electron with each other to make a covalent bond.
Once this happens, both atoms have a stable number of electrons and a molecule of hydrogen chloride is the result.
Pictorially, a hydrogen chloride molecule (HCl) is represented by a line joining the two atoms to indicate a covalent bond (H---Cl).
Stereochemistry is the study of the three-dimensional structure of molecules.
A molecular formula generally conveys little about how the constituent atoms are physically arranged with respect to each other.
Structural formulae have been developed to convey two-dimensional (2D) and, where appropriate, three-dimensional (3D) arrangements of atoms within a given molecule.
Diagram I below shows several ways of representing the molecule methane.
Within that diagram, Drawing 1 is the molecular formula.
Drawing 2 is a 2D structural formula that shows the connectivity of the atoms, but not their orientation in space.
Drawing 3 is a projection drawing showing the 3D spatial arrangement of the atoms.
The solid wedge indicates that the hydrogen atom at the lower right is coming directly out of the plane of the paper, whereas the broken or hashed wedge shows that the hydrogen atom to the right lies behind the plane of the paper.
Straight lines show bonds in the plane of the paper.
Diagram I --- Various formulaic representations of methane 
 
 
 Isomers and enantiomers 
 Molecules with the same molecular formulae but different connections or different spatial arrangements between atoms are called isomers .
Structural isomers differ in the way in which the atoms are connected together.
In the case of stereoisomers , the atoms are connected in the same way, but the atoms are arranged differently in space.
Stereoisomers behave similarly in many chemical reactions.
However, in some chemical reactions they behave quite differently.
This is particularly the case when stereoisomers interact with molecules within living organisms, such as enzymes within the human central nervous system.
There are two types of stereoisomers: enantiomers and diastereomers.
Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, much like a person's left hand and right hand.
Diastereomers are not mirror images of each other and have different physical and chemical properties.
Objects that have a non-superimposable mirror image, such as human hands, are chiral .
A chiral molecule can exist in two isomeric forms, each of which is the mirror image of the other, that it to say, is not superimposable on the other.
An achiral molecule lacks that feature: its isomeric forms are superimposable on one another.
In organic chemistry, a molecule that contains a carbon atom bonded to four different atoms or functional groups is chiral.
For example, the molecule bromochlorofluoromethane is chiral because it has bromine (Br), chlorine, fluorine and hydrogen atoms attached to the central carbon atom.
In Diagram II below, Drawing 4 shows the 2D structure of bromochlorofluoromethane and Drawings 5 and 6 show the 3D structures of the two enantiomers.
Diagram II --- 2D structure (4) and two enantiomers (5 and 6) 
 of bromochlorofluoromethane 
 4 5 
 Mirror 6 It is common ground that in 1988, an ordinary skilled but non-inventive chemist, being given a 2D structural formula with a single chiral centre (such as Drawing 4) would recognise the presence of two enantiomers (Drawings 5 and 6).
The 2D structural formula would represent either a single enantiomer or, if the molecule was part of a mixture, the two enantiomers in either equal or unequal parts.
It is also common ground that if that chemist was also given some background to the origin of the molecule or mixture, the chemist would be able to determine which of those situations applied.
This is because of what was known about how enantiomers are produced.
Generally speaking, chiral molecules exist in nature only as one enantiomer.
However, when chiral molecules are synthesised in a laboratory, there is a 50% probability that either enantiomer will be produced, so the two enantiomers are produced in equal parts.
The resultant mixture is known as a racemate or racemic mixture .
It may be a solid, liquid or gas.
To obtain an unequal mixture of the enantiomers, or a single enantiomer, some specific step must be taken in the synthesis ( enantio-selective synthesis ).
Labelling enantiomers as (+) or (-) and as R or S
 .
There are two conventions for describing enantiomers.
The first depends on the physical property of the rotation of plane-polarised light ( optical activity ).
Enantiomers rotate plane-polarised light in opposite directions.
Enantiomers are designated (+) (dextrorotatory) or (-) (levorotatory) on the basis of whether, in solution, they rotate plane-polarised light clockwise (to the right) or anti-clockwise (to the left), respectively.
Because enantiomers rotate plane-polarised light in opposite directions to equal extents, a racemate has no net rotation of plane-polarised light.
It is optically inactive.
The second way of describing enantiomers is an abstract theoretical description (as distinct from requiring physical testing) and provides an absolute configuration .
Enantiomers are designated R or S on the basis of the direction of rotation when the molecule is abstractly positioned according to certain standard rules (the Cahn Ingold Prelog (CIP) rules).
The rules are based on the atomic number (number of protons) of each atom or functional group connected to the chiral centre.
First, each atom or functional group is labelled 1 to 4, with 1 indicating the highest atomic number and 4 indicating the lowest atomic number.
Second, the molecule is visualised so that the atom or group labelled 1 (and so having the lowest atomic number) is directed into the page.
Third, a curved arrow is drawn from the 1 position to the 2 position and then to the 3 position, and from the 3 position to the 4 position.
If the arrow points clockwise, the configuration is designated R (Latin: rectus , right); if it points anticlockwise, the configuration is designated S (Latin: sinister , left).
Diagram III below shows the two enantiomers of bromochlorofluoromethane, reoriented so that the atom with the lowest atomic number (H) is facing away from the page.
The enantiomers are designated R and S based on the descending priority of the other three elements.
Diagram III --- 3D structure and R and S designations of two enantiomers (7 and 8) 
 of bromochlorofluoromethane 
 
 
 7 8 It is common ground that in 1988, an ordinary skilled but non-inventive chemist, being given a 2D structural formula with a single chiral centre, could, by applying the CIP rules, have drawn the absolute configuration of each of the two enantiomers, R and S. Application to citalopram
 The following is the 2D structural formula of citalopram: Diagram IV --- 2D structural formula of citalopram 
 
 
 This formula uses a convention for organic molecules where carbon and hydrogen molecules are not identified by symbols.
For example, each of the lines surrounding the N (nitrogen) on the right side of the structure represents a bond to a carbon atom, which is itself bonded to two or three hydrogen atoms.
The hydrogen atoms never appear in such formulae.
Because each carbon atom must have four covalent bonds, bonds to hydrogen atoms are inferred if a junction has less than four bonds emanating from it.
The hexagon 'rings' contain carbon atoms at each junction.
Double bonds between carbon atoms are indicated by double lines and single bonds by single lines.
The carbon atoms at each junction are also bonded either to another carbon atom (indicated by a bond ending in a junction), a fluorine atom (indicated by --- F) or a hydrogen (not represented by symbol).
It is not in dispute that, based on the principles referred to above, including the CIP rules, a chemist could, at the priority date, identify from the formula in Diagram IV: four different chemical groups attached to a common carbon (the carbon being, by definition, a centre of chirality); and the R and S enantiomers of the compound.

Furthermore, a chemist could, at the priority date, depict the R and S enantiomers of citalopram, but not which of them would be the (+)-enantiomer and (-)-enantiomer.
There is no fixed relationship between the R and S dichotomy and the (+) and (-) dichotomy.
It is only as a result of testing with plane-polarised light that one can know which of the R and S enantiomers is the (+)-enantiomer and which is the (-)-enantiomer.
Major Depressive Disorder and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
 Depression, and in particular, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder.
Its basis is thought to be a disruption of normal neural transmission.
Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter which allows messages to be transmitted between nerves.
By the priority date of the Patent, it was understood that neurotransmission by, relevantly, serotonin was comparatively deficient in MDD sufferers.
It was thought that if the reuptake of 5-HT by nerve cells could be inhibited, there would be more free 5-HT in the synapses between the nerve cells, and that this additional 5-HT would improve neurotransmission and therefore give relief from MDD.
Citalopram and escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs).
The term "selective" implies the avoidance of undesirable side effects.
Citalopram and escitalopram are compounds that selectively block only the uptake of 5-HT.
In 1988, there were no SSRIs on the market, although some had been launched previously and withdrawn due to toxicity, while others were being developed.
Fluoxetine (sold under the brand name "Prozac"), paroxetine (sold under the brand name "Seroxat"), and citalopram were early SSRIs.
Fluoxetine and citalopram were racemates and paroxetine was a single enantiomer.
Citalopram was considered to be the most selective of these SSRIs.
Since 1988, other SSRIs have been introduced, including escitalopram.
SECTION B --- THE PATENT 
 The various earlier patents
 I find it convenient to list here the various patents which were referred to in the evidence.
They fall into three groups: the patents for the racemic mixture citalopram having both the (+) and (-) enantiomers in equal portions (the Citalopram Patents); the patents for the intermediate diol (the Diol Patents); and the patents for the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram, which is in fact the S-enantiomer or escitalopram (the Escitalopram Patents).

The EU Escitalopram Patent, being European patent No 0 347 066, based on the application for the UK Escitalopram Patent being for "New enantiomers and their isolation".
(The validity of the EU Escitalopram Patent has been the subject of three decisions: The Australian Escitalopram Patent, being Australian patent No 623144 dated 9 June 1989 (application filed on 13 June 1989), based on the application for the UK Escitalopram Patent, being for "(+) Enantiomer of Citalopram and process for the preparation thereof" --- the Patent.

(The validity of this US Re-issued Escitalopram Patent was the subject of a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware given on 13 July 2006 in Forest Laboratories Inc v Ivax Pharmaceuticals Inc 438 F Supp 2d 479 (2006) and of the decision on appeal from that decision, given on 5 September 2007 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Forest Laboratories Inc v Ivax Pharmaceuticals Inc 501 F 3d 1263 (2007).
) The complete specification of the Patent
 I will now summarise the content of the complete specification of the Patent.
I set out the claims of the Patent at [10] above.
The specification states that "the present invention relates to the two novel enantiomers of the antidepressant drug 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3,-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile (citalopram) of the following formula I: 
 
 
and to the use of these enantiomers as antidepressant compounds as well as the possible use as geriatrics [sic --- their possible use with geriatrics] or in the cure of obesity or alcoholism".
The specification states that the invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the enantiomers of compound I (being a compound of the formula I set out above), and gives examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable organic salts and inorganic salts.
The specification states that the invention is also concerned with the method to resolve the racemate of I into the individual isomers.
In this context, "the individual isomers" means the individual enantiomers.
According to the specification, citalopram, the racemate, was disclosed in the US Citalopram Patent.
The US Citalopram Patent is the US equivalent of the Australian Citalopram Patent, on which Alphapharm relies as an anticipation of the Patent.
Both the US Citalopram Patent and the Australian Citalopram Patent were based on the UK Citalopram Patent (see [79] above).
The specification states that citalopram has proved to be an efficient antidepressant compound in man, and has been shown pharmacologically to be a very selective inhibitor of 5-HT reuptake.
The specification states that previous attempts to crystallise diastereomeric salts of citalopram enantiomers have failed.
This calls for some explanation.
A conventional approach to the resolution of a racemate is to attempt to react it with a chiral organic acid (resolving agent) prepared as a single enantiomer.
The theory is that the two enantiomers of the racemate will form two different diastereomeric salts with the single enantiomer of the acid.
Diastereomers were discussed at [68] above.
Diastereomers can have different physical and chemical properties.
One of the properties which may differ between the diastereomeric salts is the propensity to crystallise, and it is possible by means of this difference to isolate one of the diastereomeric salts.
As Dr Bges of Lundbeck explained in his affidavit: "....if suitable conditions can be found to exploit [the propensity to crystallise], it is possible to crystallize out of solution only one of the diastereomeric salts...the isolated salt may then be recrystallized and then transformed into the free base which again may be transformed to a salt and crystallized, thereby isolating a single pure enantiomer of the originally racemic material".
This technique is called fractional crystallisation.
There are two prerequisites for success in using fractional crystallisation.
First, it is necessary that crystals be obtained, and this is not assured.
Second, it is necessary that the diastereomers have different degrees of solubility for preferential crystallisation of one enantiomer to occur.
As will be noted below, Dr Bges gave evidence that his attempts to separate the enantiomers of citalopram in this way had been unsuccessful, principally because he could not obtain crystallisation, and on the one occasion when he did obtain it (with (+)-camphorsulfonic acid), separation was not obtained.
The specification states, however, that "[s]urprisingly, it has now proven possible to resolve the intermediate 4-(4-dimethylamino)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1-(hydroxy-1-butyl)-3-hydroxymethyl) benzonitrile, II, into its enantiomers and finally in a stereoselective way to convert these enantiomers to the corresponding citalopram enantiomers.
" The process just described (and described in more detail below) was referred to as "Reaction Scheme II" before me.
Formula II, referred to above, is as follows: 
 
 
 

This formula II is of the intermediate diol of citalopram.
Reaction Scheme II thus consists of a resolution of this diol into its own enantiomers and then, in a stereoselective way, a conversion of those enantiomers to the enantiomers of citalopram.
The intermediate racemic diol (II) was disclosed in, for example, the US Diol Patent.
The US Diol Patent is the equivalent of the Australian Diol Patent, and both the US and the Australian Diol Patents were based on the UK Diol Patent (see [79] above).
A "Reaction Scheme I" (described in more detail below) is also referred to in the specification.
Reaction Scheme I reads: "Likewise, monoesters of II formed by optically active carboxylic acids could be separated into the corresponding diastereomers and subsequently converted directly into citalopram enantiomers in a stereoselective ringclosure reaction".
The "optically active carboxylic acid" that featured in the case was "Mosher's Reagent" or "Mosher's acid chloride".
The "intermediate" or "precursor" diol was the essence of both Reaction Schemes I and II.
The reference to "stereoselective" in both Reaction Schemes signifies the importance of stereoselectivity in the step from the enantiomer of the diol (in Reaction Scheme II) or monoesters of the diol (in Reaction Scheme I) to the enantiomer of citalopram.
The ringclosure reaction had to be, in general terms, one that enabled optical activity to be retained, and racemisation (or "re-racemisation") to be avoided.
According to the specification it was shown, surprisingly, that almost the entire 5-HT uptake inhibition resided in the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram.
Reaction Scheme I is depicted in the specification as follows (I have taken the liberty of indicating with square brackets and arrows on the diagram certain features of the reaction): 
 
 The racemic diol (which is compound II --- see [90] above) is depicted at the top of the diagram.
It includes at the top left a benzonitrile ring.
Attached to the right of this ring is hydroxyl methyl (CH 2 OH), which is a primary alcohol (the carbon in the alcohol being bonded to one other carbon).
Below that is a further alcohol comprised of the hydroxyl group (OH) and the carbon (C), which is a tertiary alcohol (the carbon being bonded to three other carbons).
The bottom ring is a flourophenyl ring.
The difficulty has resided in the point at which ring closure is to occur.
The challenge is to maintain stereoselectivity, that is to say, to avoid racemisation.
The first step is to react compound II (the diol) with an enantiomerically pure acid derivative in either its (+) or (-) form.
The agent shown in Reaction Scheme I is in fact Mosher's acid chloride.
The diastereoisomers are subsequently separated by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).
(I discuss HPLC in more detail at Section E [302] ff.
For now, it suffices to say that HPLC, like fractional crystallisation referred to above, is a method that can be used to obtain the individual enantiomers from a racemate.
) What one gets following separation by HPLC is a pure diastereometric form of Mosher's ester.
The "H", which can be seen in the primary alcohol group (CH 2 OH) does not appear in the Mosher's ester, and the chloride (Cl) which appears in the Mosher's acid chloride also does not appear in the Mosher's ester.
The hydrochloric acid (HCl) that leaves is referred to as the "liberated HCl".
Finally, the purified diastereoisomers referred to in the preceding paragraph are each treated with a strong base in an inert organic solvent, such as toluene, to yield the separated positive (+) or negative (-) enantiomers of citalopram (as the case may be).
The (+)-enantiomer and (---)-enantiomer of citalopram ultimately obtained appear at the foot of the diagram.
In each case the letter O (oxygen) indicates the point at which ring closure takes place.
The ring closure is preferably performed at a relatively low temperature, minus 20 o C to room temperature.
If the reaction between the Mosher's ester and the strong base takes place at too warm a temperature, ring closure becomes fast and spontaneous, and a racemate, rather than the pure enantiomers, can form.
The problem with Reaction Scheme I was that Mosher's acid chloride was very expensive.
Once those concerned worked out what was happening with the Mosher's acid chloride, they progressed to Reaction Scheme II, to which I now turn.
Reaction Scheme II is depicted in the specification as follows (again, I have taken the liberty of indicating with square brackets and arrows on the diagram certain features of the reaction): 
 
One commences with either the (+)-enantiomer or the (---)-enantiomer of the diol.
The (+)-enantiomer or the (---)-enantiomer has already been obtained by the beginning of the diagram.
They have been obtained by reacting the racemic diol with an optically active acid (examples given in the specification include the respective enantiomers of tartaric acid and di-(p-toloyl)tartaric acid).
The first step shown in the diagram is the addition of an acid chloride (in this case methanesulfonyl) to the enantiomer of the diol, and, simultaneously, a base (in this case triethylamine) in an inert organic solvent at 0 o C. The final product, depicted at the foot of the diagram, is the pure enantiomer (either the (-) or (+) enantiomer) of citalopram.
If the starting product was the (+)-enantiomer of the diol, the end product is (---)-citalopram.
If with the starting product was the (---)-enantiomer, the end product is (+)-citalopram.
The point at which ring closure takes place is indicated in the formula at the foot of the diagram by O (oxygen).
The square brackets in the diagram indicate that the product within them is an intermediate product.
It is a labile ester and is not stable.
It is formed during the course of the reaction.
The process from the addition of the acid chloride to the pure form of the enantiomer of citalopram being a continuous one.
The specification gives examples of the implementation of Reaction Scheme I (Example 1 at p 6) and Reaction Scheme II (Example 2 at pp 7-8).
Example 3 is not relevant.
At pp 9-12 of the specification is an account of the inhibition of 3 H-serotonin uptake in rat brain synaptosomes, including a table of the pharmacological test results.
I need not set them out or discuss them in detail.
As a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor, (+)-citalopram is shown to be a little more effective than citalopram itself and more than 100 times more effective than (-)-citalopram.
At p 12 of the specification there is discussion of dosage forms, and at pp 12-13, a discussion of the preparation of tablets, and of a solution for injection.
The Patent ends with the claims at pp 16-17 which were set out at [10] above.
As will be recalled, claims 1 to 5 are product claims.
Claim 6 is a claim of the two methods of obtaining (+)-citalopram, which have referred to earlier as Reaction Scheme I (Claim 6(a)) and Reaction Scheme II (Claim 6(b)).
As previously noted, Lundbeck's cross claim of infringement rests on claim 6(b) --- Reaction Scheme II.
SECTION C --- CONSTRUCTION OF THE PATENT 
 General
 Claims 1, 3, 5 and 6 are the subject of Alphapharm's invalidity attack.
Alphapharm has no interest in the pamoic acid salts of claims 2 and 4.
It may be, however, that those two claims stand or fall with claim 1.
It is common ground that if Alphapharm's construction argument should succeed, claims 1, 3 and 5 would be invalid.
Alphapharm's attack based on lack of novelty is closely related to the question of the proper construction of the Patent.
I will discuss below the extensive submissions that were addressed to the construction issue, but I will state at once my conclusion.
The symbol (+)- in claim 1 (and in claim 2) indicates the particular enantiomer that is distinguished by the feature of rotating plane-polarised light to the right (under standard conditions --- see Section G below).
The property of rotating plane-polarised light to the right (clockwise) or to the left (anticlockwise) which distinguishes one enantiomer from the other and each from the racemate, is able to be detected only when that enantiomer is present other than as a part of the racemate.
This is because when in a racemic mixture, the polarisation of light by each enantiomer is "cancelled out" by the other enantiomer, and there is thus no net polarisation of light.
The skilled addressee in 1988 would have understood claim 1 to refer specifically to (+)-citalopram.
In the absence of a context permitting otherwise, the skilled addressee would not have understood the claim to the invention of (+)-citalopram to refer to that compound merely as part of the unresolved racemate.
Rather, the skilled addressee would have understood the claim to the invention of (+)-citalopram to refer to that compound as something that had an existence independent of that of the racemate.
The only context that I take into account in arriving at this conclusion is that it was part of common general knowledge: It is not that the (+)-citalopram compound does not exist when it is part of the racemate.
The skilled addressee would understand that it exists whether a part of the racemate or apart from it, and that the purpose of the (+) symbol is only to distinguish it from the (---)-enantiomer and from its being merely part of the racemate or of some other mixture.
The (+) or (---) symbol, devoid of any context suggesting otherwise, implies distinctness from the racemate.
Analogies are usually imperfect and are often only alternative ways of posing the problem to be solved.
Nonetheless, the following two analogies are, I think, illuminating.
First, take a reference to "blue" or to "yellow".
It is understood to signify something different from "green".
Yet green is said to consist of blue and yellow.
Again, take a reference to a "black stick figure in a black square frame".
That description is not met by the same square entirely black.
Yet when the black stick figure is one of a sufficient number of (say 1,000) different black stick figures all drawn within the same frame, the resulting solid black square can be said to contain the initial black stick figure, although we can no longer see it.
So, the unqualified reference to the (+)-enantiomer of citalopram in claim 1 refers to something different from that enantiomer as an indistinguishable part of the unresolved racemate.
My construction, independently arrived at, accords with that of District Judge Keeley in Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc v Mylan Laboratories Inc 348 F Supp 2d 713.
Her Honour had to construe a claim of "An S(---)-pyridobenzoxazine compound represented by [a certain formula]".
Her Honour said (at 726): 
 
 Thus, while it is certainly necessary to distinguish a new invention over the prior art, there is no indication that an inventor must use a plain-English purity limitation, as Mylan contends.
Instead, an inventor may use anything that a person skilled in the relevant art would understand to limit the claim.
In this case, the term "S(---)" clearly and plainly limits the claim language to the levorotatory enantiomer.
Those skilled in the art clearly understand the term "S(---)" to affirmatively denote only the levorotatory enantiomer of a racemic compound, and not the racemic compound itself.

 

 
Later (at 729-730) Keeley J said that those skilled in the art would have understood the claim to cover "levofloxacin with a purity that was highly, but less than 100%, optically pure".
Her Honour's observations apply mutatis mutandis to the present case.
While my construction would leave unanswered the question how much "impurity" would prevent a compound from meeting the formula in claim 1 (see below), it does establish that when the compound is present only as 50% of a racemate, it does not meet the description in claim 1.
The construction outlined above is also supported by the body of the specification and a certain convention in the way in which chemists understand references to compounds, both discussed below, but does not depend on those two additional considerations.
I rely on them as alternative bases for my construction if I am wrong in thinking that claim 1 is unambiguous.
Rules of construction
 The parties' written submissions referred to numerous authorities on the construction of patents, and, in particular, on the construction of patent claims.
I need not refer to more than the following: The construction of a specification is a question of law and belongs to the Court: Hill v Evans (1862) 1A IPR 1 ( Hill v Evans ) at 3; The Court must construe the specification as it would be understood by the notional skilled addressee as at the relevant date: Hill v Evans at 3-4; Dcor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 ( Dcor ) at 400; Flexible Steel Lacing Co v Beltreco Ltd [2000] FCA 890 ; (2000) 49 IPR 331 ( Flexible Steel Lacing ) at [81]; Evidence from a skilled addressee in the field of the invention as to how he or she would have understood the specification at the relevant date is relevant evidence for the purposes of s 55(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (Evidence Act): EI Dupont De Nemours  Co v Imperial Chemicals Industries plc [2002] FCA 230 ; (2002) 54 IPR 304 at 320-322; Flexible Steel Lacing at [81]; Clorox Australia Pty Ltd v International Consolidated Business Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 254 at [21]; Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 980 ; (2000) 177 ALR 231 at [49] ; The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, and the rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in the resolving of ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at [16]; Sachtler GmbH  Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 788 ; (2005) 65 IPR 605 ( Sachtler ) at [42]; A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction, and must be construed in a practical commonsense manner avoiding a too technical or narrow construction in favour of a construction under which the invention will work, as against one according to which it may not work: Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56; Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Ely Lilly  Co [2005] FCAFC 224 ; (2005) 225 ALR 416 ( Pfizer v Eli Lilly ) at [249]-[250]; The hypothetical addressee of the patent is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date, and the words used in the specification and the claims are to be given the meanings that that skilled addressee would give them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at [20]; Dcor at 391; PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston [2005] FCA 344 ; (2005) 216 ALR 41 at [170] .
Professors Banwell and Davies on the meaning that the Patent claims would convey to the hypothetical skilled chemist at the priority date
 Issue 5 in the Joint Report related to the construction of claim 1.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) posed the following questions to Professors Banwell and Davies: 
 
 (a) Does the reference in Claim 1 to (+)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile denote any level of purity?
(b) If so, what level of purity does it denote and why?

 

 The reference to "purity" is a reference to the purity of the positive enantiomer compound.
The questions predicate the issue whether the reference in claim 1 to the (+)-enantiomer includes a reference to that enantiomer in the racemic mixture.
Professors Banwell and Davies agreed that (+)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile denotes a specific single enantiomeric form of the compound and not the racemate.
Professor Banwell stated that "purity is irrelevant as it is a claim in a patent".
Professor Davies, on the other hand, stated that with no other information, the reference in claim 1 denotes material of at least 95% enantiomeric purity (see below).
In their Joint Report, Professors Banwell and Davies addressed question 5(c) which was as follows: 
 
 Is there a convention among chemists that when the absolute purity of a "pure" compound is not specified, it is understood to mean "at least 95% pure"?
If so, where in the standard literature (as at 1988) can that convention be found?

 

 
They gave a common answer as follows:
 
 
 In the open literature and particularly when dealing with experimental matters the claims to single compounds where no purity is given , or where they are described as "pure" (eg enantiomerically or chemically pure) are by convention understood to indicate at least 95% pure.
This convention is not specifically stated in the literature but was in 1988 and indeed [is] today the standard benchmark arising from the limits of the techniques used to establish purity.
This convention is generally practised throughout the chemical literature including in the publications of both MGB [Professor Banwell] and SGD [Professor Davies].
[my emphasis] 
 

 
The question was posed in relation to "pure" compounds.
I understand the question and the Professors' common answer to extend to compounds, such as that in claim 1, "where no purity is given", that is, where no explicit reference to purity is made.
A possible alternative interpretation is that question and answer refer only to the situation where the compound is described as "pure" but no numerical specification as to the level of purity is given.
In that case, the question and answer would not be relevant to claim 1.
I reject this alternative.
The Professors had claim 1 before them and must be taken to have expressed their agreement (above) and disagreement (see below) by reference to it.
In any event, the Joint Report was overtaken to some extent by the oral evidence referred to below.
Asked, whether claim 1 of the Patent referred to at least 95% enantiomerically pure S-citalopram (question 5(d) of their Joint Report), the two Professors disagreed.
Professor Banwell answered "No", again explaining that purity is irrelevant because the claim is a claim in a patent.
Professor Davies answered "Yes", adding that a chemist will automatically apply the convention wherever a compound's name occurs.
The disagreement between the two Professors was elaborated upon in their affidavits.
Professor Davies stated: 
 
 Claim 1 of the Patent would be understood to mean the individual, ie enantiomerically pure (+) enantiomer of citalopram.
By enantiomerically pure I mean at least 95% pure.
I say at least 95% because the established convention among medicinal chemists is that when the absolute purity of a "pure" compound is not specified, it is understood to mean "at least 95% pure".
This is because the standard method for measuring purity (including optical purity) (NMR) can only reliably detect impurities if they are present at a level of 5% or greater.
I believe that any medicinal chemist reading the claim would have this understanding of this claim, both now and in 1988.

 

 
In response, Professor Banwell stated: 
 
 
 Claim 1 of the Patent claims (+)-1-(3-dimethylamionoproply)-1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile as well as non-toxic acid addition salts of that enantiomer.
In my view, Claim 1 refers to the single (+) enantiomer in the form of the free base or the salt.
In this context purity is not a relevant concept.
You either have the (+) enantiomer, or you do not have the (+) enantiomer.

 

 Lundbeck submits that Professor Banwell's assertion that purity is irrelevant because we are concerned here with a claim in a patent is the expression of a legal opinion of which Professor Banwell is not entitled to give evidence.
Professor Banwell would be entitled to give evidence, if his experience qualified him to do so, that the formulae of chemical compounds are in fact understood differently by chemists according to whether they appear in patents or in other documents, but that was not his evidence.
I think that Professor Banwell meant that while he agreed that formulae of single compounds in the open literature (such as journal articles) are understood as importing the concept of 95% purity, he reserved his position as to patents, no doubt because his experience did not enable him to say whether chemists would apply the 95% purity convention to their reading of patents.
Professor Davies said that he had "no knowledge or experience" of a convention according to which chemists read patents differently from the open literature, and Professor Banwell gave no evidence of the existence of such a convention.
While it is not necessary for me to resolve this difference in view of my conclusion expressed at [116], [125] above, I see no reason why an exception is to be made in the case of patents.
If chemists understand a formula for a single compound when it appears in the open literature to have a certain meaning, why would they not read the same formula in a patent in the same way, at least in the absence of an indication to the contrary in the specification?
Since there is no evidence that they would not, I infer that they would.
Senior counsel for Alphapharm suggested that in his affidavit (see [132] above), Professor Davies was saying that the 95% purity criterion applies only when some such qualifier as "pure" or "individual" appears.
Senior counsel for Alphapharm submitted that Professor Davies departed from that more limited proposition to the more general one that an unqualified reference to the formula of a single compound imports the 95% purity qualification.
Professor Davies was cross-examined at some length on this matter.
He agreed with senior counsel for Alphapharm that if, in the open literature, there was an express reference to the "pure" or "individual" enantiomer, the skilled reader would take the reference to be a 95+% pure enantiomer.
Senior counsel for Alphapharm drew Professor Davies's attention to the fact that claim 1 did not say "individual" or "pure".
Professor Davies's response was two-fold.
First, he pointed out that the specification elsewhere used the words "pure" and "individual" in the present context.
In fact it does, as appears in some of the extracts referred to at [141] below.
Second, Professor Davies stated that in any event, even without any express reference to "individual" or "pure", a 95+% level of purity is understood.
He said: 
 
 ... if you go to a catalogue, a chemical catalogue, and you buy a compound +x, you would expect that to be more than 95% pure unless something else was stated.
So when you're stating a single --- a compound with a descriptor like "+" in this case, then you expect it to be that enantiomer of 95% or above.

 

and
 
 
 ... if I buy a compound from a chemical catalogue that says "compound X", I would expect it to be 95% or more in purity.
Otherwise that would tell me in the description.
If it is "(+)-citalopram" in a chemical catalogue, I would expect it to be 95% or more.

 

 
Professor Davies also stated:
 
 
 ... if I go to a chemical catalogue and buy something, I expect it to be 95% or more pure.
Otherwise, the person selling it to me would make it clear to me that it was not so pure.

 

 In my opinion, the effect of Professor Davies's testimony, which I accept, is that chemists at the priority date and now would understand the bare formula of claim 1 to require a compound that was at least 95% pure (+)-citalopram.
There was in evidence a commercial catalogue of chemicals available for purchase, and Alphapharm pointed to specifications of purity levels in it, nearly all of them being higher than 95%.
Alphapharm's suggestion seems to be that Professor Davies's evidence related to a hypothetical situation because a level of purity is always specified.
However, this one catalogue does not establish Alphapharm's proposition.
If anything, I think the catalogue supports Professor Davies's evidence, because it at least suggests that chemists expect a very high level of purity, far higher than 50%.
I accept Professor Davies's evidence that in the absence of the specification of a level of purity, the convention of "at least 95%" applies.
I also accept that the convention is applicable to the formula stated in claim 1.
The body of the specification
 Lundbeck refers to numerous references in the specification, outside the claims themselves, as supporting the view that claim 1 is to the isolated (+)-enantiomer: 
 
 (a) the title: "(+)-Enantiomer of Citalopram and process for the preparation thereof", that is not both enantiomers as part of a racemate; 
 

 
 
 (b) page 1, lines 1-5 --- "the two novel enantiomers ... and to the use of these enantiomers as antidepressant compound", that is, not the use of the enantiomers as part of the racemate; 
 

 
 
 (c) page 2, lines 12-13 --- "the invention is also concerned with a method to resolve the racemate ... into the individual enantiomers"; 
 

 
 
 (d) page 2, line 14 --- the acknowledgement of the racemate in the prior art; 
 

 
 
 (e) page 3, lines 4-6 the discovery that almost the entire 5-HT uptake inhibition resided "in the (+) citalopram enantiomer" --- this is something which is only measurable at the macroscopic level and on the isolated enantiomer; 
 

 
 
 (f) page 3, lines 9-10 --- the production of the enantiomer from the enantiomerically pure diol --- "with fully [sic] conservation of stereoconfiguration";
 (g) The description of the method at page 3, line 20-21 --- "yielding the pure citalopram enantiomers"; 
 

 
 
 (h) Page 4 --- Reaction scheme I starting with racemic diol and ending separately with the (+) and (-) enantiomers.
