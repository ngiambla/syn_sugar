 
1 In this matter on 27 March 2008 reasons for decision were published allowing an appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal given on 3 October 2007: Comcare v Davies [2008] FCA 393.
2 One of the orders then made was that the decision of the Tribunal was to be set aside.
Liberty was reserved for the parties to apply within seven days should one or the other seek to have the orders varied.
That liberty was not invoked but the orders as made on 27 March 2008 have not yet been entered.
3 Today, however, an oral application was made in accordance with O 35(7)(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) to vary Order 3 as made on 27 March 2008.
The application is supported by both parties.
4 Order 3 of the orders made on 27 March 2008 was that:
 3.
The matter be remitted to the Tribunal for further consideration in accordance with law.
5 Pursuant to Order 35(7)(1) that Order is now varied such that the order in lieu thereof is as follows:
 
3.
The matter be remitted to the Tribunal for further consideration in accordance with law for the determination of the following issues:
 
 
 (a) What may constitute suitable employment other than the Respondent's Bali Gardens business; and
 (b) The quantification of the Respondent's ability to earn.

 


 
6 There will be no order for costs as to the application this morning.
