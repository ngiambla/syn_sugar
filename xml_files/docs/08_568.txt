 
1 This proceeding is concerned with the construction of s 170(10AA) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ( the 1936 Act ).
Section 170(10AA), in conjunction with s 170(1), confers power on the respondent, the Commissioner of Taxation ( the Commissioner ), to amend a notice of assessment in circumstances, relevantly, where disposal of an asset pursuant to a contract for sale is deemed to have occurred when the contract was made rather than when the actual disposal occurred.
The question is relevant to a notice of amended assessment issued by the Commissioner to the applicant, Metlife Insurance Ltd ( the Taxpayer ), in respect of a liability for capital gains tax.
The notice of amended assessment was issued after the actual disposal of the relevant asset.
2 By consent, the Court made an order on 14 December 2007, pursuant to Order 29 Rule 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules , that the question of construction be decided separately from, and in advance of, the hearing of all other issues in the proceeding.
The Taxpayer and the Commissioner have agreed on the facts that are relevant to the question.
Before stating the question and the agreed facts, I shall describe the relevant statutory framework.
In the light of the contentions of the Taxpayer, I shall also say something about the legislative history of some of the relevant provisions.
