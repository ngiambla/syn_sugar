 
1 I have before me an amended application by Len Watson, Vassa Hunter and Nancy Riehl jointly on behalf of the Wiri People ("the applicant") to review a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Native Title Registrar ("the Registrar") not to accept the Wiri People #2 Claimant Application (QUD 6251 of 1998) ("the Wiri #2 Application") for registration under section 190A Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act ").
The decision was made by the delegate on 24 May 2007.
The jurisdiction of the Court to review a decision of the Registrar not to accept a claim for registration is enlivened by s 190D of the Act , with the Court being seized of broad powers pursuant to that section ( Western Australia v Strickland [2000] FCA 652 ; (2000) 99 FCR 33 at 49-50).
2 The relief sought by the applicant is as follows :
 
A.
An order setting aside the decision of the Registrar to not accept the Wiri #2 Application for registration effective as from 24 May 2007
 
B.
An order directing the Registrar to accept the Wiri #2 Application for registration and include in the Register of Native Title claims details of the application with effect from 24 May 2007
 
C. Such other orders as the Court thinks just and necessary.
BACKGROUND 
 
3 The Wiri #2 Application was first entered on the Native Title Register on 2 April 1998.
The application covered a broad area of country in Central Queensland, the eastern boundary of which abutted and extended to offshore islands beyond the coastline to the north and south of Mackay and the western boundary of which was located well inland of the coastline.
4 On 30 September 1998 section 190A was amended to subject native title applications to a registration test.
In 1999 and 2000 the Wiri #2 Application was amended to decrease the country to "all parcels of unallocated state land" within the original broad area of country.
Each amendment was subjected to the registration test and each amendment was successful in being registered.
5 The Wiri #2 Application was again amended on 7 November 2006 and referred by the Court to the Registrar on 10 November 2006.
