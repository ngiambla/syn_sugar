 
1 These are the reasons for judgment for final orders I made on 14 December 2007.
In these reasons I have drawn heavily on written submissions made by the parties before the hearing on 14 December 2007.
I will do so without further detailed attribution.
The matter involves a dispute between two battery manufacturers (it is a gloss on the evidence to describe them as manufacturers but the details are immaterial).
One alleges the other was advertising and otherwise promoting for sale its batteries in a way that involved misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Act").
The impugned advertising and promotional material involved a comparison between the performance of the respondent's batteries and the performance of the applicant's batteries.
2 The history of the litigation is as follows.
On 28 November 2007, the applicant approached the duty judge who granted leave to the applicant to file the application, statement of claim and affidavits in support and made the matter returnable before the duty judge at 2.15pm on 30 November 2007 for the hearing of the claim for interlocutory relief.
An order was also made that certain of the applicant's exhibits (including the results of tests conducted by the applicant on the respondent's batteries) remain confidential to the external legal representatives of the respondent until further order.
3 On 30 November 2007, the respondent informed the Court that it was not ready to proceed with an interlocutory hearing on that day and was not in a position to do so the following Wednesday or Friday or "for some little time to come".
The respondent indicated that it wanted an urgent final hearing of the matter.
The matter was adjourned to 6 December 2007 on the basis that the applicant would apply to have the matter heard on that day.
The matter was then allocated to my docket.
4 On Thursday, 6 December 2007, the matter came before me.
The applicant sought to commence the hearing of its interlocutory application.
The respondent opposed this course of action on the basis that it was not ready to proceed and could not be ready to proceed until Monday, 10 December 2007, at the earliest.
The respondent again indicated its willingness to agree to an early final hearing.
I then fixed the hearing of the interlocutory application for the following day.
5 The interlocutory hearing commenced on 7 December 2007.
During the course of the hearing, the respondent offered to undertake to remove one of the contentious forms of advertising, namely the billboards, within a period of 5 days but only if the applicant desisted from seeking any further interlocutory relief.
The applicant did not accept that offer.
The proceedings did not finish on that day and were adjourned for further hearing to the next available Court date, namely 14 December 2007.
6 Shortly after the hearing for interlocutory injunctive relief resumed on 14 December 2007, I invited the parties to consider whether the interlocutory hearing might transform into a final hearing on the basis that I would make final orders that day disposing of all issues between the parties.
I suggested this course for several reasons.
First, I doubted, as I indicated to the parties, that further additional evidence would be necessary to enable the resolution of the issues on a final basis.
Secondly, I had formed the preliminary view that on the evidence presented to that point, the respondent was able to make claims about the comparative performance of its batteries of the type alluded to in the advertising and other promotional material.
However, I had also formed the preliminary view that the form of advertising and promotion actually used by the respondent to convey the comparative performance of its batteries was misleading and deceptive.
I communicated at least aspects of these views to the parties.
In the result, both the applicant and the respondent agreed to the transformation of the proceedings, with the applicant doing so on the basis that it accepted that the respondent could make a comparison between its batteries and one of the types of batteries made and sold by the applicant.
7 The batteries manufactured by the applicant are, relevantly, of three types.
They are Energizer e 2 Lithium, Energizer e 2 Advanced and Energizer Max.
Each is sold, relevantly, in two sizes, namely AA and AAA.
Of these batteries only the Energizer Max is an alkaline battery.
The respondent's battery is called Varta High Energy and is sold, relevantly, in the same two sizes, namely AA and AAA.
It is an alkaline battery.
The applicant ultimately accepted that the respondent could claim that both sizes of the Varta High Energy battery would last as long as the equivalently sized Energizer Max battery but alleged, correctly, that the same comparison could not be made in relation to the Energizer Lithium battery and the Energizer Advanced battery.
8 The evidence concerning the applicant's testing was to the following effect.
The test results were detailed in a table entitled "Comparative Performance Summary" that was reproduced at pages 1-2 of Confidential Exhibit TM-2, exhibited to the affidavit of Anthony Mazzola and at pages 1-2 of Confidential Exhibit GRC-2, exhibited to the affidavit of Graeme Randall Clench.
The testing was undertaken by reference to the applicable international standards (drawn from the International Electrotechnical Commission ("IEC") and the American National Standards Institute ("ANSI")) against which battery performance is traditionally assessed.
Different tests measure the length of time a battery lasts when used in connection with different electronic devices such as high drain devices (for example, portable mp3 or tape players and cameras) and low drain devices (such as radios).
The testing can take between 4 and 6 weeks.
9 The test results that were compiled in the "Comparative Performance Summary" compared the performance of different batteries in relation to the Varta High Energy battery.
In the "Comparative Performance Summary", Varta High Energy, the battery against which others were tested, was given a base figure of 100%.
The performance of other batteries that were tested in comparison to the Varta High Energy battery was expressed as a percentage of this base figure.
10 If a tested battery's performance was superior to that of the Varta High Energy battery (i.e.
it lasted longer than the Varta High Energy battery), that particular test battery was given a figure greater than 100%.
Conversely, if a tested battery's performance was inferior to that of the Varta High Energy battery (i.e.
it did not last as long the Varta High Energy battery) that particular test battery was given a figure less than 100%.
