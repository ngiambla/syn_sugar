 
1 By notice of motion dated 10 April 2008 the applicant moved the court for orders that orders I made on 3 April 2008 be set aside or stayed.
On 3 April 2008 I ordered that three notices of motion, filed by the applicant, be dismissed because he did not appear when the proceeding was called on for the hearing of those motions.
The three notices of motion sought leave to appeal from a judgment of Sundberg J made on 29 February 2008 and an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal, a stay of his Honour's order that the applicant provide security for costs of an appeal from a decision of a federal magistrate and a declaration that the applicant had provided security for costs in accordance with his Honour's orders by reason of the respondent being the part owner of land in which the applicant had an interest.
2 The precise terms of the orders of Sundberg J which were the subject of the notices of motion were as follows:
 
 
 "1 On or before 14 March 2008 the applicant provide security in the sum of $13,215 for the costs to be incurred by the respondent in the appeal, such security to be provided in a form acceptable to the District Registrar.
2 If such security is not provided as aforesaid, the appeal be forthwith dismissed.
3 The applicant pay the respondent's costs of the motion notice of which was filed on 27 July 2007.
" 
 

3 The three notices of motion were made returnable before Goldberg J as duty judge on 28 March 2008.
On that day the applicant appeared in person and applied for a seven day adjournment to allow time for him to instruct solicitors to act for him on the hearing of the motions.
4 The following submissions and exchanges occurred, Mr Maher told his Honour that he had, by letter to his Honour's associate, advised that he would be seeking and adjournment because he had "retained a legal firm of solicitors which I have named which have said they could take if I am able to get an adjournment of 7 days.
"
 

Later his Honour asked counsel for the respondent:
 "Why do you oppose the adjournment?
" 
Counsel responded:
 "First ground, your Honour, is that in my submission the applicant has had his material since about 14 March.
That is the date of the sworn affidavits to the extent that I can ascertain the dates of them from the jurats which appear to be crossed through and the four seems to be placed upon them.
Last week, on the 26th, in the Supreme Court Mr Maher sought and obtained an adjournment because he had retained solicitors in that matter.
" 
His Honour:
 "What is that matter?
" 
Counsel:
 "It is a different matter, but it is between the Commonwealth Bank and Mr Maher.
Mr Maher lodged some caveats over a property and accordingly the bank applied to remove those caveats.
" 
His Honour:
 "These are properties in respect, or a property in respect of which the bank held a mortgage security, I take it?
" 
Counsel:
 "Correct.
So that was Wednesday and then ..." 
His Honour:
 "So what happened on Wednesday, the matter came before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
" 
Counsel:
 "It did.
" 
His Honour:
 "And Mr Maher sought an adjournment?
" 
Counsel:
 "He did.
" 
His Honour:
 "Did you appear in that matter?
" 
Counsel:
 "I did.
" 
His Honour: 
 "And for what purpose did he seek the adjournment?
" 
Counsel:
 "Because he had recently engaged a solicitor from the firm Berrigan and Doube, solicitors.
Accordingly the adjournment was granted on that basis.
" 
His Honour: 
 "For how long?
" 
Counsel:
 "Until next Monday.
Accordingly, the history is, in my submission, that he engages solicitors at the last minute in order to delay.
In my submission, that is fairly apparent in this matter given the date that he swore his affidavits, given that the first that we are told about his intention to engage lawyers in this matter is yesterday and we are here today.
So in terms of the merits of the adjournment application, in my submission, it is unsatisfactory.
But then when one looks at what is sought in the motions, it is my submission, they are palpably without merit.
" 

 
5 After further exchanges between bench and bar table Mr Maher advised the court that:
 "Ultimately, I rang another firm and they couldn't assist me.
That was Cleal  White but they referred me through the Law Institute Journal to this particular firm which I rang and that was on the Wednesday and I finally spoke or sent the papers through to Mr Lionel --- I forget his second name now for a second --- but he's the partner and he rang me back yesterday and said, yes, look I'll endeavour to talk to the other side but I really think that you should try and adjourn it for yourself, I'm happy to do this in a week's time, it would take me that long to get around it.
" 
His Honour: 
 "Have you actually been to his office or have you just spoken to him over the phone?
" 
Mr Maher:
 "I've just spoken to him over the phone, your Honour.
" 
His Honour: 
 "Have you delivered the papers to him?
" 
Mr Maher:
 "He hasn't had all the papers, your Honour, no.
I've given him the notices.
..." 
His Honour: 
 "What papers did you deliver to him?
" 
Mr Maher:
 "The three notices of motion that are before your Honour today which he said were insufficient for him to go on and I've got the other file there and he said I was to bring in today depending on the outcome of this matter, this application.
" 
His Honour: 
 "So if I grant the adjournment what do you intend to do then?
" 
Mr Maher:
 "I'll deliver the file to that firm in Queen Street and they will go on the record and appear for me next week.
" 

 
6 His Honour then determined that he would grant the adjournment because it was preferable that Mr Maher should be represented at the hearing of his notices of motion and that a relatively short adjournment was involved.
His Honour concluded his observations with the following statement:
 "So speaking for myself if I am to hear it next Thursday, and that depends on availability of judges, I would be assisted if Mr Maher can get legal representation.
If he can't the matter will go on next Thursday.
" (Emphasis added) 

 
7 In the following week I was the duty judge.
No notice of appearance was filed by the firm of solicitors who the applicant had advised his Honour had agreed to act for him.
On 1 April 2008 and 3 April 2008 the applicant made contact with my chambers.
As I recorded at the hearing on that day 3 April:
 "this is an adjourned hearing of a return of three notices of motion that were listed before the court last Friday.
On that occasion the judge dealing with the matter was Goldberg J.
Mr Maher applied to Goldberg J for an adjournment so that he can instruct solicitors who would then appear for him.
He said he had already engaged those solicitors on the previous day.
Goldberg J was mindful of the advantage of having legal representation before the court when the notices of motion came on for hearing and adjourned the hearing of those notices until this morning.
Mr Maher has in the last 24 hours made a number [of] contacts with my chambers in which he has sought successively adjournments for seven days, an indefinite period and, most recently until 2.15 this afternoon.
On each occasion he has been advised that the matter was listed for hearing at 10.15 this morning and would be heard.
" 
8 The notice of motion presently under consideration was supported by an affidavit sworn by the applicant on 10 April 2008.
The substance of his evidence was that he had been engaged in litigation in the Supreme Court against the Commonwealth Bank on 31 March and 1 April 2008.
He had appeared in person before Smith J.
He had initially been represented by counsel but counsel withdrew and the applicant appeared for himself.
When attending the Supreme Court he had had to carry a bag which contained heavy folders of documents which he needed to assist him in dealing with the application.
He said that this caused him to feel pain and made it difficult for him to move even with the assistance of his crutches.
He further deposed that, on 31 March 2008 and 1 April 2008, he received telephone messages from the solicitors whom he had engaged on the previous Thursday, but because he was in court on those days, he was unable to return the calls until late in the afternoon on 1 April 2008.
When he did so he was informed by the solicitors that they could not represent him on 3 April 2008 in this Court as they needed to obtain further detailed instructions from him in person and that this would not be possible between then and the morning of 3 April 2008.
9 Mr Maher then sent a facsimile to the associate of Goldberg J and to the solicitor for the respondent seeking an adjournment of the hearing on 3 April 2008.
He made the further contacts with the Court to which I had earlier adverted at 8.58 am at 10.01 am and at 10.03 am on 3 April 2008 and, on each occasion, was advised by my associate that, in the absence of consent by the respondent, there would be no adjournment and that the matter was to proceed at 10.15 am that morning.
10 Mr Maher deposes that he did not appear on 3 April because of physical ill health of which he says the Court and the respondent were on notice.
He said that the respondent was on notice by reason of the fact that its legal representatives were in the Supreme Court on 31 March and 1 April 2008 and had the opportunity to observe him.
He also deposed that during the relevant time he sought the assistance of a medical practitioner but was unable to obtain an appointment until 4 April 2008 and when he did obtain that appointment, he was examined and the practitioner issued a medical certificate certifying that he was unfit for work on 3 and 4 April 2008.
11 The respondent relied on two affidavits of Mr Grant Dewar, a solicitor employed by it.
The affidavits were affirmed on 2 April 2008 and 16 April 2008.
