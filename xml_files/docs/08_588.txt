The substantive proceeding is an application under s 5(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to review a decision made by the first respondent Minister to approve the construction and operation by Gunns of a bleached Kraft pulp mill at Bell Bay, Tasmania.
The Minister made the impugned decision under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) ("EPBC Act").
2 LFF is an association incorporated pursuant to the Associations Incorporation Act 1981 (Vic).
Its purposes include the promotion of the conservation and better management of Australia's native forests and the stimulation and encouragement of public interest in the value and importance of protecting native forests and related environmental issues.
3 Under s 487(3) of the EPBC Act , LFF has standing to bring this proceeding as a person aggrieved by the Minister's decision.
That is because in the two years immediately before the Minister's decision LFF has engaged in a series of activities in Australia "for protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment": see s 487(3)(b).
Further, the time of the Minister's decision its purposes included "protection or conservation of, or research into, the environment": see s 487(3)(c).
4 In support of its application for security for costs, Gunns refers, in an affidavit of its solicitor, to the meagre assets of LFF which stood at about $6,450 as at 30 June 2006 and to the considerable expenditure required by Gunns to defend the proceeding, running to over $100,000.
5 In a reply affidavit, a member of the committee of LFF says that as at 31 January 2008 LFF had assets of approximately $8,700 which it intends to use to pay for disbursements in the proceeding.
The affidavit also states that LFF is funded by voluntary contributions and that LFF could not provide security for costs in the sum of $103,445 as requested by Gunns.
If such an order was made, the proceeding could not continue.
From an affidavit filed this morning it appears that LFF's financial position has improved by a few thousand dollars as a result of fundraising.
6 Section 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) permits the Court to order that an applicant in a proceeding give security for the payment of costs that may be ordered against it.
If security is not given in accordance with any order made to provide it, the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed.
Order 28 rule 3 of the rules of Court provides:
 (1) When considering an application by a respondent for an order for security for costs under s 56 of the Act, the Court may take into account the following matters: ... (b) that an applicant is suing, not for the applicant's own benefit, but for the benefit of some other person and the Court has reason to believe that the applicant will be unable to pay the costs of the respondent if ordered to do so; ... 
7 LFF concedes that it is impecunious but contends that no order for security for costs should be made against it.
