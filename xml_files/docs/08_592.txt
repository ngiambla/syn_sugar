1 Smurfit Stone Container Corporation seeks an order under O 9 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules discharging an order made on 7 November 2007 giving leave to Armacel Pty Limited to serve originating process on Smurfit in the United States.
2 Alternatively, Smurfit seeks a stay of this proceeding on the ground that the Federal Court is a clearly inappropriate forum in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 and Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571.
3 The proceeding arises out of a Technology Licence Agreement dated 28 October 2004 between Armacel and Smurfit and the negotiations which preceded the Agreement.
Armacel is an Australian company which owns the intellectual property rights to an industrial process that uses pressure impact forging to produce strong plastic film-coated products that are used in a range of industries.
Armacel licensed Smurfit to use the technology in the United States under the terms of the Agreement.
4 By its Application and Statement of Claim filed on 7 November 2007 Armacel claims damages under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and damages for breach of contract.
Armacel's claim under the Trade Practices Act alleges that Smurfit made a number of pre-contractual representations on which Armacel relied in entering into the Agreement.
The claim for breach of contract alleges that Smurfit breached the terms of the Agreement inter alia by disconnecting the Armacel equipment which was the subject of the Agreement and failing to use its best endeavours to exploit the technology.
5 However, on 5 October 2007, one month before Armacel filed its Application in this Court, Smurfit commenced proceedings in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
In those proceedings Smurfit seeks negative declaratory relief that it has no remaining obligations under the Agreement, other than the payment of certain monthly instalments and the return of Armacel's equipment.
6 On 27 December 2007 the US District Court dismissed a motion brought by Armacel for the dismissal of the proceeding on the ground of want of jurisdiction.
In doing so, the District Court rejected Armacel's contention that cl 21.3.1 of the Agreement is an exclusive jurisdiction clause under which Smurfit agreed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of New South Wales.
Instead, the District Court held that the clause provided for the selection of New South Wales as a non-exclusive forum.
7 The question of whether cl 21.3.1 is an exclusive jurisdiction clause, and the effect of the decision of the District Court that New South Wales is a non-exclusive forum, are at the heart of the issues that arise on Smurfit's motion.
Those two questions, and the current state of the proceeding in the US District Court, are also central to a motion brought by Armacel for an anti-suit injunction to restrain Smurfit from continuing with the proceeding in the US District Court.
The Issues 
 
8 Five essential issues arise on the Notices of Motion.
The first issue is whether Armacel has made out a prima facie case with respect with respect to its trade practices claims, as required by O 8 r 3(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules .
9 Smurfit relies upon a analysis of the claims set out in a number of the paragraphs of the Statement of Claim to make good its contention that no prima facie case has been demonstrated.
10 The effect of Smurfit's submission on the first issue is that, no prima facie case having been established under the Trade Practices Act , the claim for breach of contract does not fall within the accrued jurisdiction of the Court under the principles stated in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 608-609.
11 The second issue is whether the decision of the US District Court was final and conclusive and "on the merits", so as to give rise to an issue estoppel precluding Armacel from contending that cl 21.3.1 is an exclusive jurisdiction clause.
12 The third issue is the proper construction of cl 21.3.1.
That is to say, the question is whether that clause provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of New South Wales.
Also falling within this issue is the subsidiary question of whether a submission to the jurisdiction of New South Wales is a submission to the jurisdiction of the New South Wales Registry of the Federal Court.
Senior Counsel for Smurfit submits that it is not.
This issue only arises if Armacel is not bound by an issue estoppel .

 
13 The fourth issue, which only arises if I am satisfied that the jurisdiction of New South Wales is non-exclusive and that Armacel is not bound by an issue estoppel, is whether this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum, ie.
whether this proceeding is vexatious or oppressive in the strict sense: Voth at 564-565; Henry v Henry at 587, 591-592.
14 This issue includes the question of whether the Trade Practices Act claim is amenable to the jurisdiction of the US District Court, the stage which the proceedings have reached, and the nature of the proceedings.
15 Smurfit submits that, in substance, the proceedings raise a live dispute about a contract made in the United States, to be performed wholly within the United States so that the true subject matter of the Agreement is American in nature.
16 Smurfit also submits that, seen in this light, and having regard to the modern approach to the use of negative declarations is transnational litigation, the Court should find that the US District Court proceeding is consistent with the purpose of ensuring that the aims of justice are achieved: Messier Dowty Ltd v Sabena SA [2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 428 at [34]ff.
17 The fifth issue is, whether in the event that Smurfit is unsuccessful on its motion, I ought to grant Armacel's motion for an anti-suit injunction.
The principal question which arises under this issue is the stage that the US District Court proceeding has reached and whether to restrain it:
 
 ...would be not only invidious but the reverse of comity: Aggeliki Charis Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA ("the Angelic Grace") [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep 87 at 95.


 The Negotiations 
 
18 In early 2004 a representative of Smurfit made contact with Armacel in an email requesting information about Armacel's technology.
At that time, Mr Frank Matich of Armacel was in discussion with a number of other American companies that were interested in licensing the technology.
19 The background to Armacel's discussions with potential American licensees appears to be that in late 2003 it won an award from an American association as technology innovator of the year in the United States.
Details were published in various magazines and journals, as a result of which Armacel received enquiries from countries in North and South America for the exploitation of the technology.
20 The negotiations between Armacel and Smurfit took place over a number of months between March 2004 and October 2004 All the face-to-face meetings between the parties were held in the United States but there were communications between the parties over the telephone and by way of email between Australia and the USA.
21 The Statement of Claim alleges that representatives of Smurfit made four misrepresentations in the pre-contractual meetings.
I will refer to the alleged misrepresentations later.
Evidence of the conversations which are said to have taken place and of the emails are to be found, principally, in the affidavit of Mr F Matich sworn 15 February 2008.
The Agreement 
 
22 The Agreement was signed on or about 28 October 2004 by Armacel, and, several weeks later, by Smurfit.
It would appear that the Agreement was signed by Smurfit in the United States.
23 Clause 2 of the Agreement provided that Armacel granted to Smurfit a non-exclusive licence to use Armacel's Technology, as defined in the Agreement, exclusively with certain Licensed Equipment, consisting of an Armacel machine to be used for the manufacture of the licensed products.
The Licensed Equipment was to be located at Smurfit's facility at Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania.
24 The term of the Agreement was for a period of five years: cl 2.4.
The consideration consisted of the payment of a Licence Fee and a Royalty.
The Licence Fee was an amount of $US250,000 on signing the Agreement and $US5,500 per month for the 60 month term of the Agreement.
25 The Royalty was 5% of the wholesale value of the approved and/or endorsed products manufactured by Smurfit.
There was no minimum royalty payable under the Agreement: cll 3 and 4.
26 Clause 7.8 provided that Smurfit would ensure that the equipment was electronically linked to Armacel at all times.
Denial of remote access to the equipment constituted a breach which entitled Armacel to terminate the Agreement: cl 7.9.
Upon termination, Smurfit was bound to return the equipment to Armacel: cl 7.14.
27 Clause 10 provided that Smurfit, at its own expense, was required to use reasonable effort to commercialise and exploit the technology and to manufacture, have manufactured, use, market and sell the products.
28 Clause 21.1 provided that the Agreement embodied all the terms binding between the parties and that it replaced all previous representations not embodied in the Agreement.
29 Clause 21.3 contained the sub-heading "Applicable law".
The clause was in the following terms:
 
 21.3.1 This Agreement must be read and construed according to the laws of the State of New South Wales, Australia and the parties submit to the jurisdiction of that State.
If any dispute arises between the Licensor and the Licensee in connection with this Agreement or the Technology, the parties will attempt to mediate the dispute in Sydney, Australia.

 21.3.2 In the event that there is a conflict between the laws of the State of New South Wales, Australia and the jurisdiction in which the Equipment is located, then the parties agree that the laws of the State of New South Wales shall prevail.

 21.3.3 If the licensee is in breach of this Agreement, the Licensee must pay to the Licensor on demand the amount of any legal costs and expenses incurred by the Licensor for the enforcement of its rights under this Agreement and this provision shall prevail despite any order for costs made by any Court.

 

30 Clause 22 was headed "market opportunity".
It provided that Armacel would not establish a competitor facility in the same geographic location as the Jersey Shore Facility and that it would not provide its technology to other nominated companies.
31 Clause 22.2 went on to provide that this "market opportunity" was granted to provide adequate time for Armacel and Smurfit to enter into and conclude discussions in relation to the expansion of the Armacel technology throughout the Smurfit Stone group in North America.
The Statement of Claim 
 
32 The representations on which Armacel is said to have relied in entering into the Agreement are pleaded in [12], [15], [18] and [21] of the Statement of Claim.
I will briefly describe the pleaded representations but I do not propose to set out the particulars given in the Statement of Claim.
33 The first representation is called the Expansion Representation.
It is that Smurfit represented that if provided with a licence for the technology and an Armacel Integrator Series 16B machine, Smurfit:
 
 ...would expand its use of the Technology beyond one machine and beyond one site and enter into additional licences for the Technology.

 

34 The second representation is called the Exploitation Representation.
It is that if provided with a licence and a machine, Smurfit would market and make use of the technology and use the machine to exploit the technology.
35 The third representation is called the Relocation Representation.
