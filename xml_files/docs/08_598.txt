 
1 This is an application for declaratory and prerogative relief by Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd (Hamersley) against the National Competition Council (the NCC), an independent statutory authority established pursuant to s 29A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA).
The NCC exists primarily to assess progress made by State and Territory Governments in opening up to competition their agencies undertaking business activities.
It also provides advice and recommendations to the designated Minister, usually the Federal Treasurer, regarding the declaration of services under the essential facilities provisions of Pt IIIA of the TPA.
2 Hamersley, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto Limited, operates various mines in the Pilbara region in Western Australia.
It owns and operates a rail track service used to transport iron ore for export.
One of its competitors, the Pilbara Infrastructure Pty Ltd (TPI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, seeks access to that rail track service.
3 On 16 November 2007 TPI made an application to the NCC under s 44F(1) of the TPA requesting it to recommend to the designated Minister "that a particular service be declared".
The application identified Hamersley as the provider of the service and owner of the facility to which the application related.
4 Hamersley claims that, by reason of certain orders made by Kenny J in Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council [1999] FCA 867 ; (1999) 164 ALR 203) ( First Hamersley Iron ), the NCC should be prevented from considering or otherwise dealing with TPI's application.
5 In First Hamersley Iron , a similar application was made by Robe River Mining Co Pty Ltd and a group of associated joint venturers (hereafter described for convenience as Robe River).
Kenny J held that the NCC did not have power to recommend declaration of Hamersley's rail track under Pt IIIA of the TPA because it was not a "service" within s 44B.
That was because the rail track involved "the use of a production process" and therefore fell within the exclusion to the definition of "service" in that section.
6 TPI's application to the NCC, which lies behind this proceeding, involves the same rail track as that featured in First Hamersley Iron, though it extends beyond it.
Hamersley claims that the NCC remains permanently bound by her Honour's orders in First Hamersley Iron , and therefore has no power to consider TPI's application or recommend declaration of the service.
That is so despite the fact that TPI was not a party to the earlier proceeding.
7 Hamersley invokes the doctrine of res judicata as the central plank of its case.
It also relies upon what it says were undertakings given to the Court by the NCC in First Hamersley Iron , which it submits prevent the NCC from entertaining TPI's application.
THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEME 
 
8 Part IIIA of the TPA contains a statutory regime for regulated access to what may be described as "essential facilities".
Introduced in 1995, this regime allows the designated Minister, usually the Federal Treasurer, to "declare" a particular "service" pursuant to s 44H.
The Minister cannot proceed without a recommendation from the NCC.
This means that all declarations must be filtered through the NCC.
9 A declaration of a service overrides what would otherwise be the exclusive rights of the owner of a "monopoly" facility to determine the terms and conditions upon which that owner will supply its services to others.
In essence, the focus is upon facilities of national significance, which it would be uneconomic to duplicate and which supply a service, access to which would promote competition, efficiency and the public interest.
10 The first stage of this process is to determine whether the facility is essential.
Section 44F(1) provides that the designated Minister, or any other person, may apply to the NCC in writing, asking it to recommend that a particular service be declared.
Section 44F(2) states that after receiving the application, the NCC must inform the provider of the service of its receipt, and subsequently recommend to the designated Minister that the service either be declared or that it not be declared.
Section 44F(4) provides that in deciding what recommendation to make, the NCC must consider whether it would be economical for anyone to develop another facility that could provide part of the service.
11 Section 44B defines "service" for the purposes of Pt IIIA.
Relevantly, it states that "service" means a service provided by means of a facility and includes "the use of an infrastructure facility such as a road or railway line".
However, the section provides that the term "service" does not include "the use of a production process" except to the extent that it is an "integral but subsidiary part of the service".
12 The NCC cannot recommend and the relevant Minister cannot declare a service to be open to access by a third party unless they are satisfied of all of the matters set out in s 44G(2).
That section provides: 
 

 
 "The Council cannot recommend that a service be declared unless it is satisfied of all of the following matters: 
 
 (a) that access (or increased access) to the service would promote a material increase in competition in at least one market (whether or not in Australia), other than the market for the service; 
 
 (b) that it would be uneconomical for anyone to develop another facility to provide the service; 
 
 (c) that the facility is of national significance, having regard to: 
 
 (i) the size of the facility; or 
 (ii) the importance of the facility to constitutional trade or commerce; or 
 (iii) the importance of the facility to the national economy; 
 
 (d) that access to the service can be provided without undue risk to human health or safety; 
 
 (e) that access to the service is not already the subject of an effective access regime; 
 
 (f) that access (or increased access) to the service would not be contrary to the public interest.
" 

13 A Ministerial decision to declare a service is capable of review on application by the provider of the service.
Reviews are undertaken by the Australian Competition Tribunal.
Likewise, when a Minister rejects a recommendation for a declaration, the unsuccessful applicant may apply to the Australian Competition Tribunal to have that decision reviewed.
14 In general terms, a service cannot be declared unless to do so would promote competition.
Competition will be promoted if access to the relevant service creates the conditions for the improvement of competition.
15 The provisions of Pt IIIA are complex and have given rise to difficulty.
For example, judges of this Court have differed as to the meaning of the term "the use of a production process" in s 44B.
Recently, in BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd v National Competition Council (2007) 162 FCR 234 , a Full Court, by majority, disapproved Kenny J's reasoning in First Hamersley Iron.
In March this year, the High Court granted special leave to appeal from that decision of the Full Court.
16 It is well established that the doctrine of res judicata will apply whether or not the decision which is said to give rise to that form of estoppel has itself been overruled.
It makes no difference whether the initial judgment was wrong.
It follows that I need not concern myself with whether First Hamersley Iron represents good law.
The only question is whether it operates in the way for which Hamersley contends.
FIRST HAMERSLEY IRON 
 
17 In considering whether First Hamersley Iron operates to prevent the NCC from dealing with the TPI application , it is of course necessary to pay close attention to the issues determined in that case.
18 The facts may be briefly stated.
In September 1998 Robe River applied to the NCC under s 44F(1) to recommend that the designated Minister declare the Hamersley rail track to be a "service".
The application identified Hamersley as the provider of the service and the owner of the facility to which it related.
19 The Robe River application went on to state as follows: 
 
 
 "3.2 The service to which [Robe] seeks access is the bulk iron ore rail track transportation service provided by the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility, as defined in part 4 of this application ( Rail Track Service ).
This should be distinguished from any rail haulage service which may be available in relation to this facility.

 
 
 
 
 
 3.3 The Rail Track Service is required for use by both [Robe] trains and by [Robe] hi-rails only over that section of the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility described in part 4 of this application.

 
 
 
 
 
 The Rail Track Service comprises the use of an infrastructure facility, being the Hamersley Rail Infrastructure Facility mainline, yard track and maintenance support road, including the in-track fault detection and monitoring systems, and the use of a communications service being the train control systems, inclusive of two-way radio.

 
 
 
 
 
 3.4 The access sought by [Robe] is the use of the Rail Track Service by [Robe] trains laden with iron ore from [Robe's] West Angelas minesite, travelling from the minesite to [Robe's] Port Walcott at Cape Lambert, and by empty [Robe] trains on a return journey to the minesite.

 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 3.6 [Robe] is not seeking the service provided by the [Hamersley] locomotives, rolling stock or hi-rails.
[Robe] will provide its own locomotives, rolling stock, hi-rails and all necessary operational personnel.
