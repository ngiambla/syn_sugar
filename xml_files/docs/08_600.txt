 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This is an appeal from orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 11 July 2007 in SZHVM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1200.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellant is a citizen of Indonesia and arrived in Australia on 23 November 2004.
On 22 December 2004, the appellant lodged an application for a protection (class XA) visa.
3 The appellant claimed that she had witnessed electoral fraud during the Indonesian presidential election of 2004.
She reported what she saw to the Komiti Pemilihan Umum ('the KPU'), the Indonesian National Elections Commission, in her local area.
She claimed that the following day she was threatened with death if she 'did not keep quiet'.
Days after that she was assaulted by young men.
She suspected that her report to the KPU had leaked.
She hid at a friend's place but was then told to leave the house because of the fears her friend held as a result of offering a safe haven to the appellant.
The appellant departed from Indonesia.
She feared that she would suffer serious harm if she returned to Indonesia and that the authorities would not protect her.
