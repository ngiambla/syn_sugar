1 The applicant Mr Mark Gordon applied for a position as a GST Compliance Officer, APS 4 level, in the Launceston office of the Australian Taxation Office.
The ATO made him an offer of employment, subject to, amongst other things, a condition that should he be found unfit for employment the offer would be withdrawn or his employment terminated.
He commenced work but shortly afterwards the ATO withdrew the offer.
His medical assessment on behalf of the ATO had revealed a blood pressure reading of 200/110.
On reassessment some three weeks later the reading was 200/125.
2 Mr Gordon claims that he has been subject to discrimination in employment contrary to s 15(2)(c) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth), which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee's disability by dismissing the employee.
3 There was disputed evidence as to the true level of Mr Gordon's hypertension, particularly in light of the fact that he appears to have been subject to a well known medical condition known as "white coat syndrome".
This refers to the anxiety people often have when undergoing medical tests which results in a higher blood pressure reading than would otherwise be the case.
However, while hypertension is undoubtedly a "disability" as defined in s 4 of the Act ("(e) the malfunction... of a part of the person's body") the term includes a disability that "(k) is imputed to a person".
4 For the purpose of the Act, according to s 5(1) , discrimination occurs 
 if, because of the aggrieved person's disability, the discriminator treats or proposes to treat the aggrieved person less favourably than, in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person without the disability.
The disability imputed to Mr Gordon was that of a person with a serious level of hypertension.
5 Section 15(2)(c) relevantly provides:
 It is unlawful for an employer... to discriminate against an employee on the ground of the employee's disability... ... (c) by dismissing the employee... 
6 The respondent relies on the defence provided by s 15(4) of the Act which provides: 
 Neither paragraph (1)(b) nor (2)(c) renders unlawful discrimination by an employer against a person on the ground of the person's disability, if taking into account the person's past training, qualifications and experience relevant to the particular employment and, if the person is already employed by the employer, the person's performance as an employee, and all other relevant factors that it is reasonable to take into account, the person because of his or her disability: 
 
 (a) would be unable to carry out the inherent requirements of the particular employment; or
 (b) would, in order to carry out those requirements, require services or facilities that are not required by persons without the disability and the provision of which would impose an unjustifiable hardship on the employer.

 

7 The respondent says that one of the inherent requirements of this particular employment was extensive driving and to carry out those requirements Mr Gordon would require services or facilities which would impose an unjustifiable hardship on it.
The job had other physical demands, to which reference will be made, but driving was the critical requirement.
8 In the s 15(4) context the question arises whether it is the actual or imputed condition of Mr Gordon at the time of dismissal that is relevant.
Mr Gordon's career 
 
9 At the time of the alleged discrimination in May 2003 Mr Gordon was a single man aged 39.
10 He held the degrees of Bachelor of Economics (Hons) (University of Tasmania 1993) and Master of Business Administration (Bond University 1991).
He had qualified as a Certified Practising Accountant in 1997.
He had two outstanding units to complete towards the Graduate Diploma in Applied Finance and Investment (Securities Institute).
11 From 1985 to 1995 he worked for the Department of Veterans' Affairs in various clerical positions with the ranking of ASO 2 and later ASO 3.
12 From May 1995 to February 1996 he was with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission at ASO 5 level.
His duties included financial and prudential analysis and auditing superannuation funds.
13 From February 1996 to December 2001 he was employed by the ATO, initially at ASO 2 and later ASO 4.
Towards the end of this period he worked in the Interpretation and Compliance Section completing audit investigations, examining work related expenses and issuing Private Binding Rulings.
14 From July 2001 until April 2003 he conducted a business as a private tax agent from his home in Hobart.
Offer of employment 
 
15 On 22 March 2003 the ATO advised Mr Gordon by email that his application to work as a GST Field Officer at APS 4 level in Launceston had been successful.
This was confirmed in a letter headed "Offer of Ongoing Employment" dated 10 April.
16 The Offer was stated to be subject to the conditions set out in the letter.
One of these was:
 All new ongoing employees are required to undergo a medical examination to satisfy the ATO of their fitness to undertake the duties for which they have been selected.
You would have already attended a medical assessment prior to commencing duty.
Should you be found unfit for employment, this employment offer may be withdrawn or your employment terminated.
17 Another condition stated there would be a probation period of four months.
During this period the employee would receive training.
If the employee did not make satisfactory progress during the probation period, employment would be terminated.
18 The Offer enclosed a "Medical Evaluation" issued by Health Services Australia.
This document explained that with the introduction of the GST the new position of "GST Field Officer" had been created within the ATO.
Relevantly for present purposes it included the following:
 Does the doctor decide whether I get the job or not?
No.
The doctor will complete the form providing to Australian Taxation Office all the medical information about you that is relevant to your ability to do the job.
While the doctor will certainly provide medical recommendations regarding your fitness to do the work, the decision on your employment remains with Australian Taxation Office.
... Medical Adviser Guidance Notes ...
In reality very few medical conditions are an absolute contra-indication to employment.
However, there are certain GST Field Officer tasks such as driving in which conditions pre-disposing to sudden loss of consciousness, poor vision or hearing could pose a health risk; ...
