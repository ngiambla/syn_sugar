 
1 The Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia ("the applicant") alleges that Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd ("the respondent") and Mr Brian Morrison, the sole director, company secretary and sole shareholder of the respondent, are guilty of contempt of Court by reason of their failure to comply with paragraph 1 of orders I made on 28 September 2007.
BACKGROUND TO THE ORDERS OF 28 SEPTEMBER 2007 
 
2 On 12 September 2006 Ms Elizabeth MacPherson, the President of the Victorian Branch of the applicant, attended the respondent's premises and inspected the respondent's work records.
During the inspection Ms MacPherson completed a pro forma document entitled "Clothing Trades Award 1999 Part 9 (Contractors and Outworkers) --- Inspection Sheet".
She wrote on the inspection sheet: "Told to Supply A Sample of Invoices to each maker from 2005 --- current (1 peR (sic) mth) .... Give (sic) until end of business thursday (sic) to provide this information as it was not available  they were not willing to provide the information at the time of inspection.
" By letter dated 15 September 2006, signed by Mr Mike Hayes, on behalf of the respondent, Ms MacPherson received " [a] sample of invoices from [the respondent's] makers who make Morrison designed garments..." (Emphasis added).
3 On 2 November 2006 the applicant filed a statement of claim in which it was alleged that the respondent had "given work out" within the meaning of the Clothing Trades Award 1999 but had failed to comply with certain provisions of that Award which related to outworkers, including the obligation to keep work records ("the principal proceeding").
4 The respondent's participation in the principal proceeding has been intermittent at best.
No appearance has been filed by the respondent and no defence has been filed.
On occasion, the respondent has been represented by Mr Morrison.
However, on numerous occasions the respondent has failed to appear at all.
The respondent failed to appear at directions hearings held on 15 June 2007, 20 July 2007 and 28 September 2007 and two Court-ordered mediations scheduled for 7 March 2007 and 29 March 2007.
A mediation was eventually held on 29 May 2007 but the matter did not settle.
5 On 20 July 2007 I ordered the applicant to provide the respondent with a request for categories of discoverable documents and the respondent to "give discovery of the documents requested by the Applicant by serving a list of documents to be required to be disclosed and an affidavit verifying the list of documents on or before 24 August 2007.
"
 
 6 On 9 August 2007 Mr Morrison was personally served, and the respondent was served, with a copy of those orders and the applicant's request for categories of documents.
The period specified in the request was 1 January 2005 to 12 September 2006, the date on which Ms MacPherson attended the respondent's premises.
7 The matter was next listed for directions on 28 September 2007.
The respondent did not appear and had not complied with my orders of 20 July 2007.
On 28 September 2007, I made the following orders: 
 "1.
Mr Brian Morrison, Director of the Respondent, give discovery of the documents requested by the Applicant (in its Request for Categories of Documents to be Discovered dated 9 August 2007) by serving a list of documents required to be disclosed and an affidavit verifying the list of documents on or before 19 October 2007.
2.
That inspection of the discovered documents occur on or before 9 November 2007.
..." The orders bore the following notice: "TAKE NOTICE THAT: Pursuant to the Federal Court Rules, you are notified that you are liable to IMPRISONMENT and/or SEQUESTRATION OF PROPERTY if you refuse or neglect to comply with 
 
 - Order 1 of this Order on or before 
 
 19 October 2007, or 
 
 - Order 2 of this Order on or before 
 
 9 November 2007.
See Order 37 Rule 2(3) of the Federal Court Rules.
" 
8 A copy of the orders I made on 28 September 2007 was served on the respondent on 3 October 2007 and was personally served on Mr Morrison on 4 October 2007.
STATEMENT OF CHARGE 
 
9 By notice of motion and statement of charge filed on 22 November 2007, the applicant alleges that Mr Brian Morrison and the respondent are guilty of contempt of Court by reason of their breach of paragraph 1 of the orders I made on 28 September 2007 ("the Order"), because of their failure to give discovery on or before 19 October 2007 or at all.
THE CONTEMPT HEARING --- PROCEDURES AND ADJOURNMENTS 
 
10 The applicant's notice of motion was listed before me on 30 November 2007.
Mr Morrison appeared on behalf of the respondent and on his own behalf.
As at 30 November 2007, neither Mr Morrison nor anyone else on behalf of the respondent had served a list of documents (or any supporting affidavit) on the applicant, as required by the Order.
11 I asked Mr Morrison whether he was prepared to comply with the Order and explained that this required him to make a bona fide effort to locate all relevant documents and to make them available for inspection by the applicant.
Mr Morrison confirmed that he was and told the Court that he would do so to the best of his ability.
I adjourned the motion to 14 December 2007 to give both Mr Morrison and the respondent a further opportunity to comply with the Order.
I advised Mr Morrison that, if he had not complied with the Court's order by that date, I would give directions to bring on a trial for contempt of Court.
Mr Morrison confirmed that he understood the proposed course of action.
12 On 14 December 2007 Mr Morrison appeared on behalf of the respondent and on his own behalf.
Despite the Court's indulgence on 30 November 2007, no list of documents (or supporting affidavit) had since been filed by the respondent.
During the hearing, Mr Morrison indicated that he understood that he was in contempt of Court: "I was in contempt, your Honour ...which I deemed to be serious .... and the last thing I wanted is to defy you or the court or not to provide what, if it was able to be provided, material that has been sought.
" He stated that he had been "negligent" in not providing an affidavit, but explained he had not done so because the affidavit "would have been almost a blank piece of paper with [his] name on it saying that [he had] searched.
" 
 
13 I explained to Mr Morrison that the affidavit would require some considerable detail: when he started searching; where he searched, if he had searched at more than one premises, when he went to each of the premises, what he did there, how long he was there, what he searched for and what he found; how much time he devoted to the task; what enquiries he had made of other persons, for example Mr Hayes, who may have knowledge of whether the documentation requested by the applicant exists; and whether those persons were in possession of any documents.
Mr Morrison stated that, as there had been hours of searching, there would probably be "hours of recording material, where [he had] searched, what [he] was looking for.
" 
 
14 Towards the end of the hearing I reiterated that compliance with the Order required Mr Morrison to do more than look for documents and hand them to the applicant's solicitor.
I explained that it required Mr Morrison to conduct a renewed search and provide an affidavit explaining what he had done, what he had found, whose assistance he had sought, and what assistance he received.
Mr Morrison said that he understood what he was required to do and that he would do it.
15 The orders I made on 14 December 2007 specifically required Mr Morrison to set out in an affidavit the details of any enquiries he had made to comply with the Order: 
 "1.
On or before 6 February 2008, Mr Brian Morrison file and serve an affidavit deposing to: (c) The dates and times on which and places where he has undertaken searches; and (d) The details of any enquiries made by him in order to comply with paragraph 1 of the orders made herein on 28 September 2007.
" 
 ...."
 
The notice of motion and the statement of charge were adjourned to 8 February 2008.
16 During the course of the hearing on 14 December 2007, Mr Morrison requested that the applicant provide him with a copy of the sample invoices Mr Hayes had sent to Ms MacPherson on 15 September 2006 (see paragraph [2] above) which he suggested would assist him to make further enquiries.
On 19 December 2007 the applicant's solicitor sent Mr Morrison copies of the sample invoices.
17 On 25 January 2008, Mr Morrison swore an affidavit in which he deposed: 
 "1.
I, Brian Joseph Morrison, Director of Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd, the Respondent to this proceeding, provide to you in this affidavit, all material I can locate requested by the Applicant Textile Clothing  Footwear Union of Australia.
2.
I advise the two previous Production Managers of Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd have left the employment of this company.
Their records are not to be found other that (sic) what is provided by way of my Affidavit.
3.
I have checked files, searched for records at length in the office occupied by the previous Production Managers, [and] no additional information is available other than what I am supplying.
4.
I inform you that the two companies listed have both ceased trading: N  D Fashions
9 Alex Avenue 
Morrabbin (sic) 3189 Newtro Pty Ltd
64 Smith Street
Kensignton (sic) 3031 5.
These companies ceased trading sometime ago which partially explains why records are not to be found.
6.
I advised that the following companies have only ever supplied fully machine knitted finished garments from in-house knitting machines: Hysport International Pty Ltd 
62 Hartnett Drive 
Seaford 3198 A  B Knitwear Pty Ltd 
11 Thomas Street
Brunswick 3056 7.
I attach herewith and mark with the letters "BJM-1" a copy of all the material I have located.
" 
Exhibit "BM-1" comprised only the sample invoices sent to Mr Morrison on 19 December 2007.
18 This is the only affidavit that has been filed by Mr Morrison in this proceeding.
19 The notice of motion and statement of charge came on before me on 8 February 2008.
Mr Morrison did not appear; nor did anyone appear on behalf of the respondent.
I ordered the parties to file and serve any affidavits on which they intended to rely at the contempt hearing and adjourned the hearing to 15 April 2008.
At the request of the applicant, the hearing was later fixed for 30 April 2008.
20 The evidence relied on by the applicant was contained in a series of affidavits (together with the exhibits referred to in those affidavits).
