 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 GenRx Pty Limited ('GenRx'), which has since changed its name to Apotex Pty Ltd, has applied to the Court for relief against Les Laboratoires Servier and Servier Laboratories (Australia) Pty Ltd ('Servier Australia') in relation to a claim that Servier Australia has breached ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') in the course of advertising and promoting one of its drugs, Coversyl.
Les Laboratoires Servier is a privately owned innovative pharmaceutical company in France.
Servier Australia is a wholly owned subsidiary of Les Laboratoires Servier.
I shall, unless the context requires otherwise, refer to both as Servier.
GenRx is a supplier of generic pharmaceutical products.
2 In order to understand the nature of GenRx's complaint in relation to the Act, it is useful to have some understanding of how pharmaceuticals are regulated in Australia.
THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PHARMACEUTICALS IN AUSTRALIA 
 "a"-flagging 
 
3 Before a new drug for therapeutic treatment may be lawfully marketed and supplied in Australia it must be submitted for evaluation and approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (the 'TGA'), approved by that body and registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (the 'ARTG').
The TGA evaluates the specific form of the drug to be supplied and its safety and efficacy for use in treating particular conditions or indications.
An ARTG registration for a drug will be for a specified form of the drug and in respect of particular patient conditions and indications.
This registration may be amended for additional conditions or indications after TGA approval.
4 An ARTG registered drug may also be considered for listing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (the 'PBS').
Once approved, a drug is listed on the PBS by its brand name, in respect of a specific dosage and at a specified price.
5 Where a particular drug is listed on the PBS by an originator company, a supplier of another brand of that drug may apply to have its brand listed on the PBS as a substitute.
In order to be substitutable, the applicant must demonstrate that the new brand has the same active ingredient as the listed brand and is bioequivalent within acceptable levels identified in a particular standard.
The existence of substitutable brands for a particular brand of drug is known as "a"-flagging and is indicated by the letter "a" immediately before the brand name of the drug in the PBS schedule.
A drug may be "a"-flagged as substitutable for a listed PBS drug with different "finished product" stability, meaning different shelf life or storage conditions.
Once a generic drug which contains the same active ingredient has been accepted as "a"-flagged, it has been determined that it is sufficiently bioequivalent to the originator medicine.
6 Section 103(2A) of the National Health Act 1953 (Cth) in combination with a document entitled "Brand Premium Policy" issued by the Department of Health and Ageing provide that a pharmacist may supply a generic alternative if:
 
(a) the generic alternative is "a"-flagged against the prescribed brand;
 
(b) the patient agrees to the substitution;
 
(c) the prescriber has not indicated on the prescription form that substitution is not to occur; and
 
(d) substitution is permitted in the relevant state or territory.
7 The decision to allow generic substitution if a named drug is "a"-flagged is in the unfettered discretion of the prescribing doctor.
There are no other detailed regulations or guidelines directing that discretion.
Once the doctor indicates that there is to be no substitution, a pharmacist must dispense the prescribed drug and may not substitute one that is "a"-flagged on the PBS.
If substitution is permitted and the pharmacist intends to substitute an "a"-flagged drug, the pharmacist has a duty to provide an appropriate explanation about the substitution to the patient.
Prescriptions and substitution for brand drugs 
 
8 A prescription is an instruction from the prescribing doctor to the dispensing pharmacist.
A prescription will identify the name of the patient and the name of the prescribing doctor.
It will specify the name of a prescription drug and the relevant dosage for that particular patient.
When a drug is prescribed by a doctor, the doctor may specify the brand name of a particular drug or may identify that drug by its non-proprietary name, which does not distinguish between particular brands.
If the doctor prescribes a drug by brand name, the doctor may choose, in his or her discretion, to tick a square box which appears on the standard prescription form.
If the doctor ticks this box, the pharmacist who dispenses the drug to the patient may not substitute any "a"-flagged products for the named brand.
If the doctor does not tick the box, the pharmacist may substitute an "a"-flagged product for the drug named if the patient consents.
9 A "brand premium" is the difference in price between the brand drug and the generic.
If the doctor writes a prescription naming a drug or more than one drug on a prescription and ticks the box, the pharmacist will not be able to dispense a generic form for any drug on the prescription.
This means that the patient pays a brand premium, if such a premium applies to that drug.
10 It is clearly in the originator company's commercial interest to persuade doctors to tick the box to prevent substitution of its brand drug.
COVERSYL 
 
11 Servier distributes Coversyl, which contains perindopril as its active ingredient.
Coversyl is primarily used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure and to reduce the risk of heart attack (myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest) in patients with established coronary artery disease.
Perindopril has the effect of lowering blood pressure by blocking the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme ('ACE') in the plasma and at the tissue level.
Coversyl is the leading ACE inhibitor in Australia.
Approximately 360,000 patients are currently being prescribed Coversyl.
12 Since 1992 perindopril has been sold in Australia by Servier under the brand name Coversyl as an erbumine salt ('perindopril erbumine').
That formulation was listed on the PBS.
GenRx distributes a generic form of the perindopril erbumine salt ('GenRx perindopril product').
GenRx's perindopril product formulation is included in the ARTG.
13 Before Servier's main patent for perindopril expired, Servier substituted an equivalent salt form ('perindopril arginine') for the highly successful perindopril erbumine salt ('the salt switch').
14 Coversyl was initially registered for the treatment of hypertension.
On 17 June 2005 Coversyl, in the perindopril erbumine form, was approved by the TGA for the indication of stable coronary artery disease and, on 16 January 2006, Coversyl in the perindopril arginine form was approved for the same indications.
15 The conditions for which Coversyl is prescribed are very common, in particular with elderly patients and patients with type 2 diabetes.
These patients are commonly prescribed a number of medications which include Coversyl, as part of a broad, long-term treatment regime.
16 In the case of hypertension, the treatment regime is almost always long-term and a patient will remain on Coversyl for a number of years or indefinitely.
Repeat prescriptions are therefore required.
A Coversyl treatment regime involves taking a pill daily.
Failure to follow the treatment regime will not normally cause the patient observable symptoms.
Patient compliance with a long-term treatment regime such as Coversyl can be important for successful treatment.
Factors which inhibit patient compliance with hypertension treatments may include patients being required to take a number of different medications for other conditions, patient forgetfulness and the asymptomatic nature of hypertension.
Professor McLachlan, a Professor of Pharmacy (Aged Care) at the University of Sydney, said that adherence to medication with long-term therapy can be difficult for patients of all ages and especially for the elderly.
The salt switch 
 
17 GenRx submits that, in implementing the salt switch, Servier attempted to outflank generic competitors who were proposing to sell perindopril erbumine, by delisting its own version of that salt.
GenRx says that there was no clinical rationale for the salt switch.
GenRx says that the motive for the salt switch was to protect Servier's market from other perindopril products and to make it difficult for impending generic manufacturers to sell competing products after the patent for perindopril erbumine expired.
Servier says that the original reason for the salt switch is not relevant and that it preceded the representations the subject of these proceedings.
However, while as GenRx concedes, Servier was entitled to take the action that it did to carry out the salt switch, Servier's commercial interests, rather than a clinical rationale, appear to be the reason.
In any event, any such attempt was unsuccessful because GenRx's perindopril erbumine product did become "a"-flagged as substitutable for both "old" Coversyl (perindopril erbumine) and "new" Coversyl (perindopril arginine).
In approximately August 2006, Servier commenced supplying new Coversyl.
From 1 October 2006, brand substitution was permitted for new Coversyl, subject to a doctor's endorsement on the prescription that this not occur.
18 A TGA listing will include a shelf life period for a registered drug as packaged, based on stability data supplied by the applicant for registration.
The TGA approved a three year shelf life for new Coversyl in the perindopril arginine form, whereas old Coversyl in the perindopril erbumine form had an approved shelf life of two years.
19 Servier began marketing perindopril arginine in Australia in approximately June 2006.
Servier asserts clinical equivalence of the two salt forms and stressed clinical equivalence in its advertising of new Coversyl.
Servier has also entered into an agreement with a generic manufacturer pursuant to which that manufacturer is licensed to sell a generic perindopril erbumine product.
In addition, Servier continues to market and sell Coversyl Plus, which is a combination of perindopril erbumine and indapamide (a diuretic).
20 New Coversyl requires a new dose amount to deliver the same amount of perindopril.
The dosages 2, 4 and 8 mg of perindopril erbumine are equivalent to the dosages 2.5, 5 and 10 mg of the perindopril arginine.
The active amount of perindopril in the equivalent dosages of old Coversyl and new Coversyl is the same.
The different dosages reflect the difference in weight between the erbumine and arginine salt forms.
The amount of perindopril taken by the patient remains the same, as does the number of times a tablet is taken per day.
The packaging and getup of new Coversyl is different from that of old Coversyl.
A new bottle replaced blister packs.
21 GenRx's perindopril erbumine product is sold in a blister pack and in the same dosages as old Coversyl.
CONFUSION 
 Confusion arising from the salt switch 
 
22 The changes to dosages and label strength of the tablets, appearance of the tablets and packaging caused significant confusion among patients who were taking old Coversyl and who then received new Coversyl after the salt switch.
23 One particular aspect of confusion related to the change in the dosage between old and new Coversyl.
This confusion was not only on the part of patients but also, for example, on the part of nursing staff.
The confusion was sufficient for the Department of Health and Ageing to raise the concern with Servier in May 2007.
24 The evidence of the pharmacists Mr Oliver, Mr Thomas and Ms Crisp is that pharmacists observed substantial consternation and confusion on the part of customers caused by the change, largely due to the apparent change in dosage.
Although doctors gave evidence that they counselled their patients on the apparently different dose and explanations were given by pharmacists, such as Ms Crisp and Mr Crothers, this reduced but did not obviate the general confusion that resulted from the introduction of new Coversyl.
25 As Mr Oliver, a retail pharmacist, described events, Servier sales representatives informed him that the reason for the change was the increased stability of new Coversyl.
Servier did not explain to him the reason for the change in packaging, which was the subject of some complaint by his customers.
It may be that the different packaging was to provide a distinction between the two products.
One specific cause of complaint was the difficulty of extracting single tablets from the new bottle.
26 Servier appreciated that the salt switch was likely to cause confusion and took steps to address it.
When Servier introduced new Coversyl it conducted a campaign to explain to doctors the biological equivalence of the two products in the context of the different dosages and packaging.
However, Servier drew a distinction between its new Coversyl product and old Coversyl.
The message was that they are not the same.
Servier initially heavily promoted the fact that its perindopril arginine was not substitutable for its perindopril erbumine and that a new prescription would need to be written by doctors.
Servier told doctors that the new formulation has improved stability, reflected in a longer shelf life and that old Coversyl would be removed from the PBS from 1 December 2006.
As a result, doctors were educated that the two forms of perindopril were not substitutable.
The promotion of new Coversyl to doctors, which preceded the advertisements the subject of these proceedings, referred to the new formulation, the reason for the change in dosage and contained the statement "Every script for Coversyl is a commitment to R  D in Australia".
27 In October 2006, Servier informed pharmacists that, from 1 December 2006, new Coversyl and old Coversyl would be "a"-flagged as substitutable and that pharmacists would have the ability to switch patients from the old formulation to the equivalent dose of the new formulation.
28 As a result of Servier's strategy of listing new Coversyl and delisting old Coversyl, a number of patients on perindopril erbumine were changed to perindopril arginine.
There was a need for doctors and pharmacists to assist patients to overcome the confusion caused by that change.
29 However, the confusion caused by the introduction of new Coversyl is not, directly, the subject of these proceedings.
It preceded the present campaign directed against substitution of new Coversyl by generic perindopril erbumine products but it provides the context for and background to the campaign.
The effect on patient confusion of the decision to dispense a generic drug 
 
30 Professor McLachlan expresses the view in a published paper that, when deciding whether to substitute a generic product for a branded product, it is necessary for both doctor and pharmacist to consider the potential for patient confusion and to avoid substitution, unless the patient or carer fully understands the difference between various brands of the same medicine.
This is particularly the case with elderly patients, with patients with cognitive impairment and with patients taking multiple medicines for serious chronic illness.
However, it should also be noted that confusion will not automatically occur with generic substitution.
Professor McLachlan notes that brand changes generally may not cause major confusion.
For instance, in a hospital setting or, as the medical practitioner Dr Jackson noted, in a nursing home, medicines are often administered by healthcare professionals and not by the patient themselves.
31 Risk of confusion can be reduced by prescription of the same brand, although brand change is not necessarily itself a cause of confusion, especially with counselling.
Patients are generally familiar with brand substitution, although constant change between brands can itself cause confusion.
Confusion can be reduced by using the chemical name of the drug but many if not most prescriptions are written using the brand name.
Some patients rely on the shape, colour and size of the tablet to assist them in recognising the drug.
Patient confusion as to brand equivalence can give rise to "double dosing".
In the case of perindopril, double dosing could result in serious medical consequences for a patient.
Patient confusion can also result in non-compliance.
Successful patient compliance is assisted if the patient taking a daily tablet does so as a matter of routine.
32 Any confusion on the part of patients for whom generic medicines are dispensed may be minimised or removed by an appropriate explanation by the doctor or pharmacist.
To use the expression of some of the witnesses, confusion can be "managed".
That may well explain why pharmacists feel able, within their professional obligations which include counselling, to dispense generic substitutes for brand drugs.
However, whether or not pharmacists or Professors of Pharmacy such as Professor McLachlan, are of the view that generic substitution necessarily causes confusion or that pharmacists can overcome any confusion, the advertisements the subject of these proceedings are directed to medical practitioners.
It is the doctor who makes the initial decision whether to permit substitution.
The pharmacist then decides, if permitted to do so, whether to substitute a generic product for a branded product.
At that stage the pharmacist, as explained by Professor McLachlan, considers the patient's understanding of the medicine and the risk of medication misadventure as well as the age of the patient, any cognitive impairment, whether the patient is taking multiple medicines and the consistency of brands for patients on long-term therapy.
While both doctors and pharmacists may play a part in "managing" the confusion if patients are given a generic form of a drug, that confusion would not necessarily arise if substitution were prevented.
33 In the case of generic substitution for new Coversyl, the additional factors were the salt switch and the characteristics of the class of patients for whom perindopril was prescribed.
All generic substitutions have the potential to cause confusion on the part of patients.
Doctors are or should be aware of this.
Doctors would also be aware that, apart from the counselling that they provide, pharmacists are well used to dispensing generic substitutes and counselling patients accordingly.
34 Servier says that patients liable to have been confused by the salt switch would be further confused by another change.
Servier says that further confusion would be reduced by keeping patients taking new Coversyl on that drug.
Servier not only accepts that there was confusion from the salt switch, it also relies on it and says that further confusion would be caused by permitting generic substitution by the old form of perindopril with its previous dosage and old packaging.
Servier says that the confusion caused by the introduction of new Coversyl had been corrected and that the relevant advertising campaign was to prevent further confusion arising from the "a"-flagging of perindopril erbumine products which could now be substituted.
Servier's actions on the "a"-flagging of new Coversyl 
 
35 When Servier appreciated that GenRx's perindopril erbumine products were to be "a"-flagged against new Coversyl, Servier undertook a campaign directed at doctors which informed doctors that the GenRx products would be available substitutes for Coversyl.
On 27 November 2006 Servier sent a letter to doctors stating that from 1 December 2006 generic perindopril erbumine products would be available substitutes for new Coversyl and encouraged the doctors to tick the no substitution box on prescription forms to avoid patient confusion.
36 At about the same time, presentations were made by Servier representatives to doctors by which Servier informed doctors that substitutes were available and exhorted them to consider ticking the box on their prescriptions to prevent that happening.
A slide used by Servier to train its representatives in the content of those presentations included the statement: ' PBS listed generic brands of perindopril 2, 4, 8 mg December 1 st 2006 ' followed by ' GenRx perindopril, Terry White Perindopril and Chemmart perindopril '.
The document was headed: ' Tick the box for New Coversyl... ' and a ticked box appeared next to the words "brand substitution not permitted".
The slide also referred to new Coversyl's improved stability and Servier's investment in Australia.
37 Servier also began an extensive advertising and marketing campaign.
Because of the "a"-flagging of generic products for new Coversyl, a doctor could continue to exercise his or her discretion to prescribe GenRx's perindopril erbumine product in substitution for Servier's perindopril arginine.
Servier's marketing campaign was directed to this discretion.
Servier distributed a stamp to some 3000 doctors for use on prescriptions and placed four advertisements in medical publications (together 'the advertisements').
The stamp and the advertisements are the subject of these proceedings.
38 Servier maintains that its marketing campaign has as an objective the therapeutic benefit of obtaining better patient compliance by avoiding confusion associated with substitution.
Servier's marketing evidence suggests that this was not the only object of the campaign, which was also directed to preventing generic substitution in Servier's interests.
Servier is entitled to conduct such a campaign as long as it does not contravene the Act.
THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS 
 
39 GenRx accepts that Servier is entitled to advertise Coversyl and to endeavour to persuade doctors to tick the box on the prescription form and thus prevent brand substitution of Coversyl as prescribed.
However, GenRx alleges that Servier has contravened ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Act in relation to the stamp and the advertisements.
40 Although Servier has given undertakings in relation to the stamp and two of the advertisements, GenRx seeks permanent injunctive relief, the recall of the stamp, corrective advertising and damages.
41 The parties directed the evidence and submissions to the issue of whether the representations in the stamp and the advertisements were misleading and deceptive under s 52 of the Act.
While the fourth further amended statement of claim ('the pleading') also alleges breaches of ss 53 and 55 of the Act, no submissions were directed to the separate issues that may arise in connection with breaches of those sections.
I shall consider the case as presented.
MFI-3 
 
42 GenRx presses, and Servier opposes, the tender of parts of a document, given the identifier MFI-3.
That document is a collection of reports from Servier's representatives of their communications with medical practitioners and pharmacists.
