Until very recently AOS traded as "Merringtons" and operated a large number of retail shops throughout Australia.
Unfortunately, Merringtons took a myopic approach to its obligations under industrial law.
AOS failed to pay Ms Eghnatios and several other of its employees their correct wages and entitlements over a period of about 15 months.
Ms Eghnatios complained to "Wageline" about the underpayments.
The Office of Workplace Services ("OWS"), through one of its inspectors, commenced a proceeding against AOS in respect of the underpayments.
AOS knew that Ms Eghnatios had complained to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations ("the Department").
At the relevant time, OWS was part of the Department.
AOS transferred Ms Eghnatios in her employment from a store reasonably proximate to her home to one which was a considerable distance from her home.
When she refused to be transferred, AOS suspended her.
The suspension remained on foot until her resignation.

Ms Byrne is an "eligible person" for the purposes of s 807(4)(a) of the Act and is entitled to bring the current proceeding.
3 The proceeding is one under s 807 of the Act for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty on AOS for contravention of s 792 of the Act .
In her amended application, Ms Byrne also seeks an order for the payment of compensation to Ms Eghnatios under s 807(1)(b) of the Act .
