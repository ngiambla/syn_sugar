Seawater will be desalinated and piped some 85 km to Melbourne.
2 On 31 December 2007 the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment referred the Project to the Federal Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the EPBC Act).
Under s 68 of that Act a person proposing to take an "action" which may have a significant impact on any of the matters of national environmental significance specified in Pt 3 of Ch 2 must "refer" the action to the Federal Minister.
The Minister then decides whether the action needs Federal approval because of its potential impact on those matters.
If so, the Minister will designate it under s 75(1) as a "controlled action".
At the same time the Minister identifies the specific provisions of Pt 3 which are applicable (the "controlling provisions").
The Minister must then decide under s 87 which of a number of approaches must be used for the assessment of the relevant impacts.
After that assessment is completed the Minister may approve the taking of the action (s 133).
3 The referral by the Victorian Department (the Referral) described the Project and its potential impacts but expressly excluded from the Referral certain works, referred to in the present case as "the Preliminary Works".
The Preliminary Works are preliminary investigation works which are to be undertaken to obtain information for the purpose of project design, location and environmental assessment.
Amongst other things, information obtained from such investigations will be essential for those tendering for the construction of the Project.
