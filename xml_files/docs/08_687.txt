 BACKGROUND 
 
1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 24 January 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") dated 15 May 2007 and handed down on 24 May 2007: see Narayan v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 64.
On 15 May 2007, the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse to grant a Partner (Temporary) (Class UK) visa or a Partner (Residence) (Class BS) visa to the appellant.
2 The appellant is a citizen of Fiji, who last entered Australia on 16 January 1999.
He entered on a tourist visa which was granted on 13 January 1999 and expired on 16 April 1999.
On 29 March 1999 the appellant lodged an application for a Class UK spouse visa with the Department on the basis of his marriage to Sandhya Gaudar ("the nominator"), who is an Australian citizen.
Both the appellant and the nominator advised the Department that their marriage was arranged by their families.
3 On 11 June 1999 the nominator informed the Department that she wished to withdraw her sponsorship of the appellant's visa application.
The nominator told the Department that she was forced by her family into the marriage, that the appellant knew that she was involved in a relationship with another man and that the appellant only entered the marriage to remain in Australia.
4 On 10 February 2000 the Department wrote to the appellant at his last known address and advised him that his nominator had withdrawn her sponsorship and invited him to provide evidence that he was entitled to the grant of the visa given that the relationship had ceased.
No response was received from the appellant.
5 On 21 March 2000 a delegate of the Department refused to grant the visa.
It appears that the Department was uncertain as to whether the notification requirements of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the "Act") had been complied with and it renotified the appellant of the delegate's decision by letter dated 18 November 2003 .
On 8 December 2003 the appellant applied to the Tribunal ("the First Tribunal") for a review of that decision.
The First Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate on 22 February 2005.
6 While these events were occurring the appellant applied for another visa.
On 17 November 2000, the appellant applied for a protection visa.
On 27 November 2000 the appellant's application for a protection visa was refused.
Between 2000 and 2002 the appellant unsuccessfully pursued review proceedings seeking to have this decision set aside.
7 On 5 May 2006, the Federal Magistrates Court quashed the decision of the First Tribunal and remitted the application for review to a second, differently constituted, Tribunal ("the Second Tribunal").
It is the decision of the Second Tribunal that is the subject of the present appeal.
MIGRATION REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
 8 On 30 January 2007 a hearing was conducted during which the appellant and two of his friends gave evidence.
9 On 2 February 2007, the Tribunal wrote to the applicant pursuant to s 359A of the Act and invited him to comment on information provided by him to the Department and to the First Tribunal in light of the evidence he had given to the Second Tribunal.
The appellant was also invited to comment on information provided to the Department by the nominator, and information provided in writing by other persons in support of the appellant's application.
The appellant was given nine weeks to respond.
On 13 March 2007, the appellant's migration agent was granted access to all relevant Department and Tribunal files.
The appellant's migration agent responded to the s 359A letter on 11 April 2007, the last day of the nine week period, and submitted that the Tribunal had not satisfied its obligations under s 359A of the Act as it had failed to particularise each individual inconsistency said to arise from the information contained in the s 359A letter.
10 The Tribunal noted that it failed to particularise each individual inconsistency identified in the s 359A letter.
It found that it had, nonetheless, properly discharged its obligations under s 359A of the Act as it had ensured, as far as reasonably practicable, that the appellant understood why the information was relevant.
11 The appellant claimed that he was the spouse of the nominator at the time of the application (and that therefore, he satisfied clause 820.211 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ("the Regulations ")) and that his relationship with the nominator had ceased at the time of the decision.
He further claimed that he was the victim of domestic violence.
Only a "spouse" can be a victim of domestic violence under the Regulations .
Before the Tribunal could determine whether the appellant was a victim of domestic violence, it was first required to determine whether the appellant was the spouse of the nominator at the time of application and therefore satisfied the requirements of clause 820.211 of the Regulations .
12 Under Regulation 1.15A(1)(a), a person is the spouse of another if the two persons are in a "married relationship".
Persons are in a married relationship if they are married to each other under a marriage that is recognised as valid for the purposes of the Act (Regulation 1.15A(1A)(a)) and the Minister is satisfied that: there is a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others; that the relationship between them is genuine and continuing; and that the parties live together or do not live separately and apart on a permanent basis (Regulation 1.15A(1A)(b)).
