 BACKGROUND 
 
1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 15 February 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") dated 5 June 2007 and handed down on 26 June 2007: see Yu v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 474.
The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, as it was then known, to cancel the appellant's Subclass 573 Higher Education Sector visa.
The Tribunal was not joined as a respondent but should have been.
An order will be made adding the Tribunal as the Second Respondent.
2 The appellant was born in Hong Kong and is a citizen of the United Kingdom.
On 29 September 2005 the Department of Immigration and Citizenship granted the appellant the visa.
On 27 January 2006, the appellant's university advised the Department that the appellant had completed his course earlier than anticipated, and that he had not been enrolled in any course since December 2005.
The appellant received a "Notice of intention to consider cancellation" and was advised an interview would be held on 6 September 2006.
He was invited to attend and to provide comments.
The appellant attended an interview conducted by a Departmental officer.
The appellant acknowledged that he was not enrolled in a course but stated that he was required to appear in court in several court cases relating to an incident where he was robbed and assaulted and that he was required to undertake an anger management course by court order due to an incident of violence against his girlfriend.
3 The officer did not consider that these events constituted exceptional circumstances pursuant to Regulation 2.43(2)(b) of the Migration Regulations 1994 ("the Regulations ") and found that the appellant had breached condition 8202(2)(a).
The officer decided on 6 September 2006 to cancel the visa.
The appellant was notified of the decision and his review rights.
On 22 September 2006, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the decision.
MIGRATION REVIEW TRIBUNAL 
 
4 The issue before the Tribunal was whether the delegate properly cancelled the appellant's visa under s 116(1)(b) and s 116(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") and Regulation 2.43(2)(b)(ii) on the basis that the appellant had breached condition 8202(2)(a) because he was not enrolled in a registered course.
5 The Tribunal was satisfied that the appellant had not complied with the conditions of the visa because he was not enrolled in a registered course.
While the Tribunal accepted that the appellant was required to undertake an anger management course, and give evidence in various court cases, it found that these circumstances did not affect his enrolment as they did not prevent him from enrolling in a registered course.
The Tribunal therefore found that these circumstances did not constitute "exceptional circumstances" that would explain his non-compliance, and it affirmed the decision to cancel the appellant's visa.
FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 
 
6 On 28 August 2007 the appellant filed an application seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.
