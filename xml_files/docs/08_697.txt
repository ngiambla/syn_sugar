 INTRODUCTION 
 
 1 On 22 April 2008 I delivered judgment in Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 518 , pursuant to a notice of motion filed by Cytel ('the notice of motion').
Cytel sought orders, inter alia, that a costs order against it be set aside and that it be granted time to file a notice of objection to a bill of costs issued against it.
The notice of motion was dismissed and Cytel was ordered to pay Peoplebank's costs on an indemnity basis.
2 Cytel did not appear when judgment was delivered.
Peoplebank sought an order that the costs of the notice of motion be taxed and payable forthwith ('the current costs order').
As Cytel was absent, I directed that it provide written submissions on Peoplebank's application.
Both parties have now provided submissions.
Cytel opposes the making of the current costs order.
