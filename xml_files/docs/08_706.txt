 
1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT) made on 23 March 2007.
The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is constituted by s 6 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act).
It has as its objectives and functions the conciliation of complaints made under that Act or, if a complaint cannot be resolved by conciliation, the review of the decision or conduct to which the complaint relates: ss 11 and 12 .
A complaint may be made to the SCT under ss 14AA , 14 , 14A , 15A , 15B , 15CA , 15E , 15F , 15H or 15J of the Act.
2 In this case, the SCT reviewed two decisions; one being that of the first respondent, Australian Super Pty Ltd (formerly STA) (the trustee); and the other of the second respondent, Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (the insurer) who had made decisions rejecting the applicant's claim for a Total Permanent Disablement Benefit (TPD).
3 It would seem the insurer rejected the applicant's claim on 18 August 2005.
It internally reviewed that decision but by letter dated 27 September 2005 maintained that rejection.
4 The trustee rejected the applicant's claim on 3 November 2005.
The Claims Review Committee of the trustee reviewed that decision and resolved on 16 December 2005 to maintain its decision to decline the applicant's claim on the ground that "there was not sufficient evidence to support the view that you [the applicant] met the definition of Total and Permanent Disablement.
"
 
5 An appeal lies to this Court pursuant to s 46 of the Act on a question of law: s 46(1).
The appeal is, of course, an application in the original jurisdiction of the Court: Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 24 ALR 577 at 581.
6 The SCT has been appropriately joined as the third respondent to the appeal: SAAP v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 at [43] , [91], [153] and [180].
It has filed a submitting appearance which is also appropriate: The Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13.
The Facts 
 
7 The applicant was born on 1 September 1971.
On 9 February 1999 the appellant joined the ANZ Super Advantage Superannuation Fund (ANZ) whilst employed by Bradflo Pty Ltd.
He was in that employment from 4 January 1999 until 13 August 1999.
He was a member of ANZ and was covered by the ANZ's Insurance Policy which covered its members for TPD and death.
His last insurance premium was deducted from his account on 9 September 2003.
He withdrew all his superannuation on 26 September 2003 on the basis of financial hardship.
8 On 6 November 1999 he joined the trustee as a member of its superannuation fund whilst employed as a sales representative for Ness Security Products Pty Ltd.
He was covered by a Group Life Insurance Policy No.
K003779 issued by the insurer.
9 On 9 April 2001 he commenced employment with Rexel Australia Pty Ltd as a sales clerk.
On Friday, 19 April 2002, whilst riding a motor cycle to his home from work, he was involved in an accident.
He claims that as a result of that accident he suffered injuries to his ankles, right knee and lower back.
He said he consulted a general practitioner on Sunday, 21 April 2002 and was prescribed painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication.
He said he was advised by "GP doctors and took painkillers as well as muscle relaxants" and remained in his employment until 2 August 2002.
He claims that he resigned on that day because of back pain, ankle pain, nightmares and "an extreme amount of pressure from management".
10 In October 2002, on his general practitioner's advice, he says, he commenced employment at Mayne Armaguard.
He said that that job involved very light duties and no stress.
Nevertheless, he said he was unable to continue in the employment as his pain was too intense to handle even though he had been treated with painkillers and muscle relaxants.
He resigned in November 2002.
11 He became in receipt of a Disability Support Pension from Centrelink on 13 January 2003.
12 The applicant claims that as a result of pressure exerted by Centrelink and as part of a placement by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, he commenced work in August 2003 in paid employment with Northside Mini Mix.
He said that he resigned from that employment on 30 June 2004 because of pain and suffering.
He has not been employed since that time.
13 On 6 August 2003, whilst the applicant was still a member of ANZ and covered by TPD Insurance, the applicant lodged a claim for TPD against ANZ which was rejected by Tower Australia Ltd (Tower), the insurer to ANZ, on 29 August 2005 and by ANZ on 26 September 2005.
The claim against that trustee and insurer was for $81,000.
14 The clause regulating a member's entitlement under ANZ provided:
 3.
"Total and Permanent Disablement" means the Life Insured.

 
 3.1 is unable to follow his/her usual occupation with his/her employer by reason of accident or disease for the waiting period and in the opinion of [the Insurer], after consideration of medical evidence to [the Insurer's] satisfaction is unlikely ever to be able to follow his/her usual occupation or any other occupation for which he/she could be reasonably considered qualified by education, experience or training; or 
 
 3.2 has suffered the total and irrecoverable loss or the use of: 
 
 a) both hands;
 b) both feet;
 c) one hand and one foot;
 d) the sight of both eyes;
 e) one hand and the sign of one eye; or
 f) one foot and the sight of one eye.

 
The waiting period was defined as six months.
15 ANZ rejected the applicant's claim on the basis that the applicant was not eligible to make a claim because his cover had lapsed on the relevant date.
The applicant's last insurance premium was deducted from his account on 9 September 2003 and he had withdrawn his entire benefits on 26 September 2003 on the basis of financial hardship.
ANZ noted that as the relevant TPD claim form dated 6 August 2003 recorded that the applicant had only ceased work entirely on 30 November 2003 (actually 2002), and that the applicant had worked with Northside Mini Mix until 30 June 2004, he was ineligible for any TPD benefit because he had withdrawn all of his benefits on an earlier date, viz 26 September 2003.
16 Tower decided that the applicant ceased to be entitled to any TPD benefit when he ceased paying premiums (being 9 September 2003) and any entitlement needed to have accrued before September 2003.
Tower stated that as the applicant was able to work after September 2003, he could not have been totally and permanently disabled according to the relevant definition.
17 On 20 February 2006 the applicant complained to the SCT that the decisions of ANZ and Tower were unfair or unreasonable.
The applicant submitted to the SCT that due to the motorcycle accident he suffered impact damage to his ankles, his right knee and jarred his lower back.
He outlined the medical treatment he had received for those injuries and submitted that in denying his TPD claim Tower had labelled his general practitioner and an unbiased Federal government doctor "Liars".
18 The medical reports before the SCT were:
 
1.
Treating Doctor's Report for Centrelink completed by Dr RS in January 2003.
2.
Initial Medical Report Form from Dr RS, dated 14 July 2003.
3.
Report of Dr GR after assessment of applicant for Centrelink purposes on 10 February 2003.
19 The SCT observed that there was very little medical evidence concerning the extent of the applicant's disabilities.
It stated that there was no medical evidence about the cause of the applicant's claimed disability.
The applicant had not been assessed by an orthopaedic specialist nor had he undergone a CT scan or an MRI and it had not been determined whether the motorcycle accident in 2002 aggravated his Scheuermann's disease, which he was diagnosed as suffering in 1994.
20 The SCT found that despite the applicant's TPD form stating that he had a motorcycle accident in April 2003, which was the basis upon which Tower proceeded, the accident had occurred in April 2002.
The SCT found that Tower suspected that the applicant may have manufactured his claim because of the discrepancy in the dates and therefore did not thoroughly investigate his alleged disabilities.
It consequently decided that the making of a decision in those circumstances could not have been said to operate fairly and reasonably in relation to the applicant.
21 The SCT held that ANZ and Tower did not have the necessary evidence to conclude that the applicant did not meet the definition of TPD.
Neither had sufficiently clarified the facts surrounding the applicant's accident and did not obtain appropriate specialist medical reports taking account of both the impact of the accident and the Scheuermann's disease.
The SCT held that the two decisions therefore operated unfairly and unreasonably in relation to the applicant in the circumstances.
22 On 30 October 2006 the SCT remitted that matter to ANZ and Tower in accordance with s 37(3)(b) of the Act, with the following directions:
 
 
 1.
The Insurer to obtain the opinion of a pain specialist, an orthopaedic specialist or an occupational physician; and the Complainant to attend the appointment/s arranged by the Insurer; and
 
 2.
The Insurer and Trustee to assess the Complainant's claim for payment of a TPD benefit in light of the correct facts in relation to the Complainant's accident and work history and the further medical opinion/s obtained in accordance with these directions.

 

23 The 30 October 2006 decision is important because the applicant alleges that the decision, the subject of the current appeal, is inconsistent with that decision.
24 On 29 July 2003 the insurer received the applicant's claim for TPD against the trustee, the STA Superannuation Fund.
The clause regulating that entitlement under the STA Fund provided:
 
 
 (73) "Total and Permanent Disablement" means disablement of a Member resulting from an illness, accident or injury to the Member which commenced or occurred whilst the Member was employed and whilst a Member as a result of which ---
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Member has been precluded for a period of six consecutive months after the date of occurrence of such event from following any occupation for which the Member is reasonably suited by education training or experience; and
 
 (b) the Member will, in the opinion of the Trustee after consideration of medical evidence satisfactory to it, continue to be so disabled to such an extent as to render the Member unlikely ever again to resume work in or attend to any such occupation;
 
 
 
 
 
 and "totally and permanently disabled" shall have a corresponding meaning PROVIDED THAT where at any time all or part of the Benefit payable in the event of Total and Permanent Disablement is insured with an insurance company, the term "Total and Permanent Disablement" shall bear the meaning ascribed to it in the relevant Policy in lieu of the above definition unless the Trustee in its absolute discretion otherwise determines; ...
 
 

25 The applicant was insured with the insurer so that the clause in the relevant policy applied.
