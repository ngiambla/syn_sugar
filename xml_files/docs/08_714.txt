 THE APPLICATION 
 
1 The applicant was, at all material times, an Inspector within the meaning of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the "WR Act").
At such times he was also an Australian Building and Construction Inspector appointed pursuant to s 57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (the "BCII Act").
The applicant seeks declaratory orders, pecuniary penalties and other relief in connection with admitted breaches by the first respondent ("Mr Powell"), the third respondent ("Mr McDonald") and the fourth respondent ("the CFMEU") of s 170MN of the WR Act, by the CFMEU of s 178 of that Act and by Mr Powell, the second respondent ("the CFMEUW") and the CFMEU of s 38 of the BCII Act.
THE LEGISLATION 
 
2 Section 170MN(1) of the WR Act provided as follows:
 (1) From the time when: 
 
 
 (a) a certified agreement; or 
 (b) an award under subsection 170MX(3) (which deals with the exercise of arbitration powers on termination of a bargaining period); 
 
 
 
 
 comes into operation until its nominal expiry date has passed, an employee, organisation or officer covered by subsection (2) must not, for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims against the employer in respect of the employment of employees whose employment is subject to the agreement or award, engage in industrial action.

 
 

3 Pursuant to s 170ND, s 170MN was a "penalty provision", meaning that a person who contravened it was liable to a penalty.
The maximum penalty, in the case of a corporation, was $33,000 and, in the case of a natural person, $6,600.
4 Section 178(1) provided:
 Where an organization or person bound by an award, an order of the Commission ... or a certified agreement breaches a term of the award, order or agreement, a penalty may be imposed by the Court or a court of competent jurisdiction.
In the case of a corporation, the maximum penalty was $49,500.
5 Section 38 of the BCII Act provided:
 A person must not engage in unlawful industrial action.
6 For the purposes of s 38, s 37 provided that:
 Building industrial action is unlawful industrial action if: 
 
 (a) the action is industrially motivated; and 
 (b) the action is constitutionally connected action; and 
 (c) the action is not excluded action.

 
 
7 Section 48 of the BCII Act provided:
 (1) In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears: "appropriate court" means: 
 
 
 (a) for a contravention of section 38- the Federal Court, the Federal Magistrates Court, a Supreme Court of a State or Territory or a District Court, or County Court, of a State; or 
 (b) for any other contravention-the Federal Court.

 
 
 
 
 
 
"pecuniary penalty order" means an order under paragraph 49(1)(a).
"person", in relation to a contravention of a civil penalty provision, includes an industrial association.
(2) For the purposes of this Part, a person who is involved in a contravention of a civil penalty provision is treated as having contravened that provision.
For this purpose, a person is involved in a contravention of a civil penalty provision if, and only if, the person: 
 
 (a) has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the contravention; or 
 (b) has induced the contravention, whether by threats or promises or otherwise; or 
 (c) has been in any way, by act or omission, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in or party to the contravention; or 
 (d) has conspired with others to effect the contravention.

 
 

8 Section 49(1) provided:
 An appropriate court, on application by an eligible person, may make one or more of the following orders in relation to a person (the defendant) who has contravened a civil penalty provision: 
 
 (a) an order imposing a pecuniary penalty on the defendant; 
 (b) an order requiring the defendant to pay a specified amount to another person as compensation for damage suffered by the other person as a result of the contravention; 
 (c) any other order that the court considers appropriate.

 
 

9 The BCII Act received the Royal Assent on 12 September 2005.
However, pursuant to s 2, ss 36, 37 and 38 commenced on 9 March 2005.
Sections 48 and 49, which were part of Chapter 7, commenced on 12 September 2005.
The relevant conduct in this case occurred in August 2005.
There is a question as to whether, for present purposes, ss 48 and 49 apply to the conduct which is said to have contravened s 38.
I will return to this matter at a later stage.
AGREED FACTS 
 
10 The parties have prepared a statement of agreed facts, a copy of which is annexed to these reasons.
It will assist in understanding the case if I give a broad outline of the relevant circumstances.

It was a very large project.
