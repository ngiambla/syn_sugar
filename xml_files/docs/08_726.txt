 
1 This is an appeal from orders made by Scarlett FM on 17 September 2007 dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the RRT"): see SZHFX v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1575.
On 10 August 2005 the RRT had affirmed a decision by a delegate of the then Minister of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refusing the appellants a protection visa.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
2 The appellants, a mother and her three sons, are Bangladeshi citizens.
The second appellant made independent claims for protection, although they were based on the same facts as those relied upon by his mother.
The third and fourth appellants made no independent protection claims.
They relied solely instead upon the claims made by their mother.
3 The appellants arrived in Australia on 30 July 2004.
Within a month, they applied for protection visas.
On 20 October 2004 the Minister's delegate refused their application.
4 In her written application in support of her protection claim, the first appellant outlined the basis upon which she feared persecution.
She said that she was afraid that a man named Kala Jahangir ("Jahangir") would "harm us".
Shortly before she left Bangladesh with her sons, she said that Jahangir had threatened to kidnap her eldest son unless he was paid a sum of money.
She also referred to a local Awami League leader, named Sadeq Hossain Khoka, who she said might return to where she lived and "create serious problems" for local BNP members "as well as us".
She described her husband as being a "simple active member" of the Bangladesh National Party ("BNP").
5 In her son's written application, he referred to Jahangir as being a "well-known terror" [sic] and BNP member.
He said that Jahangir had demanded money from his father and threatened to kidnap him from his school if it was not paid.
6 In an accompanying submission, the appellants' solicitor wrote that the first appellant feared for her safety, and that of her children, primarily because of her husband's political activities.
Although he had been associated with the BNP, which was at that stage in Government, factionalism within that party had led to tension and hostility.
In addition, the solicitor produced various documents describing the chaotic state of law and order in Bangladesh.
The first appellant subsequently provided a further submission in support of her protection claim in the form of a statutory declaration.
7 The Minister's delegate rejected the application on the ground that any persecution that the first appellant might fear was not for a Convention reason.
On 8 November 2004, the appellant sought review of that decision.
8 On 24 February 2005 the RRT conducted a hearing at which the first appellant gave evidence.
In response to questions by the Member, the appellant said that Jahangir had not set any deadline for the extortion demand that he had made in relation to her son.
She acknowledged that there had been no kidnapping and no money was paid.
She also acknowledged that no harm had befallen her husband but claimed that this was because he was careful and lived in more than one house in the area.
9 The Member said that it seemed odd that a noted terrorist like Jahangir, who came up on internet searches and had been linked with assassinations and actual kidnappings, had not kidnapped her son first and then given her a deadline by which to pay a ransom.
The Member added that it struck him as odd that Jahangir would threaten to kidnap her son, giving her the opportunity to hide him, and thereby defeat Jahangir's entire enterprise.
The first appellant replied that Jahangir was a notorious person, and that he had done these things before.
The Member again reiterated that the whole scenario seemed odd, and that the description given of Jahangir's conduct portrayed him as an "inept strategist".
He added "that doesn't seem like the terrorist that we read about in these news reports".
10 The Member challenged the authenticity of a letter purporting to come from a Bangladesh-based lawyer supporting the appellants' case, suggesting that it had been solicited for money.
He further suggested that there was considerable evidence that the police had been trying to arrest Jahangir.
11 The Member asked the first appellant why she had decided to stay in Australia with her children when the original plan was simply that the son, against whom the kidnapping threats had been made, would remain in Australia to attend school.
She explained that she had decided to stay in Australia after her husband telephoned her to say that a bomb had exploded at a public meeting in Dhaka on or about 21 August 2004.
12 The Member suggested to the first appellant that the evidence that she had given at the hearing differed significantly from that set out in her statutory declaration.
She replied that her husband had dictated the contents of the statutory declaration to her uncle in Australia and that she had signed it without being aware of its contents.
The Member expressed scepticism regarding that assertion.
He was also sceptical about the authenticity of other documents tendered on her behalf.
He said that he had researched about six hundred internet sites and that there was nothing in any of them to suggest that Jahangir was a member of the BNP, as she had claimed.
He added that he was having difficulty in seeing any Convention nexus to the persecution that she claimed to fear.
13 After the hearing, the appellants' solicitors wrote to the RRT enclosing a further statutory declaration, this time from a former BNP activist.
That person said that he did not know whether Jahangir was a member of the BNP.
However, he did know that he was a "hired gun" used by BNP politicians to terrorise and kill their political enemies.
He was aware that Jahangir was associated with Khoka, who was the BNP mayor of Dhaka.
He said that some years earlier, he had been telephoned by Jahangir and threatened with violence and knew of others who had been similarly threatened.
He was aware that Jahangir had threatened kidnapping if payment were not made.
Because of Jahangir's fearsome reputation, threats alone were often sufficient.
14 On 24 May 2005 the RRT wrote to the appellants' solicitor, purportedly in compliance with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
The first items of information that were disclosed were:
 "The Tribunal found a report to the effect that Jahangir was convicted in May 2003 of the August 2000 murder of a local BNP leader, Advocate Habibur Rahman Mondal (htpp://www.weeklyholiday.net/300503/last.html).
He was convicted during the current BNP government, which was elected in October 2001.
Another report observes that the Awami League leader Sheikh Hassina has been alleging, 'the BNP-Jamaat alliance government has been patronizing the terrorist groups including that led by notorious criminal Kala Jahangir to carry out its elimination against Awami League stalwarts' ('Coastal land grabbing blamed on men blessed by BNP bigwigs,' Awami League website, Thursday 19 May 2005, http://www,albd.org/news/2005/05/19/19 1.htm).
" 
15 The RRT observed that the evidence did not support the first appellant's suggestion that Jahangir was under the protection of powerful persons within the BNP as he had been convicted of murder during the period of the BNP government.
The Sheikh Hassina allegations, even if correct, were not evidence of Jahangir being used to help purge parts of the BNP from within, as was claimed by the first appellant.
16 There were also second and third items of information provided.
However, they are of no relevance to this appeal.
17 The appellants' solicitors replied on 12 July 2005 to the s 424A letter and made further submissions thereafter.
However, these were to no avail.
On 1 September 2005, the RRT affirmed the delegate's decision under review.
THE RRT'S REASONS FOR DECISION 
 
18 After canvassing the appellants' claims and submissions in detail, the RRT referred to what it described as the "Independent evidence about Kala Jahangir".
Under that heading it summarised the matters referred to earlier.
Notably, it said:
 "The evidence located by the Tribunal after an extensive Google search of news media sites and commentary pages, did not appear to support a position to the effect that Jahangir has been aligned with the ruling faction of the BNP.
" 
19 The appellants rely upon this passage in the RRT's reasons for decision as one basis upon which the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to set it aside.
They submit that the contents of this passage were not disclosed to the first appellant during the course of the hearing or in the s 424A letter to the appellant.
20 The RRT continued by summarising various submissions before setting out its findings.
It said that it had considerable difficulties with the first appellant's evidence.
It found that there was no reliable evidence of any kidnap threat ever having been made.
The Member said:
 "The behaviour the Applicant attributed to Kala Jahangir in her claims does not closely, or otherwise convincingly, resemble the cunning and ruthless behaviour attributed to him in independent reports.
In the Applicant's account, Jahangir did not use any agents or intermediarie but made the call himself ...
According to the Applicant's evidence he behaved throughout the whole affair like an amateur, or at least as though he was improvising the plot as he went along.
" 
21 This passage formed the basis of a second complaint regarding failure to comply with s 424A.
The appellants claim that they were not provided with particulars of the information relied on from the "independent reports" referred to by the RRT to justify the conclusion that Jahangir was "cunning and ruthless" and not an inept amateur.
That finding was used by the RRT as one basis upon which it disbelieved the first appellant and rejected her as a witness of credibility.
22 The RRT ultimately found that the claimed persecution, even if it had occurred, was not Convention related.
It characterised any kidnap threat as a purely criminal matter, unrelated to any link Jahangir might have had with the BNP.
THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S DECISION 
 
23 As previously indicated, the appellants alleged two breaches of s 424A before the Federal Magistrate.
