 INTRODUCTION 
 Nature of the proceedings 
 
1 These two proceedings are two of nine related class actions or representative proceedings under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (FCA Act) against the same respondent (Veda).
Veda was once called "Baycorp Advantage Business Information Services Limited".
2 The nine proceedings and the applicants in them respectively are as follows:
 NSD 368 of 2007 Melissa Marie Szyczew NSD 369 of 2007 Catherine Leanne Lyons NSD 370 of 2007 Cheryl A Matthews NSD 371 of 2007 Andrew Bailey 
 (the Bailey proceeding) NSD 372 of 2007 David William Hines NSD 373 of 2007 Matthew Zion Rose NSD 377 of 2007 Albert William Kapua NSD 378 of 2007 Stephen John Gregory NSD 393 of 2007 Zashca Knochell
 (the Knochell proceeding) 

 
I will often refer to "the applicants" in the plural, even though the two notices of motion with which these reasons are concerned were each filed in only one of the proceedings (being the Bailey proceeding or the Knochell proceeding) as outlined below.
It is common ground that the two motions have application to all nine proceedings.
3 The Bailey proceeding is the lead proceeding.
Down to the present time all interlocutory steps have been taken in the Bailey proceeding on the basis that they would also have application to the other eight proceedings.
Unfortunately, the solicitors representing the applicants discovered that they had misspelt Ms Knochell's first name as "Zashca".
They filed the notice of motion to which I refer below in the Knochell proceeding rather than in the Bailey proceeding, apparently in order to seek an order that Ms Knochell's name as it appears in the title of the Knochell proceeding be corrected (I note, in passing, that they also wrongly stated Veda's name as "Veda Advantage Information Service and Solutions Limited" rather than "Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited" on the notice of motion and supporting affidavit).
This has led to the anomaly that whereas until the present time all interlocutory steps have been taken in the Bailey proceeding, of the two motions to which the present reasons relate, one is brought by Ms Knochell in the Knochell proceeding, while the other is brought by Veda in the Bailey proceeding.
4 Of the nine class actions, three relate to events in New South Wales, three to events in Victoria, and the remaining three to events in Queensland.
5 In Bailey v Veda Advantage Information Services and Solutions Limited [2007] FCA 1664 (the Earlier Reasons), I described the general nature of the nine proceedings as follows (at [3]-[6]):
 3 All nine are brought by individuals on behalf of themselves and others whose complaints concern information provided by Veda to credit providers relating to the creditworthiness of the applicants and of the group members they respectively represent.
Veda is a credit reporting agency, that is to say, it is a corporation that carries on a credit reporting business (I am using expressions taken from the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), ss 6 and 11A ).
4 Credit providers subscribe to Veda in order to have the benefit of information related to the creditworthiness of individuals who apply to them for credit.
Veda maintains credit information files on a computer database in relation to individuals.
The credit providers who subscribe are able to access, by computer, the credit information files that are part of the system set up by Veda.
In addition, the subscribers themselves may update the information on those files by providing information known to them concerning individuals.
5 Accordingly, Veda's subscribers are both the suppliers of information to the credit information files and the recipients of information from those files.
I was told that on the final hearing there will be considerable evidence concerning the way in which the system just outlined operates.
6 In the way in which the proceedings have been cast, each of the three relates to the reporting of a particular kind of problem associated with a person's creditworthiness.
In the case of proceeding NSD 368/2007 in which Ms Szyczew is the applicant, the complaint is that the word "Bankrupts" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Ms Szyczew and the members of the group on whose behalf she sues.
In the case of proceeding NSD 371/2007 in which Mr Bailey is the applicant, the complaint is that the expression "Clearouts" or "Clearouts (watched)" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Mr Bailey and the members of the group on whose behalf he sues.
I infer that what is meant by those expressions is that the person, owing money, has ceased to be contactable.
In proceeding NSD 393/2007 in which Mr Knochell is the applicant, the complaint is that the expression "Payment Default" was recorded and conveyed to subscribers in respect of Mr Knochell and the members of the group on whose behalf he sues.
I note that the subscribers are also referred to as "members".
6 In each proceeding, claims were made of contravention by Veda of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TP Act), defamation and negligence.
The claims of contravention of s 53 of the TP Act and of defamation have now been abandoned.
Circumstances leading to the filing of the present motions 
 
7 On 20 February 2008, I made the following orders in each of the nine proceedings:
 
 
 1.
The proceeding be dismissed.
2.
The applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding.
3.
Orders 1 and 2 not be entered without the leave of the Court.
4.
The respondent have leave to apply by motion on notice for leave to enter orders 1 and 2.
5.
The applicant have leave to apply by motion on notice for an order setting aside orders 1 and 2.
6.
The motion referred to in order 5 above be supported by affidavit attaching a copy of any proposed further amended application and proposed further amended statement of claim.
