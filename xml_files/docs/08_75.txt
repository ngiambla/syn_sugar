 Introduction 
 
 Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd is a large Australian retailer of jewellery.
It regularly advertises its jewellery for sale in a way that has attracted the attention of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC").
It does so by publishing and distributing catalogues to the public promoting the sale of a range of jewellery items and offering each item for sale at a price described as a "now" price near a picture of the item and another price described as the "was" price.
The "was" price is higher, and often much higher, than the "now" price.
ACCC contends this method of promotion is misleading and deceptive.
It alleges that Prouds has contravened ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ").
The gravamen of ACCC's case is that the "was" price would be viewed as a previous selling price but the price at which, historically, each item was actually sold was often less.

 An overview of the facts 
 
 The evidence in these proceedings was mainly documentary though a number of affidavits were read and some of the witnesses were cross-examined.
The evidence was given by Mr Searles (a director of the enforcement and coordination branch of ACCC), Dr Ferrier (accountant), Ms Bogan (a cluster manager for Prouds), Mr Cockayne (previously the merchandise manager for Prouds and currently the General Manager of Goldmark Jewellers Pty Ltd), Ms Mangelsdorf (a director of Prouds), Ms Osborne (gold jewellery buyer for Prouds).
I understood Ms Osborne's affidavit was not read but her evidence was, nonetheless, relied on in final submissions.
Mr Cockayne and Ms Mangelsdorf were cross-examined.
In addition, some facts were agreed by the parties (in a statement of agreed facts) and others were admitted in the pleadings.
From this material the following emerges.
In these reasons, unless I indicate otherwise, recounting facts constitutes findings of fact.
Prouds publishes catalogues in which it offers jewellery for sale at discounted prices for a limited period.
These proceedings concern 17 items of jewellery promoted for sale in two catalogues entitled "Summer of Love" and "Love You Mum".
In those catalogues, the jewellery items were advertised using a "was" price and a "now" price.
The form of the catalogues is exemplified by the front pages of each which are reproduced in schedule 1 to these reasons.
In one instance a pair of earrings had a "were" price but for convenience, that will be treated as a "was" price.
Schedule 2 sets out "was" and "now" prices appearing in the Summer of Love catalogue for each of the 17 items of jewellery and schedule 3 sets out those prices for the relevant items appearing in the Love You Mum catalogue.
The Summer of Love catalogue was first published by Prouds on 29 January 2006.
In total, 5,390,711 copies were printed and distributed predominantly by letterbox drop (4,944,711 copies) but also by providing copies at Prouds stores (291,700 copies) and distributing them through newspaper inserts (154,300 copies).
Copies of the catalogue were distributed on 31 January and 7 February 2006.
On the back of the catalogue were the words "All offers valid while stocks last or until offer ends 28/02/06.
" The Love You Mum catalogue was first published on 23 April 2006.
In total, 5,552,821 copies were printed and were distributed by similar means and in similar proportions as the Summer of Love catalogue.
On the back of the Love You Mum catalogue were the words "All offers valid while stocks last or until offer ends 15/05/06".
The audience for both catalogues was agreed by the parties to be "the public generally".
Prouds has over 140 outlets.
The jewellery industry is highly competitive.
Prouds, like its competitors, discounts jewellery.
That is, jewellery is sold at less than the price marked on the price tag or ticket attached to the goods.
It is an agreed fact that because of the competitive nature of the industry, in order to make sales, Prouds would often sell items of jewellery that were not already discounted through part of a promotion or sale, at prices that were below the regular marked price.
This could be as a result of any of a variety of discount policies as well as a general discretion that sales staff had to offer discounts in order to secure sales.
Details of these policies and the level of discounting are in evidence as part of the agreed facts.
Suffice it to say that if the consumer was aware that discounts were available and was aware that it was possible to negotiate paying something less than the regular marked price, it is probable that that particular consumer could, at least in certain circumstances, purchase the item for less than the regular marked price.
I should note that ACCC challenged the use of the expression regular marked price given the constant cycle of discounting deployed by Prouds (discussed shortly).
There is some force in this contention and I use the expression for convenience only.

 The pleaded contravening conduct 
 
 ACCC alleged that the publication of the catalogues by Prouds gave rise to five representations which entailed misleading and deceptive conduct.
