1 Merlin BV is a company incorporated in Holland.
It is apparently a not-for-profit company which was established in 2007 to operate as a non-exclusive licensing agency, and to protect the intellectual property of independent record labels.
It currently represents over 10,000 record labels from around the world.
2 By a Notice of Motion filed 2 April 2008 Merlin seeks orders under O 46 r 6 of the Federal Court Rules for leave to inspect and copy a large number of documents on the Court file in respect of proceedings in the matter of Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Licence Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 ; (2005) 65 IPR 289.
3 Those proceedings are commonly known as "the Kazaa proceedings" which are said to have been the largest copyright case ever brought before an Australian court, and amongst the largest intellectual property cases in the world.
4 The Notice of Motion as originally filed sought access to an extraordinarily wide range of material.
It appears on its face to extend to almost every document in the now defunct court file.
However, Merlin subsequently confined the application in a way that I will refer to later.
Even then, the application seeks a large body of material.
5 Merlin's application was opposed by a number of parties to the Kazaa proceedings.
The principal opponents were a number of record companies in the EMI, Sony BMG, Universal and Warner Groups ("the Record Companies") who were applicants in the Kazaa proceedings and by the sixth to ninth respondents in those proceedings.
The sixth to ninth respondents are referred to as the "Altnet Respondents".
6 The application raises an important question of principle which does not seem to have been dealt with in any earlier authority.
Although Dr Bell invoked the principle of open justice, referred to in cases such as Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 225 ALR 256 , ultimately he put the application on the footing that it was for access to justice.
7 The purpose for which Merlin seeks access to the documents is to obtain information concerning possible infringements of its members' copyright in the same period as was covered by the Kazaa proceedings.
Merlin seeks to obtain evidence of copyright infringement by the respondents to the Kazaa proceedings, by the same conduct as was in issue in those proceedings.
8 The essential issue which arises is whether a non-party ought to be given access to a defunct court file in order to gather evidence for a case it (or, more accurately, some of its members) may wish to bring against the respondents to the Kazaa proceedings in circumstances in which the non-party cannot satisfy the requirements for an order for preliminary discovery under O 15A of the Federal Court Rules .
9 A number of discretionary considerations are raised by the Record Companies and the Altnet Respondents including delay, prejudice and the failure of Merlin to offer any of the protections, including compensation, as would be provided by an application under O 15A, or upon the service of a subpoena.
The Kazaa Proceedings 
 
10 The Kazaa proceedings were commenced by way of the largest number of Anton Pillar orders ever made in Australia.
There were simultaneous raids on twelve locations in three states of Australia.
At the time of the execution of the Anton Pillar orders, sixty members of the firm of solicitors representing the Record Companies and associated applicants were engaged in the matter.
11 The Kazaa proceedings concerned copyright infringement by the respondents in 98 specified sound recordings.
When the proceedings were commenced, other sound recordings were included in the claim but the proceedings were ultimately confined to the number referred to above.
12 Sixty one affidavits, many of them lengthy, made by 34 witnesses, were read at the trial.
Seventeen witnesses gave oral evidence.
The trial judge, Wilcox J, observed that whilst an enormous quantity of evidence was tendered, little of it was the subject of objection by the parties.
13 The judgment of Wilcox J was handed down on 5 September 2005.
His Honour found that each of the 98 recordings had been able to be downloaded, and had been downloaded, through the file-sharing facility of the Kazaa system: Universal Music v Sharman at [17].
His Honour also found at [181] that a major use of the Kazaa system was the transmission of copyright material.
At [186], Wilcox J made a finding that the Kazaa file sharing system:
 
 ... necessarily involved copyright infringement on a massive scale.

 

14 His Honour's findings were expressed in summary form in [194] as follows:
 
 In short, I find that all the respondents knew the predominant use of Kazaa was for the sharing of copyright-infringing material.
None of them had an interest to prevent or curtail that predominant use; if anything, the contrary.
Each of the respondents was at least acquiescent in the use of Kazaa for copyright-infringing activities.

 

15 Following his Honour's orders, Sharman Networks Ltd, the second respondent in the Kazaa proceedings agreed to pay US$115 million to the Record Companies and movie studios who had brought the proceedings.
16 An appeal was lodged against his Honour's judgment but the proceedings were apparently settled in about August 2006.
The documents sought 
 
17 In an affidavit sworn in support of Merlin's application by Ms Julie Robb, solicitor, on 15 April 2007, the deponent refers to inspections that have so far been made by her firm of documents on the Court file that are publicly available under O 46 r 6(2).
18 Ms Robb goes on to say that as a result of those inspections, and her reading of the judgment of Wilcox J, eight documents or classes of documents:
 
 may contain information that Merlin seeks in order to prosecute its members' claims.

 

19 The eight documents or classes are as follows:
 
(a) affidavit of Anthony Johnsen dated 29 September 2004;
 
(b) affidavit of Philip Morle dated 24 November 2004;
 
(c) the digital music files produced by Mr Morle as part of the discovery process, whether in the form that existed on the computers at his premises, or in the form they had been recovered by the forensic technician;
 
(d) the digital music files produced by the Sharman parties as part of the discovery process;
 
(e) affidavit of Tom Mizzone sworn 1 December 2004;
 
(f) all affidavits of Ms Ball of Gilbert + Tobin concerning the evidence of specific infringements collected by her;
 
(g) the digital music files collected from university campuses on the execution of Anton Piller orders on 6 February 2004 copied by Mr Lyons from computers at the offices of Baker  McKenzie; and
 
(h) all affidavits of Mr Lyons related or referring to this material.
20 Ms Robb also says in her affidavit that she believes any method other than access under O 46 r 6 would be attended by significantly greater cost and difficulty, including costs to be incurred by third parties.
She goes on to say:
 
 I have considered whether Merlin could commence proceedings for preliminary discovery under Order 15A.
However, I am concerned that, without access to the material it presently seeks, Merlin cannot identify which of its members would be the proper applicants to such proceedings.

 

21 However, the documents sought on the application were further narrowed.
The documents were described in Exhibit A1 in this application as follows:
 
 
 (a) all affidavits and exhibits identified in paragraph 24(a), (b), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Mr Williams' affidavit [sworn 17 April 2008]; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) the digital music files referred to in paragraph 24(d) of Mr Williams' affidavit; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) the "Applicants' Main Tender Bundle", the index to which is reproduced at pages 42 to 60 of Exhibit MJW-1A to Mr Williams' affidavit; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) the appeal books filed in the appeal from the Main Proceedings; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (e) the transcripts of the Main Proceedings.

 
 
 

22 For convenience, I will reproduce the paragraphs of Mr Williams' affidavit listed in Exhibit A1 as follows: 
 
 
 (a) Affidavit of Johnson.
The body of affidavit makes no reference to any recordings by the artists set out at paragraph 2.6 of Ms Robb's affidavit sworn 15 April 2008 ( Merlin Artists).
There are 4 references in Exhibit AEJ-1 to recordings by the Merlin Artists (pages 5, 8 and 16).

 (b) Affidavit of Phil Morle .
The body of the affidavit makes no reference to any recordings by the Merlin Artists.
Exhibit PDFM-1 contains lists of the files that were discovered by Mr Morle.
There are 43 references to recordings by the Merlin Artists.

 


 ... 

 
 
 (d) Digital music files discovered by the Sharman respondents.
Sharman discovered 2 recordings by the Merlin Artists.

 
 
 
 
 
 (e) Affidavit of Tom Mizzone.
The body of the affidavit of [sic] makes no reference to any recordings.
There are also no references to the Merlin Artists in Exhibit TM-2.
In the time available the Record Companies have not be [sic] able to review Exhibit TM-3 to determine whether there are any recordings by any of the Merlin Artists in Exhibit TM-3.

 
 
 
 
 
 (f) Affidavits of Ball.
The body of the affidavit of Elise Ball sworn 27 January 2004 makes no reference to any recordings.
There are 9 references to Merlin Artists on a screenshot which is contained on page 36 of Exhibit EEB-3.

 
 
 
 
 
 (g) Digital music files seized from the Universities.
These will not be on the Court file because the seized information was held by the independent solicitor following the execution of the orders and subsequently a limited class of data relating to the case brought by the Record Companies was extracted by a computer forensic expert.
Of the extracted files, there are only 2 references to one of the Merlin Artists (Billy Bragg) that appear on Exhibit NJC-3 to the affidavit of Nigel Carson sworn 12 August 2004.

 
 
 
 
 
 (h) Affidavits of Mr Lyons.
The bodies of the affidavits make no reference to any recordings.
There are no references in the non-confidential exhibits to Mr Lyons' affidavits to any recordings by any of the Merlin Artists.
