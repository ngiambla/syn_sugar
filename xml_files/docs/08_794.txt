 
1 The applicant, the Deputy Commissioner for Taxation, petitions for a sequestration order under s 43 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act ") in respect of the estate of the respondent, Mr Brian Cumins.
The amended petition pleads that the respondent owes the applicant $38,032,100.01.
The alleged act of bankruptcy relied upon is the failure, by the respondent, amongst other things, to comply, on or before 18 September 2006, with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice deemed served on him on 4 August 2006.
The bankruptcy notice was issued on 17 March 2006.
BACKGROUND 
 
2 The respondent, Mr Cumins, invested in excess of $5 million in what he described as "Infomercial Schemes" between 1996 and 1998.
An "Infomercial", according to the respondent, is an advertising film which is generally shown on television and promotes a product in an informative and objective style.
3 On 23 October 2000, the applicant issued Notices of Amended Assessments to the respondent for the years ended 30 June as follows:
 
 
 Year Ended Amount 
 1996 $ 3,344,884.24
 1997 $ 2,836,956.98
 1998 $12,954,263.05
 TOTAL $19,136,104.27 
 

4 Those assessments were related to tax deductions claimed by the respondent in connection with his investments in the Infomercial Schemes.
Those tax deductions were disallowed by the applicant.
5 On 23 November 2000 the applicant issued further Notices of Amended Assessments to the respondent for the years ended 30 June as follows: 
 
 
 Year Amount 
 1995 $ 243,360.31
 1996 $ 123,141.55
 1998 $2,619,580.49
 TOTAL $2,986,082.35 
 

6 In February 2001 the applicant filed a writ in the Supreme Court of Western Australia to recover from the respondent the amounts of both the October and November 2000 assessments as well as interest and other charges.
7 On 3 August 2001 the respondent commenced review proceedings in the AAT in respect of each of the applicant's decisions to disallow the respondent's objections to the assessments issued on 23 October 2000.
In February 2005 the respondent withdrew the proceedings.
Pursuant to s 42(A)1B of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) the affect of the withdrawal was that the AAT proceedings were considered to have been dismissed.
8 In Australian Securities  Investments Commission v Infomercial Management Group Pty Ltd [2002] VSC 262 at [58] the Supreme Court of Victoria held that certain Infomercial schemes were a fraud on the investors, if not on the Australian Taxation Office.
These schemes, so claims the respondent, were the ones in which he had invested.
9 Importantly, other than in relation to a very small sum comprised in the 1998 assessment, none of the November 2000 assessments concerned the respondent's investments in the Infomercial Schemes.
The assessment for 1998 for $2,619,580.49 was subject to objections by the respondent.
These objections failed, as did a subsequent review before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).
In February 2005 an appeal to this Court from the decision of the AAT was dismissed by consent.
The November 2000 assessments for 1995 and 1996 have never been the subject of an application for review or legal challenge.
10 On 15 June 2005 the applicant obtained summary judgment in the Supreme Court of Western Australia against the respondent for the sum of $38,084,522.24, including interest.
The respondent did not consent to the judgment but did not oppose it.
11 On 17 March 2006 the Deputy Commissioner issued a bankruptcy notice which was deemed served on the respondent on 4 August 2006 requiring payment, within 21 days after service, in the amount of $38,051,066.24.
The amount demanded comprised the sum of the judgment less an amount of $33,456 described in the bankruptcy notice as "payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders".
The bankruptcy notice was in the form prescribed: Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth), reg 4.02, Form 1.
The Schedule set out the amount claimed by the applicant to be due as follows:
 SCHEDULE 
 
 
 Column 1 Column 2 
 1.
Amount of judgments or order $38,084,522.24 plus 2.
Legal costs if ordered to be paid and a specific amount was not included in the judgments or orders (see Note 1, below) $0.00 plus 3.
If claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, interest accrued since the date of judgments or orders (see Note 2, below) $0.00 
 4.
Subtotal $38,084,522.24 less 5.
Payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders $33,456.00 
 6.
Total debt owing $38,051,066.24 

 
12 The respondent has failed to comply with the bankruptcy notice or to satisfy otherwise the provisions contained in s 40(1)(g) of the Act .
