 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The second respondent, the Port of Melbourne Corporation (PoMC), proposes to deepen shipping channels in Port Philip Bay and the Yarra River (the Project).
The applicant, Blue Wedges Inc, challenges the legal validity of a decision of the first respondent (the Federal Minister) made on 20 December 2007 (the Approval Decision) approving the Project under s 133 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the Environment Act).
2 Blue Wedges' basic contention is that the Project has substantially changed since the legislative approval process began.
The Federal Minister, it says, must start again.
3 The present litigation does not call for a decision on the environmental or economic merits of the Project.
Rather, the Court is asked to find that the Approval Decision is invalid because the procedures laid down by law have not been followed.
