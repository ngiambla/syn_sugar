 Craig Hoy was interested in setting up business on his own account as a franchisee of a mobile phone retail business.
He had been working as a marketing manager for a medium sized mobile phone retailer with about ten outlets.
In about September 2002 he approached Matthew Donnellan, then the general manager of Allphones Retail Pty Limited.
Allphones was a mobile phone franchisor that had begun operating in Western Australia.
By the time Mr Hoy met with Mr Donnellan, Allphones was expanding its operations onto the eastern seaboard.
It had had a small number of outlets in New South Wales.
These were franchised stores.
They operated in large retail shopping centres or shopping malls.
Mr Donnellan explained that one of the features of Allphones' business model was that, through its franchisees, it offered retail customers the opportunity to enter into contracts for the provision of mobile phone services with a range of telecommunications service providers, such as Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, Hutchison (or '3') and other carriers or networks.
Allphones could complete with other mobile phone retail outlets which were tied to individual carriers because it could offer various plans or deals with a range of carriers through its expanding franchise base.
Thus, a customer who wanted to buy a mobile phone in an Allphones store could choose which carrier, and which plan or deal offered by that carrier, he or she wished to select.
The model made the carriers competitive with one another about the plans or deals they would offer Allphones' stores.
The various carriers offered different mobile phones with differing plans or deals, although there was some overlap on the more popular models of phones at the various levels of plans or deals.
The Trade Practices (Industry Codes-Franchising) Regulations 1998 (Cth) made the Franchising Code of Conduct as a mandatory industry code to which ss 51AD and 51AE of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) applied.
The Code governed the relationship that Allphones had with its actual and potential franchisees.
The purpose of the Code was to regulate the conduct of participants in franchising towards other participants in franchising (cl 2(1)).
It required a franchisor to create a disclosure document for actual and prospective franchisees in accordance with the requirements of Div 2.1 of the Code both before entry into a franchise agreement, and also within three months after the end of each financial year after the agreement had been made (cl 6(1)).
The purposes of the disclosure document were to give a prospective franchisee or an existing one who might wish to continue or renew the relationship: The Code prescribed that a franchisee be given a considerable amount of information (see esp Annexure 1 to the Code).
Critically, a franchisor was required to give to a franchisee a statement whether the franchise was for an exclusive or non-exclusive territory or was limited to a particular site (Annexure 1, cl 8.1).
A franchisor was also required to give a copy of the Code and a disclosure document to a prospective franchisee at least 14 days before the franchisee entered into a franchise agreement (cl 10).
Importantly, the franchisor must not enter into a franchise agreement unless it had received from the franchisee or prospective franchisee a written statement that the franchisee or prospective franchisee had received, read and had a reasonable opportunity to understand the disclosure document and the Code (cl 11(1)).
And, before a franchisee agreement could be entered into, the franchisor must have received from the prospective franchisee signed statements that the prospective franchisee had been given advice about the proposed franchise agreement or business by an independent legal advisor, independent business advisor or independent accountant.
If no such statement were received, the franchisor had to receive from the prospective franchisee a signed statement, indicating that it had been given that kind of advice about the proposed franchise agreement or business or had been told that he or she should seek that advice but had decided not to seek it (cl 11(2)).
In this case, both parties agree that a disclosure statement was provided to Mr Hoy in about September 2002, but neither party has a copy of it and neither party can identify the contents.
Additionally, both parties agree that a written franchise agreement was signed, but, once again, neither has a copy of it.
They have, however, agreed that an unsigned version dated 27 June 2003 contained the written terms on which they entered into their franchise agreement for Hoy Mobile to operate as an Allphones franchise from a store in a Westfield shopping centre at Eastgardens, a suburb of Sydney.
Before the franchise agreement was signed, Allphones should have ensured that Hoy Mobile Pty Limited or Mr Hoy and his wife, Nicole, gave it one or more of the statements required by cl 11 of the Code.
Hoy Mobile was the company which formed to conduct the franchise business.
However, no statements under cl 11 were given to Allphones.
And, more remarkably, the franchise agreement described Hoy Mobile's exclusive territory as 'N/A', an abbreviation for 'not applicable'.
In that context, it is unsurprising that there is a dispute between the parties about the territory.
Allphones asserted that its failures to comply with the Code lead to the result that any franchise agreement entered into between the parties was void.
And, both sides accuse the other of having committed serious financial irregularities in their relationship.
On the one hand, Mr Hoy has admitted that he committed fraud in the operation of the franchise business by unlocking and selling previously locked mobile phones for more than what he accounted and paid to Allphones in respect of the sales.
On the other hand, Allphones did not pay to Hoy Mobile all the commissions that it had agreed to share.
Nor did Allphones disclose, at material times, that the total commissions it reported to its franchisees, including Hoy Mobile, as payable by telecommunications carriers for sales they effected, had been deliberately understated by Allphones.
Allphones kept the difference and did not share it with the franchisees as it was obliged to do so.
After learning of Mr Hoy's fraud, Allphones wished to rely on it to terminate the franchise agreement.
Hoy Mobile claimed that Allphones was not in a position to terminate, first because it was itself in breach of essential terms of the franchise agreement and secondly, it had affirmed the franchise agreement by requiring Hoy Mobile to perform obligations under it, having full knowledge of the fraud committed by Mr Hoy.
The litigation has been particularly hard fought.
The trial took over 16 days to hear.
There were substantive disputes between the parties as to significant conversations and other events in their now dysfunctional relationship.
Even so, the issues and amounts over which the parties have been fighting appear to be out of all proportion to the legal costs which each has incurred.
Hoy Mobile claimed approximately $300,000 in underpaid commissions and damages.
It also sought orders protecting its entitlement to be a franchisee.
Allphones claimed to be entitled to bring the relationship to an end.
1.
PRE-AGREEMENT DISCUSSIONS 
 In about mid-2002 Mr Hoy noticed that an Allphones store had opened in Castle Hill, a suburb of Sydney.
He thought that this was an unpromising location but he observed that the outlet appeared to be trading successfully.
For the previous ten years Mr Hoy had worked for Ryder Communications.
It was an exclusive retail dealer for the carrier, Optus, selling mobile phones and telecommunications services to the public.
Mr Hoy approached Michael Davidson, a former Optus employee whom he knew to be then working at Allphones.
Mr Davidson introduced Mr Hoy to Mark McLennan of Allphones, who made an appointment for him to see Mr Donnellan.
They first met in September 2002.
At the time, both had been working in the telecommunications industry for many years.
At their first meeting, Mr Donnellan explained the Allphones business model to Mr Hoy essentially as follows.
Allphones provided franchisees with stock on consignment for the franchisees to sell.
The franchisees accounted to Allphones for the total sale proceeds.
Mr Donnellan explained to Mr Hoy that the Allphones model was different to other mobile phone franchising arrangements which were tied to particular carriers.
The Allphones model gave it, as franchisor, and its franchisees, access to a broad range of various carriers' plants and specials whenever they were available.
Thus, when customers were in an Allphones shop, they could be offered the current plans and specials of whichever carrier or carriers were on offer at the time.
Of course, the two men were discussing matters of some familiarity to them through their own involvements in the mobile phone industry over some years.
The critical area of discussion focused on how the Allphones model was different to a conventional single carrier shop with which Mr Hoy was used to dealing.
Neither Mr Hoy nor Mr Donnellan suggested that they discussed Mr Hoy's potential territory at that first meeting.
Usually, the sale of a mobile phone would be accompanied by some arrangement with a carrier for the provision of telecommunication services, though this was not always the case.
Sometimes the customer would enter into a contract or plan for a number of months or years with a carrier under which the customer would acquire a mobile phone for either no charge to the customer directly, or for a charge that was discounted from what the phone might otherwise be sold for were it offered separately or on another deal by that, or a rival, carrier.
These sales were called post-paid phone sales.
That is because the payment for the phone generally was made as part of the overall payment by the customer to the carrier over the time of the plan.
As between Allphones and the carrier, the carrier would pay Allphones a commission for the sale of the phone at the franchised store, and further commissions over the term of the contract based on the customer's use of the carriers' network when making phone calls.
Thus, when a post-paid phone was sold, the franchisor and the franchisee could look forward to an income stream from the sale, based on the customer's usage of the phone over the term of the contractor plan.
On other occasions, customers purchased pre-paid phones.
These were phones in which the carrier had placed a pre-paid card allowing calls to be made up to the limit of the card.
When the customer had used all the credit on the card, he or she could return to a vendor of cards, including an Allphones store, and buy a recharge card for use of that carrier's network, or, if new arrangements were made, with another carrier.
In that way a customer could continue to top up the amount of available credit for use on the phone.
Sometimes, carriers offered locked phones as part of a pre-paid deal.
A 'locked' phone was one that could only be used on the particular carrier's network and the customer would have to continue buying recharge cards for that carrier to utilise the phone.
Locked phones were sold at a price discounted from that for which a similar phone, not locked to a carrier's network, would be sold in the stores.
At the end of the meeting, Mr Hoy said that Mr Donnellan gave him an Allphones disclosure document prepared for the purposes of the Code.
Mr Hoy said that in early 2004, after the franchise agreement had been entered into, he threw the disclosure document away.
It is not possible to make any finding about what the exact contents of the disclosure document were, since neither party now has a copy of it.
Sometime after their initial meeting, Mr Donnellan sent Mr Hoy an email on 23 October 2002 saying that because he had heard nothing further, he assumed Mr Hoy had decided not to go ahead with the franchise, but he would leave the door open for continued discussions.
Mr Hoy telephoned Mr Donnellan later that day and discussed matters.
Following that discussion Mr Hoy sent an email which, among other things, mentioned that he had forgotten to clarify how 'co-op' payments for shop fit out provided by telecommunications carriers were dealt with in Allphones franchises.
('Co-op' fit out payments were sometimes made by carriers to franchisors as part of their advertising or promotional expenditure.
The carriers benefited by ensuring that the get-up associated with their brand and goodwill was inside the franchise shop.
Customers would be attracted to that carrier's product and services by a ready identification of the brand and associated get-up.
) Mr Donnellan emailed back to Mr Hoy on 24 October 2002 saying that the whole amount received by Allphones from the carriers for co-op fit out was passed on by Allphones to the franchisee.
He said that for the previous two franchises, the total amount paid for co-op payments for fit out had been $18,000 and '... [w]e will try to maintain or increase this.
The carriers are slow payers'.
Mr Donnellan explained in giving evidence that it had been in the carriers' financial interests to support Allphones' initial attempts in 2002 to penetrate markets in different States, through co-op payments to assist with store fit outs.
As events turned out, the policies of the various carriers, who were highly competitive with one another, changed and co-op funds ceased to be used for this purpose before June 2003 when the franchise agreement was ultimately entered into between Allphones and Hoy Mobile.
Thus, there were no monies paid by any of the carriers to Allphones for shop fit out which could have been passed on to Hoy Mobile.
However, Mr Donnellan failed to pass on to Mr Hoy the information that the carriers' policies had changed.
And also because no fresh disclosure document was given to him by Allphones at the time of entering into the franchise agreement, Mr Hoy was not aware of the change of position.
That was an oversight by Mr Donnellan and a contravention of cl 10 of the Code.
However, Mr Hoy did not give evidence that if he had been informed of the true position, he would have acted any differently in his decision to go ahead.
I find that Allphones' contravention of cl 10 of the Code and its failure to inform Hoy Mobile, at the time of entering into the franchise agreement, that no co-op payments were likely to be available to assist in defraying the cost of fitting out its store would have made no difference to Hoy Mobile's decision to enter into the franchise agreement.
Some further discussions occurred between Mr Hoy and Mr Donnellan.
Critically, on 8 November 2002 Mr Donnellan had his secretary send to Mr Hoy, by email, a copy of a franchise agreement between Allphones and a company called China Lake Holdings Pty Limited for the Castle Hill Allphones franchise.
The territory was described in item 14 of the schedule to that franchise agreement as 'Castle Hill, NSW'.
The area of restraint against competition was described in the same terms (in item 10).
The China Lake agreement also contained an Annexure A, which had a covenant against competition within an area of a circle having a radius of 25 km from the location of the shop in Castle Hill.
The email attaching the copy of the China Lake franchise agreement is the only contemporaneous document which described a territory of which both Allphones and Hoy Mobile had knowledge prior to then entering into their own franchise agreement.
On Monday 11 November 2002, Mr Donnellan sent an email to Mr Hoy.
He referred to their having caught up on the preceding Friday and wrote: '[G]lad to have you on board'.
I infer that after Mr Hoy received the China Lake franchise agreement, he considered its terms and then spoke to Mr Donnellan advising him that he would take up the opportunity to have a franchise agreement with Allphones.
The two men had been discussing the fact that Mr Hoy wished to have more than one franchise.
He also wanted to have a discount on the franchise fee payable on entry into the arrangements.
At some point, probably around early November 2002, Mr Donnellan wrote to Mr Hoy informing him that Allphones operated a franchise model, and thus could not vary any terms concerning the split of gross profits or anything else which was inconsistent with the model.
Neither party has retained the original or a copy of that letter.
I infer that their letter was in similar terms to Allphones' letter to Hoy Mobile dated 27 June 2003.
In that letter, Mr Donnellan said that it was not intended to disadvantage or advantage any particular franchisee over another and that Mr Hoy needed to understand and respect this position.
Mr Donnellan pointed out that because Allphones took the stock risk, by retaining title to the stock which was supplied to franchisees, as the franchise business became more successful the lower its risk became.
He then said that he appreciated that Mr Hoy was 'not a one-franchise person' and made an offer that, for the first franchise, the fee would be $35,000, of which only $25,000 would be payable upfront.
The letter continued: 
 
 'If within that franchise you achieve either 800 connections or $600,000 in sales in your first 12 months, the final $10,000 will be waived.
This is conditional on you agreeing to join the programme in 2002.
' (emphasis in original) 
 

 Mr Donnellan's letter repeated the same offer for the second and third franchises with two differences.
First, the upfront payment would be $20,000 with a further $15,000 payable for each of the two franchises, only if the relevant targets were not met.
Secondly, the second franchise was to commence trading no later than 12 months after the first had commenced, and the third no later than 16 months after the first.
Mr Donnellan said that it had been difficult to get concessions from the directors, but that he had persuaded them on the basis of his firm belief that Mr Hoy would be successful.
In his email on 11 November 2002, Mr Donnellan updated Mr Hoy on three potential sites that they had been discussing.
One of them was Eastgardens, where he said that Allphones had identified two sites but that the rents 'are stupid'.
He said that there was one particular site which might become available in the first quarter of 2003.
He asked for a payment of a deposit of $3,500 to ensure that Mr Hoy had the right of first refusal as the first of the various sites came up.
(There is no evidence that Mr Hoy paid that money.
) Mr Donnellan also said in that email that if Mr Hoy was prepared 'to take a site in a smaller centre --- and I respect that you are unlikely to do so --- then we would grant you first right at all of these sites until you took one' (sic).
Matters then moved a little slowly, but by 10 March 2003, Mr Hoy had prepared a two year forecast of the results he anticipated to achieve in trading as an Allphones franchisee and discussed it with Mr Donnellan.
The forecast provided for trading to commence in August 2003.
Mr Hoy sent the forecast to Mr Donnellan by email and sought some further information which both had discussed.
Mr Donnellan replied on 3 April 2003.
He said that he would give particular figures later that week.
However, he provided indicative figures for the four operating stores that Mr Hoy had enquired about and the dates on which they opened.
He commented on Mr Hoy's projections, noting that the projected sales figure of $60,000 per month would make Eastgardens the store with the second lowest turnover in New South Wales.
I infer that by early March 2003 Eastgardens had been selected as the location of Mr Hoy's franchise.
Mr Donnellan also mentioned that the fit out cost of $115,500 in Mr Hoy's projection appeared to be 'light' and that he had no idea how it had been estimated.
He said that gross profit over the past 12 months had been 26%.
This was an important calculation because it was used, as will appear, in the calculation of commissions payable by Allphones to its franchisees.
By Monday 23 June 2003 discussions had proceeded to the point where Mr Hoy and Mr Donnellan were exchanging emails finalising the terms of the intended franchise agreement.
On that day Mr Hoy sent an email which attached a copy of Mr Donnellan's 11 November 2002 email and, what I infer was a copy of the letter of offer for the three franchises to which I have referred above.
He said that that copy needed to be added to the franchise agreement, but the time frames in it would have to be adjusted to fit in with the date of the first lease.
Mr Donnellan emailed back on 26 June stating that he did not think that this needed to be in the agreement but that he stood by the offer which was binding.
In the morning of 27 June, Mr Hoy responded by email saying that he was happy to rely on the letter, however its spirit was to allow for a number of months between the opening of the various stores, while the agreement said that the second store had to be opened in 2003 and the third by March 2004.
He asked Mr Donnellan to confirm that the time frames would be moved so that the second store could be opened by August 2004 and the third by December 2004 to coincide with the late opening of the Eastgardens store.
Mr Donnellan immediately replied saying that his secretary would write a new letter reflecting the changed date.
In fact, on that day Mr Donnellan's secretary created a letter with the new times requested by Mr Hoy by cutting and pasting from an earlier version.
The letter of 27 June 2003 was made Attachment A to the franchise agreement.
It was signed by Mr Donnellan's secretary with his authority.
Mr Donnellan's secretary also created a written franchise agreement between Allphones and Hoy Mobile and dated it 27 June 2003.
The parties agreed that this document (which included the letter of 27 June 2003) reflected the written terms of their franchise agreement.
However, the version in evidence bears no signatures, other than Mr Donnellan's secretary's signature on the letter of 27 June 2003.
Mr Hoy said that he signed the original franchise agreement, and gave it to Mr Donnellan who signed it on behalf of Allphones.
Two copies were not signed, but kept by Mr Hoy.
Only Mr Donnellan had a copy of the agreement signed by both of them.
Subsequently, when Allphones moved its head office from Perth (where I infer the original signed franchise agreement had been sent) to Sydney it lost a number of documents including, I infer, the signed franchise agreement between it and Hoy Mobile.
In addition, at some stage, the hard drive of the computer used by Mr and Mrs Hoy crashed, and a number of documents, including emails between the parties, which it contained were lost.
Allphones never asked Mr Hoy or Hoy Mobile to provide it with a written statement that he or it had received, read or had a reasonable opportunity to understand the language of the disclosure document or the Code.
Hoy Mobile was never asked by Allphones to provide a signed statement that it had been given advice on the proposed franchise agreement by anyone, including a lawyer, or that it had been asked to seek advice on the proposed agreement by a lawyer or anyone else prescribed in cl 11(2) of the Code.
Allphones admitted that it had not complied with cll 10 and 11 of the Code before entering into the franchise agreement with Hoy Mobile.
Mrs Hoy said that she signed only one copy of the franchise agreement, and that she did so before her husband.
She did not recall whether she signed or initialled each page and only recalled signing the execution page.
She said that she did not recall looking at any particular part of the document.
She made an appointment for her husband to see a solicitor, Colin Duff, on 1 July 2007, but she did not attend the conference with him.
Mr Hoy recalled having had a discussion with Mr Duff concerning the proposed lease with Westfield, but he did not recall anything else.
He had no memory of discussing the franchise agreement with Mr Duff although he accepted it was possible that he did so.
While he said that he understood that he and his wife were giving a personal guarantee when they executed the franchise agreement, he claimed not to have put any weight on it.
He asserted that the discussion concerning the proposed lease took up nearly the entire meeting with Mr Duff.
Mr Duff gave evidence that his diary recorded that an appointment had been made for Mr Hoy to see him for the purpose of a certificate under s 16 of the Retail Leases Act 1994 (NSW) and thus, he said that the primary purpose of Mr Hoy's visit was to obtain such a certificate.
He gave a certificate under s 16 of the Retail Leases Act on that date for the leases that Hoy Mobile entered into with the lessors of the Eastgardens store.
Mr Duff had no independent recollection of the meeting, which is hardly surprising.
I am satisfied that his contemporaneous file note of his conference with Mr Hoy accurately recorded the substance of the general topics they discussed, and in limited respects, what he told Mr Hoy.
Mr Duff's file note commenced with the statement: 'Has gone into a franchise contract'.
This accorded with Mr Hoy's evidence that he had already left the signed franchise agreement with Mr Donnellan before he saw Mr Duff.
The file note recorded that Mr Hoy instructed Mr Duff that he intended, as part of the arrangements, to sign a lease.
It then recorded that Mr Duff dealt with a number of issues arising in respect of the three headings with brief descriptions underneath them, 'Queries re Lease', 'Franchise Agreement' and 'Family Trust'.
Under the heading 'Franchise Agreement' Mr Duff's note referred to cl 6.4(ii) of the franchise agreement and the amount of advertising being 5% or less of the net revenue.
He also noted that there was a restraint of trade, a guarantee and indemnity and also noted the 'effect of Annexure "A" as amending terms of agreement'.
I infer that the reference to 'Annexure "A"' referred to the letter dated 27 June 2003.
Mr Duff's notes included a second page with calculations of gross profit for the purposes of working out the net revenue of 26% retained by Allphones, of which up to 5% could be applied to advertising under cl 6.4(ii).
Mr Duff also explained issues relating to the family trust to Mr Hoy.
I find that Mr Hoy asked Mr Duff for, or received some explanations of, particular parts of the franchise agreement which he had previously signed and left with Allphones, rather than receiving advice generally for the purposes of cl 11(2) of the Code.
Although each of Mr Hoy and Mr Donnellan gave evidence as to what happened at various meetings between them, I have little confidence in their recollections of conversations which occurred over five years ago.
In Watson v Foxman (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318-319 McLelland CJ in Eq said: 
 
 'Where, in civil proceedings, a party alleges that the conduct of another was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive (which I will compendiously described as "misleading") within the meaning of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act ), it is ordinarily necessary for that party to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the court: (1) what the alleged conduct was; and (2) circumstances which rendered the conduct misleading.
Where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances.
In many cases (but not all) the question whether spoken words were misleading may depend upon what, if examined at the time, may have been seen to be relatively subtle nuances flowing from the use of one word, phrase or grammatical construction rather than another, or the presence or absence of some qualifying word or phrase, or condition.
Furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said.
All too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed.
All this is a matter of ordinary human experience.

 

 
 
 Each element of the cause of action must be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the court, which means that the court "must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence".
Such satisfaction is "not ... attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved" including the "seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding": Helton v Allen [1940] HCA 20 ; (1940) 63 CLR 691 at 712.

 

 
 
 Considerations of the above kinds can pose serious difficulties of proof for a party relying upon spoken words as the foundation of a causes of action based on s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (or s 42 of the Fair Trading Act ), in the absence of some reliable contemporaneous record or other satisfactory corroboration.
' 
 
 His Honour's observations as to the frailty of human memory are, of course, not to be taken as limited simply to cases invoking claims under the Trade Practices Act or its analogues.
They are just as apposite in a case such as this where the question arises of what oral terms of the contract were agreed in the course of negotiations.
2.
THE TERMS OF THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENT 
 The franchise agreement recited that Allphones had developed a system of doing business in association with its intellectual property and distinctive method and style for operating the franchised businesses.
Clauses 1 and 2 of the franchise agreement provided that Allphones had granted Hoy Mobile the right, and the latter accepted, the obligation to operate a franchise business: 
 
 'Right to conduct franchise 
 

 1.
... within the Territory referred to in the Schedule hereto (hereafter called "the Territory") in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 
 
 Exclusivity 
 

 The Franchisor must not itself operate or licence another to operate a Franchised Business in the Territory.
The Franchisee must not canvass sales outside of the Territory.
' 
 The franchise agreement was to commence in August 2003 and run for a period of five years with an option to renew for a further term of five years (cl 3).
Allphones was entitled to develop and change the system and intellectual property which it used in the conduct of its overall franchise business (cl 4).
Hoy Mobile, among other obligations, agreed not to do or permit anything during the term of the franchise agreement or thereafter which might detract from Allphones' reputation or goodwill or be misleading or deceptive or otherwise cause confusion (cl 5.8).
The franchise agreement provided that Allphones had sole and absolute discretions: Importantly, cl 6.5(ii) provided: 
 
 'Stock supplied by [Allphones] to [Hoy Mobile] in terms hereof is supplied on consignment, and at the cost of delivery of [Hoy Mobile], and shall at all times be subject to the control of Allphones Point-of-Sale and inventory computer system ...' (sic) 
 

 The Allphones point-of-sale and inventory computer system allowed each franchised store to enter product sales into a centralised data base.
Thus, when a credit card sale was made to a customer in a store, the point-of-sale system would allow the payment to be received immediately by Allphones.
Similarly, a cash sale was recorded by the system on the next working day and the franchisee would bank into Allphones' bank account the day's cash takings.
The system caused the store's electronic cash register receipts to be printed which recorded the goods sold and their prices (this was also the customer's sole receipt for a cash sale) and a credit card or EFTPOS transaction receipt.
The system recorded what stock each franchised store held on consignment and, as sales occurred, movements in that stock.
Thus, Allphones was able to know at any time what stock was held by a franchisee, what sales it had made and what monies had been received.
Title to the stock supplied to Hoy Mobile remained vested in Allphones until it received payment (cl 6.9).
Under the franchise agreement, Allphones also retained management control over all stock supplied by it to the franchised business and it was entitled, without notice, to recall any stock, or to move it to another franchised business or elsewhere (cl 6.5(iii)).
Allphones had the right to conduct stock audits on a minimum of 72 hours' notice during normal business hours (cl 6.46).
Hoy Mobile was only permitted to make available, for sale or distribution at the franchise business, products that complied with Allphones' standards or specifications or which it had approved in writing.
In general terms, Hoy Mobile was required to order its stock from Allphones and the latter had to supply that stock.
Hoy Mobile had to offer for sale at its store the products or services specified by Allphones unless their sale would be contrary to law.
And, Hoy Mobile was not permitted to limit its business to a portion only of the products or services authorised by Allphones (cl 6.5(i)).
This requirement also applied to stock Hoy Mobile desired to sell which was not usually supplied to franchised businesses by Allphones.
If Allphones decided not to supply such stock, it had to notify Hoy Mobile within 48 hours of the order (cll 6.5-6.7) in which case Hoy Mobile was free to obtain the stock elsewhere.
However, if Hoy Mobile did so, it was not to use the point-of-sale system to record sales of that stock, and they were not to be made under the name 'Allphones' (cl 6.8).
The total value of Allphones' stock held by Hoy Mobile was not to exceed $30,000 or a value equal to an average of 45 days of its product sales.
However, Allphones had a discretion to allow Hoy Mobile to hold a greater value of stock (cl 6.14).
Hoy Mobile had to operate the franchised business strictly in accordance with the standards and specifications contained in the Allphones operations manual, and other instructions provided by Allphones from time to time (cl 6.23).
Hoy Mobile was not allowed to conduct any other business than the franchised business on or from the franchised premises (cl 6.24).
The franchise agreement contained detailed provisions for the selection of a site at which the franchised business would be developed and operated (cl 6.28).
Allphones could specify the criteria for site selection from time to time.
Hoy Mobile was prohibited from doing anything which would tend to dishonour, discredit or damage Allphones' reputation or that of other franchisees or its system or image.
In particular Hoy Mobile had to be guided by the highest standards of honesty, integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct in all its dealings with members of the public (cl 6.34(ii)).
Importantly, Hoy Mobile agreed that it would promote only directly its sales activities in the territory and Allphones covenanted that neither it nor any related body would grant to any person a licence to use the system within the territory without Hoy Mobile's prior consent (cl 6.45).
Allphones had the sole right to determine the recommended sale price of each item of stock.
That price would be set in the point-of-sale system.
Hoy Mobile could discount the price for good reason, including to remain competitive, but, if it did so, it would bear any loss on the discounted sale price (cl 7.1).
Importantly, cl 7.2 provided: 
 
 '[Hoy Mobile] undertakes to issue all invoices and receipts for stock and services sold by it under the name of [Allphones] and acknowledges that, for the most part, the Allphones Point-of-Sale and inventory computer system will produce these invoices and/or receipts.
' 
 

 All monies received by Hoy Mobile in relation to the sale of stock or services supplied by Allphones had to be deposited into a nominated bank account of Allphones daily where possible and, in any event, no later than the next business day after receipt.
Allphones was required to bear all bank charges in relation to those deposits (cl 7.3(i)).
Allphones had to transfer to Hoy Mobile, not later than monthly, an amount equivalent to 74% of the gross profit from the total monies received by Allphones under cl 7.3(i).
The gross profit was to be calculated in accordance with cl 7.5.
Hoy Mobile had to bear all costs and bank charges relating to a transfer to it of that money (cl 7.3(ii)).
Allphones was given the right to delay such payments if Hoy Mobile was in breach of any term of the franchise agreement (cl 7.3(iii)).
Next, cl 7.4 provided: 
 
 '7.4(i) All moneys received by the Franchisee [sic] in relation to mobile telephone sales commission ("MTSC") and mobile telephone airtime commission ("MTAC") shall be promptly deposited into such bank account of [Allphones] as may be notified in writing by [Allphones] from time to time.
... 
 

 
 
 (ii) [Allphones] shall on the 15 th day of each calender month, or if this shall not be a business day then the business day thereafter, transfer to [Hoy Mobile] by way of cheque or electronic funds transfer to such bank account as [Hoy Mobile] may notify [Allphones] in writing from time to time moneys equivalent to [72.5%] ... of the MTSC and the MTAC from the total moneys received by [Allphones] pursuant to clause 7.4(i), and [Hoy Mobile] shall bear all costs and bank charges relating to such transfers.
' (emphasis added) 
 

 Gross profit was calculated for the purposes of cll 7.3 and 7.4 by deducting the actual cost of goods sold, the actual cost of freight to the franchised premises and credit charges (including all government duties and charges) from Hoy Mobile's receipts from sales of stock supplied by Allphones (cl 7.5(i)).
'MTSC' was 'defined as income received from the mobile telephone networks ... in respect of the activation of a mobile telephone customer to the networks'.
The carriers at the date of the franchise agreement were also identified.
'MTAC' was 'defined as the income received from the mobile telephone networks ... relating to the proportion of call revenue received by the networks that is payable to [Allphones] in accordance with its agreements with the networks' (cl 7.5(ii) and (iii)).
While cl 7.4(i) referred to monies 'received by the Franchisee' (here, Hoy Mobile) in relation to MTSC and MTAC, it was common ground that the carriers had always paid Allphones those commissions.
I accept Mr Donnellan's evidence that the money which Allphones received from the carriers in respect of those commissions was dealt with as if Allphones had received it from the franchisee in accordance with cl 7.4.
He said, in effect, that if a telephone service had been activated through a sale made at an Allphones store, such as that of Hoy Mobile, Allphones was bound to pay the MTSC and MTAC it received from the carrier in respect of that activation to the relevant franchisee.
He said that Allphones was obliged to account to the franchisee for that commission, in accordance with the terms of cl 7.4.
This understanding expressed by Mr Donnellan reflects the way in which cl 7.4 should be construed in order to give it the commercial effect the parties must have intended.
They both knew that MTSC and MTAC were significant rewards for the sales efforts of franchisees and that the franchisees were intended to receive the shares of commission for MTSC and MTAC provided in cl 7.4 however the carriers might pay those sums.
No other provisions in the franchise agreement would have enabled a franchisee to benefit from MTSC and MTAC which was paid to Allphones directly by the carriers in respect of sales effected by the franchisee which generated such commission.
Of course, in the unlikely event that the franchisee received either form of commission directly from the carrier, it would have had to account for it in accordance with cl 7.4.
But the commonsense business understanding expressed by Mr Donnellan reflected the commercial reality that the two types of commission in cl 7.4 were very significant sources of earnings of a franchise business.
The inelegantly drawn provisions of cl 7.4 were intended to divide any MTSC and MTAC paid by a carrier to either a franchisee or Allphones, between the two parties to the franchise agreement.
Importantly in light of the way in which Mr Hoy later acted as explained below, cl 7.6 required Hoy Mobile to sell all stock either by way of cash, cheque, electronic funds transfer or credit card.
And, Hoy Mobile had to supply Allphones with a copy of each invoice, together with a deposit slip relating to that invoice, for the sale of stock supplied by Allphones (cl 7.9(ii)).
Hoy Mobile also had to keep and maintain records, accounts, books and data which accurately reflected all particulars relating to the franchised business (cl 7.12).
Allphones was entitled to have its representatives or agents inspect the franchise premises and ensure that its standard get-up requirements were met (cl 7.17).
Hoy Mobile covenanted against competing with Allphones for the ensuing six months following the termination of the franchise agreement (cl 7.22).
The area of restraint was specified as 'the Territory' or, alternatively the area 'within a circle having a radius' of 25 km from the franchised business or any other franchised business (cl 7.22).
Allphones formally elected not to seek to enforce this restraint in the event that it terminated the franchise agreement.
This makes it unnecessary to determine the validity of the restraints or whether Hoy Mobile should be granted any relief in respect of the restraints.
Allphones could not unreasonably withhold its consent to an assignment by Hoy Mobile of the benefit of the franchise agreement, provided, that among other things, Hoy Mobile was not in breach and had paid all monies due (cl 8.1(ii)).
However, if Hoy Mobile wished to sell its rights under the franchise agreement, Allphones had a right of first refusal on the terms of the proposed sale (cl 8.3).
Rights of termination were provided in cl 9.
If Hoy Mobile failed to perform an obligation in circumstances where the default was capable of being rectified, Allphones could give notice requiring rectification within 30 days, failing which it could terminate.
However, if Hoy Mobile had committed a breach of an obligation under the franchise agreement which was not capable of rectification, Allphones was entitled to terminate by notice in writing without requiring rectification of the breach (cl 9.1).
Allphones was also entitled to terminate the agreement by giving written notice to Hoy Mobile on the occurrence of a number of events of default, including if Hoy Mobile misused or permitted misuse of Allphones' intellectual property or did any other act which harmed Allphones' goodwill and reputation and it failed to remedy that default within 24 hours' notice (cl 9.2(iii)).
In addition, Allphones was entitled to terminate the franchise agreement immediately and without notice to Hoy Mobile upon the occurrence of a number of events of default including, significantly: 
 
 '9.3 ... 
 (viii) [Hoy Mobile] is fraudulent in connection with the operation of the Franchised Business.
' 
 

 
The right of termination in cl 9.3(viii) reflected the provisions of cl 23(f) of the Code.
The latter provision also permitted a franchisor to terminate without notice where the franchisee was fraudulent in connection with the operation of the franchised business.
The rights under cll 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 were expressed to be in addition to any other remedies of Allphones and, cl 9.4 went on to provide: 
 
 '... the election not to terminate shall not constitute a waiver by [Allphones] of its rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement.
' 
 

 Allphones had the right to purchase Hoy Mobile's assets at a price fixed by a valuer within 30 days of termination (cl 11).
The franchise agreement expressly provided that the business of Hoy Mobile was independent from the business of Allphones and that there was no agency, partnership or joint venture between them (cl 12).
Importantly, cl 15 provided that the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement could not be modified, altered or amended except by written agreement of both parties.
And, cl 16 provided that any waiver or partial waiver of any of Allphones' powers, rights or remedies under the franchise agreement would not be effective unless made in writing and signed by Allphones.
In addition, a failure or delay on the part of Allphones to exercise a right or remedy would not operate as a waiver, nor would any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise by it of any other right or remedy under the franchise agreement (cll 16.1, 16.2).
The franchise agreement recorded that it constituted the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and superseded all prior negotiations, representations or agreements, whether written or oral (cl 18).
A dispute resolution mechanism was provided in cl 24.1.
That provided that if a dispute arose between the parties they agreed to undertake and implement steps in accordance with Pt 4 of the Code.
If the matter could not be resolved, they agreed to refer the matter to the mediation adviser appointed by the Franchising Policy Council (cl 24.2).
A number of definitions were set out in cl 26.
The franchised premises were defined to mean 'premises from which the Franchised Business is conducted', being the business conducted in the terms of the franchise agreement.
And, 'outlet' was defined as 'all Franchised Businesses operating within the Territory' (cl 26.1).
Significantly, the Code was deemed to be incorporated in the franchising agreement '... and in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Code then the provisions of the Code shall prevail' (cl 28).
In the schedule to the franchise agreement: the franchised premises were stated to be: 
 
 'Shop 104, Westfield Eastgardens 
 152 Bunnerong Road 
 Eastgardens NSW 2036' 
 

 A covenant against competition was Annexure A to the franchise agreement.
It was in terms similar to those in the China Lake agreement, providing for the area of restraint to be a circle having a radius of 25 km from the GPO (presumably the General Post Office in Sydney).
There was also Attachment A to the franchise agreement being the letter dated 27 June 2003.

WHAT WAS THE TERRITORY?

 3.1 Hoy Mobile's evidence regarding territory
 Mr Hoy said that following his first meeting with Mr Donnellan he discussed matters with his wife.
He also said he went through the disclosure document and then had a second meeting in about September 2002 with Mr Donnellan at Allphones' office.
He said that at the second meeting Mr Donnellan began the conversation saying: 'We offer 5 km territories'.
Mr Hoy said that he asked whether that was diameter or radius, and Mr Donnellan enquired what the difference was.
