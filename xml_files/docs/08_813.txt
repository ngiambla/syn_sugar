 
1 This afternoon judgment has been published in SZJDI v Minister for Immigration  Citizenship [2008] FCA 685.
Order 2 of the Orders made today is an order that the appellant shall pay the costs of the first respondent of and incidental to the appeal.
I have before me an application by the first respondent for an order that the costs the subject of Order 2 be fixed in an amount of $2,700.00.
The application is supported by an affidavit of Mr Peter Snell a solicitor employed by Sparke Helmore Lawyers, the solicitors for the first respondent.
The affidavit deposes to the sequence of steps involved in preparing and responding to the appeal.
The affidavit of Mr Snell identifies an estimate of the party and party costs the first respondent would be entitled to recover on taxation in accordance with 'Schedule 2 --- scale of costs for work done and services performed' in accordance with the Federal Court Rules .
Having regard to Mr Snell's affidavit, I am satisfied that an amount of $2,700.00 properly represents a discounted amount of the party and party costs the first respondent might otherwise be entitled to recover upon taxation.
Accordingly, I make a further order that the costs of the first respondent the subject of Order 2 made today described above be fixed in the amount of $2,700.00.
I certify that the preceding one (1) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.
