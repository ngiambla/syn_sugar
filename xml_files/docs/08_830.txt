 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant (Dr Thoo) applies under ss 5 and 6 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) and s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) for review of a series of decisions which culminated in a decision by the first respondents (Committee), on 29 June 2007 that Dr Thoo, a general medical practitioner, had engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with providing certain services.
2 As a result of orders previously made for the trial of separate questions, the only issue before the Court to which these reasons relate is Dr Thoo's challenge on administrative law grounds to the Committee's decision.
Accordingly, of the respondents, only the Committee has appeared on the hearing.
3 Dr Thoo relies on two grounds.
First, he contends that the Committee inquired into, and made its finding in respect of, services lying outside those in respect of which it was by law authorised to make any inquiry or decision.
The second ground relates to a hearing before the Committee on 3 February 2006.
Dr Thoo contends that on that day the Committee denied him procedural fairness, in particular, by refusing his request for an adjournment of the hearing.
Associated with that refusal, Dr Thoo complains that the Committee received submissions and/or advice from the Committee's legal or other advisors in the course of the hearing but in the absence of Dr Thoo; that the Committee continued the hearing after he had left; and that the Committee failed to provide him with a copy of any record of the deliberations that took place in his absence.
Dr Thoo does not press a complaint that the Committee received evidence in his absence at that hearing.
LEGISLATION 
 
4 I have found helpful both parties' submissions in relation to the scheme of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) (the Act) and the background to the Act.
For convenience, I adopt the following account from the submissions of Ms Henderson, counsel for the Committee (footnotes in her original submissions are shown within square brackets):
 THE LEGISLATION 
 
 3.
The relevant legislation is the Health Insurance Act 1973 ("the Act ") as amended, up to and including the amendments made by the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review and other matters) Act 2002 .
4.
Section 10 of the Act provides for the payment of medical benefits to an eligible person who incurs medical expenses for a professional service rendered in Australia.
[The expressions "eligible person" and "professional service" are defined in s 3.
] Section 20A permits a person to assign his or her medical benefit to the practitioner who rendered the service, on the basis that the medical benefit is accepted as full payment of the medical expenses; this is known as " bulk billing .
"
 
 5.
Part VAA of the Act [Part VAA was inserted by the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 .
] provides for review of the provision of services by a medical practitioner to determine whether he or she has engaged in " inappropriate practice ," as defined in s 82.
Inappropriate practice means conduct that would be unacceptable to the general body of the medical practitioner's peers.
6.
The review scheme created by Part VAA involves four independent entities/persons:
 
 
6.1 The entity that pays medical benefits --- previously the Health Insurance Commission, and from 1 October 2005 Medicare Australia.
This entity initiates the review process by making a request to the Director of Professional Services Review (s 86).

 
 
 
6.2 The Director of Professional Services Review, a medical practitioner appointed to that position under s 83.
On receiving a request, the Director decides whether to undertake a review (s 88A) and determines, relevantly, whether to set up a Professional Services Review Committee to investigate whether a practitioner has engaged in inappropriate practice (s 93).
The Director makes a referral to a Committee (s 93).
6.3 A Professional Services Review Committee, consisting of a Deputy Director of Professional Services Review and two other practitioners [see ss 84 and 85.
The Deputy Directors and the other Committee members are drawn from a Panel appointed by the Minister after consultation with relevant organisations and associations.
] who practice in the same profession as the practitioner under review (ss 95(1) and 95(2)).
The Committee conducts hearings (s 101), prepares a draft report on which the practitioner is invited to make submissions (s106KD) and makes a final report on whether the practitioner engaged in appropriate practice (s 106L).
If the final report contains a finding of inappropriate practice, copies of it must be given to the practitioner, the Director and - after 1 month --- to the Determining Authority (s 106L).
6.4 The Determining Authority established under s 106Q.
If the final report contains a finding of inappropriate practice, the Determining Authority must prepare a draft determination containing one or more of the directions in s 106U (s 106T).
After the medical practitioner has been given the opportunity to make submissions on the draft determination, the Determining Authority makes a final determination (s 106TA).

 
 
 7.
While the scheme involves discipline of practitioners, that is not its primary focus.
After a comprehensive review of relevant decisions in Grey [ Health Insurance Commission v Grey [2002] FCAFC 130 ; (2002) 120 FCR 470 at [173] ] the Full Court noted consensus in the Court's judgments in relation to various matters, including the following proposition: 
 
 
 
 
 Although disciplinary powers are conferred under the legislative scheme, the purpose or object of the statute is to protect both patients and the Commonwealth against abuse of the system.
That is to say, as "public protective" legislation, Parts VAA and VA should not be narrowly interpreted.

 
 
 PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE REVIEW SCHEME 
 
 8.
The Act has always contained provisions for the review of professional services for which medical benefits were paid or payable.
It originally provided that the Minister could refer to a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry " any matter ... relevant to the operation or administration of [the] Act .
" The Committee would investigate the matter and report back to the Minister, with a recommendation as to the determination the Minister should make.
9.
A new scheme --- the 1994 scheme --- was introduced on 1 July 1994.
[ Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 ] It was reviewed and amended after the Court's decisions in Yung [ Yung v Adams (1997) 80 FCR 453 , Adams v Yung (1998) 83 FCR 248] , and an amended version --- the 1997 scheme --- commenced on 6 November 1997.
[ Health Insurance Amendment Act (No 1) 1997 ] Further amendments were made in 1999 to give effect to recommendations made in the Report of the Review Committee of the Professional Services Review Scheme --- the 1999 scheme .
Most of those amendments came into operation on 16 July 1999.
[ Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Act 1999 .
] 
 
 
 
 10.
After Finn J found in Pradhan [ Pradhan v Holmes [2001] FCA 1560 ; (2001) 125 FCR 280] that the 1999 amendments had not achieved their purpose, the Act was further amended in 2002.
The amended version --- the 2003 scheme --- commenced on 1 January 2003.
[ Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review and Other Matters) Act 2002 ] 
 
 
 
 
 The Federal Court considered [the 1999] amendments in Pradhan v Holmes  Ors and made findings, which suggested the amendments may not have had the effect intended by the Review Committee.
The proposed amendments address certain issues identified by the Federal Court and clarify the intended operation of the Scheme as envisaged by the recommendations of the Review Committee.
[ Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review and other matters) Bill 2002 Explanatory Memorandum page 2]
 
 
 
 
 
 11.
The Court held in Yung and Pradhan that the Committee's role is to investigate conduct by the practitioner that has been specified by either the Commission (Yung) [ Yung at 299B] or by the Commission and the Director ( Pradhan ).
[ Pradhan at [126]] The Yung and Pradhan judgments were subjected to careful analysis by a Full Court in Grey .
[ Grey 120 FCR at [178] to [187]] The Court " [did] not accept that a referral is to be framed as a charge or indictment ".
[ Grey 120 FCR at [179]] It concluded that at the stage when a matter is referred to a Committee " the whole matter rests in inquiry, rather than charge .
" [ Grey 120 FCR at [182]]
 
 12.
The 2002 amendments included the removal of references to " conduct " which had previously appeared in provisions that had assumed particular significance in Yung and Pradhan .
[See in particular Pradhan at [127]] 
 
 SECTION 106KA --- THE "80/20 RULE" 
 
 13.
Section 106KA(1) [Section 106KA was inserted into the Act to give effect to certain recommendations made in the March 1999 Report of the Review Committee of the Professional Services Review Scheme ] of the Act deems inappropriate practice to have occurred in certain circumstances.
It provides that a practitioner " is taken ... to have engaged in inappropriate practice " during a particular period if the circumstances in which some or all of the services were rendered or initiated [Initiation of a service, for the purposes of the Act, means referring a patient to another practitioner, for example for an xray or a specialist opinion] constituted " a prescribed pattern of services ".
In the case of general practitioners, rendering 80 or more services on 20 or more days during a 12-month period constitutes a prescribed pattern of services.
[See reg 10 of the Regulations, made pursuant to s 106KA(3) of the HI Act.
] The combined operation of s 106KA(1) and reg 10 has become known as " the 80/20 rule ".
14.
The deeming effect of s 106KA(1) is displaced if the general practitioner satisfies the Committee that " exceptional circumstances " affected the rendering of the services on a particular day or days.

 
 MBS ITEM NUMBERS 
 
 15.
Section 4 of the Act provides that regulations made under the Act may provide for a general medical services table that sets out medical services items, the fees payable for each item, and rules for the interpretation of the table.
The regulations cease to be in force 12 months after they are made.
16.
The expression " MBS item number " refers to an item in the medical benefits schedule that forms part of the regulations made annually under s 4.
The Committee in the present case considered MBS item 23 and MBS item 36 services, which are --- summarising the provisions briefly - consultations at a doctor's surgery involving a specified level of medical complexity, lasting up to 20 minutes (MBS item 23) or up to 40 minutes (MBS item 36).
The full descriptors for the two items are included in the Glossary at the commencement of the Committee's final report.
[Thoo exhibit 4 ] 
 
 FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
5 During the period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003, Dr Thoo claimed medical benefits that had been assigned to him under s 20A of the Act.
6 On 23 December 2004, the third respondent, then the Health Insurance Commission (HIC), made a request to the fourth respondent, Dr AJ Holmes (the Director), for review in respect of Dr Thoo in relation to all services rendered by him during the "review period", 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003.
7 By letter dated 10 January 2005, the Director advised Dr Thoo that he had decided to undertake a review.
The letter stated:
 I consider the Commission's statistical data shows there is credible evidence that you have provided 80 or more professional attendances on 20 or more days within a 12 month period.
If confirmed, this may constitute a prescribed pattern of services which is taken under the Act, subject to accepted evidence of exceptional circumstances, to constitute engaging in inappropriate practice.
At this stage I have no evidence of exceptional circumstances before me.
For that reason, a Committee established under the Act could, unless exceptional circumstances exist, reasonably conclude that you have engaged in inappropriate practice.
The "80/20 rule" was discussed at [4](13) above.
The Director's letter to Dr Thoo also stated:
 Following the review, I must decide whether to: 
 
 (a) take no further action in relation to the review (under section 91 of the Act), or 
 
 
 
 (b) provide you with a written report explaining why I have not decided to proceed under section 91 of the Act and invite you to make written submissions as to the action I should take in relation to the review.
The options that are then open to me at that stage of the process include: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) a decision to take no further action in relation to the review (section 91); or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) a decision to enter into an agreement with you (section 92); or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) a decision to refer the matter for investigation by a PSR Committee (section 93).

 
 
 
8 Dr Thoo supplied a written submission dated 14 January 2005 which was acknowledged by letter dated 20 January 2005 from a "Senior Review Officer".
9 By a letter dated 10 February 2005 the Director advised Dr Thoo that he had decided to establish a Professional Services Review Committee under s 93 of the Act and to refer to it the task of investigating whether Dr Thoo had engaged in inappropriate practice in providing the services specified in the referral.
10 The Director established the Committee and made a referral to it under an instrument executed by him on 4 February 2005 entitled "Establishment of Professional Services Review Committee No.
446 and Referral to that Committee" (the Instrument).
11 On 23 February 2005 the Committee met to consider the referral that had been made to it.
The Committee decided not to investigate whether the referred services constituted a prescribed pattern of services pursuant to s 106KA of the Act (see [4](13) above), but rather to have regard only to a sample of MBS Item 23 and MBS Item 36 services among the referred services.
12 By letter dated 30 March 2005 the Committee advised Dr Thoo of this decision, and enclosed a "Notice to Produce Documents or Give Information" requiring him to produce records for certain patients to whom he had rendered MBS Item 23 and MBS Item 36 services during the review period.
Dr Thoo produced records in response to the notice.
13 On 22 June 2005 the Committee met to examine the records that Dr Thoo had produced.
The Committee decided that a hearing was warranted.
14 The Committee conducted a hearing, at which Dr Thoo appeared unrepresented, on 31 August 2005, 18 November 2005 and 3 February 2006.
Dr Thoo was questioned by the Committee on the first two dates in relation to MBS Item 23 services and MBS Item 36 services he had provided.
15 On the third hearing date, after being refused an adjournment, Dr Thoo left the hearing.
He did not give evidence or make any submissions on that date.
I will discuss below the course of the hearing on 3 February 2006.
16 Subsequently, on 24 February 2006, a solicitor who had been engaged by Dr Thoo contacted the Committee and requested an opportunity to make submissions.
The Committee agreed to consider such submissions before preparing its draft report.
On 10 April 2006 the Committee received the solicitor's submissions.
Those submissions urged the Committee to make a formal finding that there was no evidence to support a breach of the 80/20 rule, to make no further inquiry into the provision of MBS Item 23 services and MBS Item 36 services and to prepare a draft report which did not contain any finding that Dr Thoo had engaged in inappropriate practice.
17 On 17 August 2006 the Committee forwarded its draft report to Dr Thoo.
By a letter dated 29 September 2006 his solicitors supplied written submissions on the draft report.
18 The Chair of the Committee, Dr Bernard Kelly, signed the Committee's final report on 29 June 2007, and a copy was sent to Dr Thoo's solicitors under cover of a letter dated 2 July 2007.
19 Dr Thoo filed his application for review in this Court on 6 August 2007.
20 The second respondent (the Determining Authority) has received a copy of the final report, and has undertaken to the Court to take no action in the matter pending the resolution of this proceeding.
FIRST GROUND OF REVIEW RELIED ON BY DR THOO 
 
21 The Instrument defined the "review period" as the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 and "specified services" as the services specified in para 3 of the Instrument.
Paragraph 3 was as follows:
 
 
 3.
I hereby make a referral to a Professional Services Review Committee No.
