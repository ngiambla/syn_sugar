 
1 This is an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory order of Jarrett FM dated 29 May 2008 pursuant to s 24(1)(d) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
The order of the Federal Magistrate was in the following terms:
 That the oral application for adjournment of the trial listed for one (1) day on Wednesday 4 June 2008 by the applicant is refused.
2 Because the order of Jarrett FM was interlocutory, leave to appeal from his Honour's decision is required to be given by this Court (s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act ).
3 The applicant was self-represented, however the respondent had legal representation.
Both parties are located in northern New South Wales.
The hearing before me this afternoon was conducted by telephone.
Background 
 
4 The application before the learned Federal Magistrate, filed on 11 December 2007, is currently listed for hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court at Lismore tomorrow.
In the substantive proceedings the applicant seeks the following orders pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth):
 
1.
A penalty imposed on the employer in accordance with s 665(a).
2.
Compensation in accordance with s 665(c).
3.
An apology in accordance with s 665(e).
5 In summary, the grounds for the application before his Honour are that the respondent failed to give notice or adequate notice of termination to the applicant pursuant to s 661 of the Workplace Relations Act , and that the respondent terminated the applicant's employment for reasons in s 659 of that Act.
6 The application before me arises from a hearing in these proceedings last Thursday 29 May 2008 before Jarrett FM, where the applicant sought an adjournment of the hearing listed for 4 June 2008.
Both parties appeared by telephone at that hearing.
