Subsequently he was deemed to be the holder of a Class BF transitional (permanent) visa, apparently because of legislature changes.
In May 2003 Mr Tapel was convicted in the District Court of New South Wales on three counts of sexual intercourse without consent and sentenced to three years imprisonment on each of the first two counts and four years on the third count.
2 On 30 April 2007 a notice of intention to consider cancellation of his visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) was sent to Mr Tapel at the Long Bay Correctional Complex.
The letter erroneously referred to Mr Tapel as being the holder of a "Visa Subclass (100) Spouse granted to you on 12/08/1994".
It advised that if the Minister or his delegate reasonably suspected that Mr Tapel did not pass the character test he had power to cancel Mr Tapel's visa but pointed out that the decision maker has a discretion not to exercise that power.
