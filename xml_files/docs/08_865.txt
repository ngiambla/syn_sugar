 
1 In the amended notice of motion before me filed 15 May 2008 Granitgard Pty Ltd, which is the applicant in the substantive proceedings and also the applicant in these proceedings ("the applicant"), has sought the following orders:
 
1.
That leave be granted to the applicant to issue subpoenas to:

seeking documents in accordance with the respective schedules annexed and marked "A".
2.
Pursuant to O 17 of the Federal Court Rules , that the applicant (through its legal representatives and experts) be permitted to attend at the premises of Vision Glass Recycling at 39 Colebard St, West Archerfield Qld 4110 to observe and record the manufacturing process for, to inspect the equipment used in that process and to take samples of, the crushed glass provided to Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd as Termiglass.

2 This matter was heard by me on 4 June 2008 and again on 10 June 2008.
At the conclusion of the hearing of 4 June 2008, it was clear that, from the perspective of both the applicant and Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ("the respondent"), the key issue was whether the Court was prepared to make the orders sought by the applicant in paras 2, 4 and 5 of the amended notice of motion.
