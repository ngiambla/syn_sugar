 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 By notice dated and filed on 11 April 2008, the respondent moves the Court for orders that:
 
(1) The proceeding be dismissed pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the FCA') on the basis that the applicant has no reasonable prospects of successfully prosecuting the proceedings.
(2) in the alternative, the Statement of Claim ('the SOC') filed on 22 February 2008 be struck out pursuant to O 11 r 16(a) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') on the basis that the pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action; and
 
(3) in the alternative, the SOC be struck out pursuant to O 11 r 16(b) of the Rules on the basis that the pleadings are embarrassing.
2 By letter dated 20 March 2008, the respondent's solicitors wrote to the applicant's solicitors requesting further and better particulars of the SOC and by letter dated 4 April 2007, the applicant's solicitors responded to that request.
The respondent submitted that the response to the request was inadequate, but illustrated the inherent inconsistencies in the SOC.
3 At the time this motion came on for hearing on 23 May 2008, the respondent had not filed its defence.
4 At the outset, it needs to be said that it does not take an over-zealous scrutiny of the SOC to come to an early conclusion that, as pleadings go, it leaves a good deal to be desired in both its form and content.
There are, as the respondent submitted, a number of inherent inconsistencies.
Poorly drafted pleadings can never be cured by the provision of particulars, no matter how comprehensive they might be.
SECTION 31A OF THE FCA 
 
5 Section 31A of the FCA relevantly provides:
 '(1) ... 
 
 
 (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.

 
 
 
 
 
 (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be:
 
 (a) hopeless; or
 (b) bound to fail;
 
 
 
 
 
 for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.

 
 
 
 
 (4) ...' 
 
 Principles of Construction 
 
6 Section 31A of the FCA was introduced effective 1 December 2005.
The legislative context by which it was introduced and its historical antecedents are touched on by Lindgren J in White Industries Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [55] --- [60].
I think it is fair to say that the standard which s 31A sets, relevantly in the case of subs (2), '... no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding ...', apart from the fact that it does not require the proceeding to be hopeless or bound to fail (see subs (3)), has not been settled by an appellate court; and the recent decision of a Full Court in Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Co of Australia Ltd [2008] FCAFC 60 did nothing to advance this cause.
I shall return to this case later in these reasons.
7 In Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 ; (2006) 236 ALR 720 , Rares J said at [42] --- [45]:
 '[42] I am of opinion that, properly construed, s 31A(2)(b) requires a person moving a motion for summary disposal (the moving party) to satisfy the court that there is no reasonable prospect of the party claiming relief (the plaintiff) successfully prosecuting the proceeding or the part of the proceeding in question.
Experience shows that there are cases which appear to be almost bound to fail yet they succeed.
As Dixon CJ once said (Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith v Scales [1962] HCA 19 ; (1962) 107 CLR 9 at 20; [1962] HCA 19 ; [1962] ALR 775 at 781): 
 
 "Experience of forensic contests should confirm the truth of the common saying that one story is good until another is told.
" 
 
 [43] Brennan CJ and McHugh J applied that observation in Jackamarra [v Krakover [1998] HCA 27 ; (1998) 195 CLR 516] at [9] to a situation which an appellate court was exercising a discretion to permit a further step to be taken in an appeal that had already been instituted.
Obviously, where there is a contested application under s 31A, both parties will be present to explain their case, but not in the context of a trial.
The procedure envisaged by s 31A is summary.
The concept of a party having "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding" has some similarity to the test at common law for determining whether a jury properly instructed could reach a verdict for the plaintiff.
That test was authoritatively stated by the Judicial Committee in Hocking v Bell [1947] UKPCHCA 1 ; (1947) 75 CLR 125 at 130---1; [1947] HCA 54 ; [1948] 1 ALR 85 at 87-8 (Hocking (1947)), approving the following statement from the dissenting judgment of Latham CJ (Hocking v Bell (1945) 71 CLR 430 at 441---2 (Hocking (1945))): 
 
 If there is evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff, unless that evidence is so negligible in character as to amount only to a scintilla, the judge should not direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, nor should the Full Court direct the entry of such a verdict.
The principle upon which the section is based is that it is for the jury to decide all questions of fact, and therefore to determine which witnesses should be believed in case of a conflict of testimony.
But there must be a real issue of fact to be decided, and if the evidence is all one way, so that only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, there is no function left for the jury to perform, so that the court may properly take the matter into its own hands as being a matter of law , and direct a verdict to be entered in accordance with the only evidence which is really presented in the case.
[Emphasis added] 
 
 See also Swain v Waverley Municipal Council (2005) 220 CLR 517 ; 213 ALR 249 ; [2005] HCA 4 at [9] per Gleeson CJ, [128]---[131] per Gummow J and [203], [208]---[209] per Kirby J; see also at [33]---[34] per McHugh J.
[44] In a case to which s 31A applies, where there is a real issue of fact to be decided in the sense identified in the above principle, and, possibly, where there is a real issue of law of a similar kind, it is obviously appropriate that the matter goes to trial.
And, one must be mindful that in Hocking (1945) at 487, Dixon J said that, in effect, every judge who had heard the matter (through four trials, two Full Court appeals and, to that point, the appeal to the High Court) would have formed the view that the plaintiff should have failed had they been able to decide the facts, yet the Privy Council restored the second jury verdict in her favour and so concluded the litigation.
This raises a very real question, as to what reasonable prospects are for present purposes.
[45] I am of opinion that in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s 31A, the court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where, in accordance with the principles in Hocking (1947), contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed.
As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination, I am of opinion that then, as a matter of law, at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s 31A.
Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable, the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorise a summary termination of the proceedings which s 31A envisages.
In moving the second reading of the bill introducing s 31A (the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005) the Attorney-General said that it strengthened ... "the power of the courts to deal with unmeritorious matters by broadening the grounds on which federal courts can summarily dispose of unsustainable cases".

8 The approach of Rares J in Boston Commercial was adopted by Jacobson J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd (in liq.
) (formerly Stanley Thompson Valuers Pty Ltd) [2006] FCA 1416 where his Honour said at [30] --- [33]:
 '[30] ...
The authorities relating to the proper construction and effect of s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act were exhaustively reviewed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1352 at [31] --- [48].
