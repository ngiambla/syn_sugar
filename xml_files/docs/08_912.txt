 
1 Inform Design and Construction Pty Ltd ("Inform") is a well-known designer and builder of high-quality project homes in Victoria.
The homes it designs and builds are targeted at the upper end of the volume housing market.
It builds around eighty homes a year.
While it provides a customised design service in addition to its project homes, it does so on only a limited basis.
It does not license its designs to be built by others.
2 Boutique Homes Melbourne Pty Ltd ("Boutique"), the respondent to this proceeding, is also a volume builder in the Victorian project home market.
3 Inform claims that Boutique, by the design and construction of its project homes, particularly a home known as the Villa View, substantially reproduced and therefore infringed Inform's copyright in the design of two of its project homes, the Urban and Seasons.
In the alternative, Inform claims that to the extent that the Villa View reproduced its Urban and Seasons designs, this constitutes misleading or deceptive conduct under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
I have appended to these reasons for judgment plans for the Seasons, marked "A", and the Villa View, marked "B", respectively.
4 Boutique admits all formal matters.
It concedes that Inform holds copyright in the Urban and Seasons designs and that that copyright subsists.
However, it denies any infringement of that copyright.
5 Put simply, Boutique contends that it created the Villa View design without reference to, or even knowledge of, the Urban or Seasons.
Moreover, it says that Inform is seeking impermissibly to protect merely "an idea" and not "the expression of that idea".
Finally, it maintains that it has not in any event reproduced "a substantial part" of the Urban or Seasons designs.
6 This means that there are three issues to determine.
The first is whether Boutique made use of any of Inform's designs or buildings to create the Villa View.
The second is whether, if it did, the Villa View reproduces a substantial part of the Urban and Seasons designs.
The third is whether, even if that be the case, that which Inform is seeking to protect is amenable to copyright protection.
THE EVIDENCE 
 
7 Since 1998, Inform has on occasion retained Mr Leon Meyer, an architect, to design a series of two-storey project homes.
These commenced with a design known as the Core and then developed progressively through the Urban (designed in May and June 2001 and opened as a display home in June 2002) and the Seasons (designed in 2002 and opened in April 2003).
Mr Meyer expressly assigned copyright in these three designs to Inform.
8 According to Mr Meyer, these designs share certain conceptual characteristics, the main element of which is a modern plan layout along a rectilinear spine with a central freestanding staircase.
Ground-level service areas, such as the kitchen, bathrooms and laundry, are collected around that staircase.
These service areas are referred to as "wet areas" by virtue of the fact that water spillage is likely to occur there on a regular basis.
Bedroom and living areas are located upstairs and, wherever possible, upstairs bathrooms are clustered as close to the staircase as practicable.
9 The evidence establishes that since their introduction, the Core, Urban and Seasons have been highly successful, selling well and receiving industry recognition.
In 1999 the Core was a finalist in a Housing Industry Association ("HIA") award for Victorian display home design.
In 2000 it was runner-up in the category of display homes selling for over $250,000.
In 2002 the Urban won the HIA's Victorian Display Home of the Year in the $300,000 and above category.
In 2003 it won the HIA's national awards for Display Home of the Year in the $250,000 and above category and the Australian Home of the Year, which is the association's highest award for housing.
In 2003-04 Seasons won the award for Best Victorian Display Home between $350,000 and $500,000.
10 These awards generated considerable publicity.
All three homes featured in various newspaper articles.
In addition, Inform promoted its homes extensively in newspapers and magazines and built and operated display homes.
There is no dispute about the fact that it has acquired a substantial reputation and goodwill in its designs.
Plainly, those designs are extremely valuable.
11 Inform claims that Boutique infringed its copyright in the building plans and buildings themselves.
It claims that Boutique, through the design and construction of its Villa View home, particularly a home known as the Villa View 4300, has substantially reproduced its Urban and Seasons designs.
12 The evidence establishes that the Villa View comes in three sizes: 33 squares, 36.5 squares and 43 squares.
Boutique admits to having designed and built a version of unspecified dimension in July 2004 and having designed and built a 43-square version (the Villa View 4300) at Wyndham Waters Estate, Truganina, in the outer western suburbs of Melbourne, in about April 2005.
Another Villa View 4300 with a modified design has been built in North Balwyn.
13 Despite Inform's objections, Boutique maintains its display home at Wyndham Waters.
Boutique has said that, unless restrained, it will continue to do so.
14 Boutique claims that the Villa View 4300 was independently conceived and designed without recourse to any of the Inform designs.
It argues that there was a clear evolution of design, which began with the creation in early 2001 of what was described as the Mawson Lakes house plan, a three-bedroom house designed by Villis Architects.
In April 2001 this house evolved into what became known as the Villa Grand 30, also a three-bedroom project home.
Then, in 2002, at the request of various customers for a four-bedroom home, this developed into the Villa Grand 35.
Finally, and in response to a further request for a modern display home at Waterways Estate, Boutique developed plans in July 2003 for what was described as the Contemporary Villa Grand, a Tuscan-style two-storey project home.
The Contemporary Villa Grand was the basis for Boutique's Villa View 4300.
15 Boutique denies any copying, conscious or otherwise, of the Urban and/or Seasons.
It says that the Villa View was conceived by one of its principals, Mr Vito Di Natale, working in conjunction with an independent contracted draftsman, Mr Goran Lazarovski, over several months.
According to Mr Di Natale, the design process then lay dormant for about nine months.
It was revived and ultimately completed in April 2004 by Mr Di Natale with the assistance of Mr Steven O'Dwyer, a draftsman who later left Boutique to join Inform.
The evidence suggests that Mr Dean Lemke, another former Boutique employee who also joined Inform, assisted as well.
16 Boutique's other principal and its managing director, Mr Raymond de Weerd, also insists that the Villa View was conceived, designed and built independently of any of the three Inform designs.
Mr Di Natale and Mr de Weerd claim that despite the extensive publicity given to the Urban and Seasons at about the time that the Villa View was being developed, they were unaware of any of the Inform designs.
17 Inform's case relies heavily upon the evidence of Mr Meyer and Mr Graham Wines, an architect retained to provide a report as to whether the Villa View was copied from any of the Inform homes.
18 It is necessary to focus upon the evidence of these two witnesses with regard to the similarities between Inform's Seasons and Boutique's Villa View 4300.
It is accepted that there are greater similarities between these two homes than between the Urban and the Villa View.
If Inform cannot establish that the Villa View 4300 was a copy of the Seasons, it almost certainly cannot show that it was a copy of the Urban.
19 Mr Meyer's evidence was that the Villa View shared a number of design elements with the Urban and the Seasons.
