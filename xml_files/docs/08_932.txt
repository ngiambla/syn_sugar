Subsequently I heard argument as to some aspects of the relief sought.
Declarations, certificates and injunctions 
 
2 The applicants (collectively B  D) seek, inter alia, the following orders:
 THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 1.
The Respondent has infringed claims 1 and 3 to 8 (inclusive) of Australian Standard Patent No.
757412 ("the Standard Patent") by exploiting in Australia the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No.
TRM50 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark I").
2.
The Respondent has infringed claims 1 to 6 (inclusive) of the Standard Patent by exploiting in Australia the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No.
TRM51 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark II").
3.
The Respondent has infringed claims 1 to 5 (inclusive) of Australian Innovation Patent No.
2002100583 ("the Innovation Patent") by exploiting in Australia the Tyrannosaw Mark I.
4.
The Respondent has infringed claims 1 to 5 (inclusive) of the Innovation Patent by exploiting in Australia the Tyrannosaw Mark II.
THE COURT CERTIFIES THAT: 5.
For the purposes of s 19 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth), the validity of claims 1 to 8 of the Standard Patent was questioned unsuccessfully in these proceedings.
6.
For the purposes of s 19 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth), the validity of claims 1 to 5 of the Standard Patent was questioned unsuccessfully in these proceedings.
THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 7.
The Respondent whether by itself, its directors, officers, servants or agents or otherwise howsoever during the term of the Standard Patent is restrained from infringing claims 1 to 8 inclusive of the Standard Patent and in particular, from: 
 
 (a) importing, making, selling, supplying, or otherwise disposing of or offering to make, sell, supply or otherwise dispose of or using or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things,, the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No.
TRM 50 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark I");
 
 (b) importing, making, selling, supplying, or otherwise disposing of or offering to make, sell, supply or otherwise dispose of or using or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things, the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No.
TRM 51 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark II");
 
 (c) authorising any person to do any act which would be a breach of the injunction referred to 7(a) and (b) above.

 

3 Senior counsel for GMCA argued that the findings of the Court in relation to the Standard Patent concerned only claim 6, which dealt specifically with a power tool used as a panel saw and a jigsaw (see the full text of the claims of the Standard Patent at [16] of the substantive judgment).
4 The declarations and certificates sought are appropriate.
B  D's application from the outset sought declarations that GMCA's two products, referred to in the judgment as T1 and T2, infringed, in the case of T1, claims 1 and 3 to 8 of the Standard Patent and, in the case of T2, claims 1 to 6.
The cross-claim sought declarations of invalidity of those claims.
Thus the validity of all claims was in issue.
Likewise the respondent sought revocation on alleged grounds of invalidity, which referred to all claims.
Debate particularly centred on the term "vector" which appears in claim 1 and is carried forward into all the subsequent claims.
The declarations and certificates sought are appropriate.
5 It is proper to have an injunction not only referring to particular products found to have infringed, but also in respect of any other infringing products which the infringer might produce or sell: see Welcome Real-Time SA v Catuity Inc (No 2) [2001] FCA 785.
Costs in relation to design infringement issues 
 
6 I held that B  D's design was valid but not infringed.
Thus each side had some success in relating to design issues.
GMCA says that it should recover its costs on those issues or at least on the infringement issue.
B  D says there should be no reduction of a general order as to costs in relation to design issues or at worst there should be no order as to costs.
7 As a general rule a court should be reluctant to undertake an enquiry as to who was successful on particular issues for the purpose of determining whether there should be an apportionment of costs against the successful party: see Dr Martens v Figgins Holdings (No 2) [2000] FCA 602 at [54] where Goldberg J said:
 A court should not be too ready to disallow costs simply because a party has failed upon an issue, unless it be quite a separate and distinct issue from the issues in respect of which it succeeded or unless there be some element of unreasonableness or inappropriate conduct in relation to that issue.
See also Cretazzo v Lombardi (1975) 13 SASR 4 at 16.
8 In the present case B  D did not fail on all issues relating to the design.
The design infringement issue did not take up a major part of the design case, still less of the total hearing.
From a commercial aspect it was understandable that B  D should pursue design infringement as well as the Standard and Innovation Patent infringements as they were all bound up with the one product.
Also, the design infringement issue, turning as it did essentially on visual inspection, did not become the subject of very detailed expert evidence, although there was some.
There was no witness whose evidence was confined to design infringement, the one issue on which GMCA succeeded.
