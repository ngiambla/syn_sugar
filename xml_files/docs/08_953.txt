 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 Mr Smith has filed a petition under s 355 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) ('the Act') in respect of the half Senate election held on 24 November 2007 ('the election').
The petition was filed in the High Court on 25 January 2008 as the Court of Disputed Returns (s 354 of the Act).
On 8 April 2008 Gummow J referred the matter to this Court on the application of the respondent ('the Commission').
The Commission also sought an order that the petition be dismissed, on the grounds that:
 
1.
First, as a matter of form, the petition fails to comply with s 358 of the Act.
2.
Secondly, as a matter of substance, the petition is doomed to failure.
2 As the first of those grounds may be determinative of the petition, I proceeded to consider it separately.
3 Mr Smith was the No 1 Senate candidate for The Fishing Party, contesting the election in Queensland in the above the line group ticket G. He alleges in the petition that the Commission registered a political party that contested the election for Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia, named the Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party ('the Fishing and Lifestyle Party').
He alleges that the Fishing and Lifestyle Party obtained Federal political party registration by "fraud or misrepresentation".
For the purposes of considering the form of the petition and compliance with the Act, that allegation is accepted, as is the fact that it constitutes "illegal practice" within the meaning of the Act.
"Illegal practice" is defined in s 352(1) as '... a contravention of this Act or the regulations ' and is a ground for voiding an election (s 362 of the Act).
DOES THE PETITION COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT?

 
4 The Court has the power to declare an election void (s 360(1)(vii) of the Act).
Section 358(1) of the Act provides that subject to subs (2), no proceedings shall be had on a petition unless the requirements of s 355 are complied with.
5 Section 355 sets out the pre-requisites of a petition under the Act.
That section relevantly provides:
 ...every petition disputing an election or return in this Part called the petition shall: (a) set out the facts relied on to invalidate the election or return; 
 
 (aa) subject to subsection 358(2), set out those facts with sufficient particularity to identify the specific matter or matters on which the petitioner relies as justifying the grant of relief; 
 
 ... 
 
 (e) be filed in the Registry of the High Court within 40 days after: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 (ii) if the polling day for the election in dispute is also the polling day for another election or other elections --- the return of whichever of the writs for the election in dispute and that other election or those other elections is returned last 
 
 
 
6 It is also necessary to record s 362 of the Act which relevantly provides in subs (3):
 The Court of Disputed Returns shall not declare...any election void...unless the Court is satisfied that the result of the election was likely to be affected, and that it is just...that the election should be declared void.
Does the petition set out the facts relied on?
