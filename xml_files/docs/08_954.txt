 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 The applicant (' SFC ') came into existence on 1 July 2004 as a consequence of the enactment of s 35A(1) of the Transport Administration Amendment (Sydney Ferries) Act 2003 (NSW) .
It is a ' State Owned Corporation ': State Owned Corporations Act 1989 (NSW) , s 20A , Sch 5.
2 SFC operates an extensive ferry service on Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River every day of the year.
On any given week day, SFC carries about 35,000 passengers.
As at 30 April 2008, it employed 742 staff.
Its principal statutory objective is ' to deliver safe and reliable Sydney ferry services in an efficient, effective and financially responsible manner '.
3 The first respondent (' AMOU ') represents the Masters and Inner Harbour Engineers (collectively ' Maritime Officers ') employed by SFC.
AMOU is an organisation registered under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (' WR Act ') and has corporate status conferred by the WR Act.

 
4 The second-named second respondent (' SUA ') represents the General Purpose Hands (' GPHs ') employed by SFC.
The SUA is an organisation registered under the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (NSW) (' NSW Act ') and is not registered under the WR Act.
(The first-named second respondent (' MUA ') has been represented in the proceedings by the same solicitors and counsel as SUA and there is no need to refer further to it separately.
) 
 
5 The third respondent (' AIMPE '), an organisation registered under the WR Act, represents the Outer Harbour Engineers (' OHEs ') employed by SFC.
6 The present litigation arises out of SFC's attempts to introduce a new ' crew based ' rostering system for its employees.
The evidence indicates that it has endeavoured unsuccessfully to reach agreement with the respondents for the introduction of such a roster over a protracted period.
The negotiations between SFC and the respondents having apparently broken down, SFC decided that it would introduce a crew based system unilaterally, although not necessarily in precisely the form that had been the subject of negotiations.
To that end, on 2 May 2008, SFC gave notice to its employees that it intended to introduce new crew based rosters on and from 2 June 2008.
7 One issue that has arisen is whether SFC is entitled under the terms of the relevant Enterprise Agreements to introduce the new crew based rosters without the agreement of the respondents.
In these proceedings, as originally framed, SFC sought declarations to the effect that, on the proper construction of the Enterprise Agreements, it is not required to obtain the agreement of each of the respondents before giving notice of its intention to introduce the new roster.
As I shall explain, SFC now seeks relief only against AMOU.
8 SFC seeks the relief pursuant to s 849 of the WR Act , which provides as follows:
 
 ' 849 (1) The Court ... may give an interpretation of a collective agreement on application by: 
 
 (a) the Minister; or 
 
 (b) an organisation or person bound by the agreement; or 
 
 (c) an employee whose employment is subject to the agreement.
