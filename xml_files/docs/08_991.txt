 Background 
 
 The matter presently before the Court is a Notice of Motion filed by the respondent on 6 June 2008.
It is a sequel to two Notices of Motion which were the subject of decision in Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 60.
The earlier motions were referred to at [46] and [48] of that judgment of 8 February 2008.
The substantive orders sought in the Notice of Motion filed by the respondent on 9 March 2007 were as follows: 
 
 
 '1.
The proceedings be dismissed pursuant to section 31A of the Federal Court Act 1976 and Order 20 rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules .

 
 2.
Alternatively, the proceedings be stayed pursuant to Order 20 rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules .

 
 3.
Further and in the alternative, the statement of claim be struck out pursuant to Order 11 rule 16 of the Federal Court Rules , and the application be dismissed.

 ...' 
 


 
 The Notice of Motion filed by the applicant on 5 March 2007 was superseded by an Amended Notice of Motion filed on 11 April 2007 at the conclusion of the hearing on 4, 5 and 11 April 2007.
The orders sought by the applicant in the Amended Notice of Motion were as follows: 
 
 
 '1A Granting leave to the applicant to file and serve an amended application in the form of the draft amended application attached to the affidavit of Bruce Elliott Rowntree, sworn and affirmed (sic) 5 March 2006; 
 
 
 
 
 
 1.
Granting leave to the applicant to file and serve an amended statement of claim in the form of exhibit NM1 on the hearing of the notice of motion filed 5 March 2007.

 
 2. that should the statement of claim be struck out, leave to amend or an order under Order 10 Rule 1(2)(b) that the application proceed on affidavits; 
 
 3. that should the application be struck out, the court grant preliminary discovery under Order 15A Rule 6; 
 
 4. that any associated proceedings transferred from the Federal Magistrates Court be heard sequentially at the conclusion of the current proceedings; 
 
 5. that the matter proceed on affidavits.
' 
 


 
 The orders made on 8 February 2008 disposed of both Notices of Motion.
Relevantly those orders were as follows: 
 
 
 ' THE COURT: 
 
 1.
Grants leave to the applicant to file and serve a Notice For Discovery on the respondent on or before 29 February 2008 requiring the respondent, within 28 days after service of the Notice, to give discovery with verification of documents relating to the exercise, or possible exercise, by the Commissioner, whether before or after 29 July 2004, of the discretion conferred upon him by s 227(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the Act') to remit the whole or any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant under s 226K of the Act and referred to in the Notice of Amended Assessment issued on 29 July 2004.

 
 2.
Grants leave to the applicant to amend the Application filed 10 October 2006 by filing and serving an Amended Application on or before 18 April 2008.

 
 3.
Grants leave to the applicant to amend the Statement of Claim filed 10 October 2006 by filing and serving an Amended Statement of Claim on or before 18 April 2008.

 
 4.
Orders that, in the event that an Amended Statement of Claim is not filed on or before 18 April 2008, the Statement of Claim filed 10 October 2006 shall, without further order, be struck out.

 
 5.
Orders that, in the event that an Amended Application is not filed on or before 18 April 2008, the application filed 10 October 2006 shall, without further order, be dismissed generally.

 ... 
 
 7.
Orders that the applicant pay one half of the respondent's costs of the applicant's Amended Notice of Motion filed 11 April 2007 and that such costs may be taxed and shall be payable forthwith.

 
 8.
Orders that the respondent's Notice of Motion filed 9 March 2007 be dismissed.

 
 9.
Orders that there be no order as to costs in respect of the respondent's Notice of Motion filed 9 March 2007.

 ...' 
 


 
 On 28 February 2008 the applicant filed and served a Notice for Discovery on the respondent which called for the discovery of a number of documents in relation to a decision said to have been made by the respondent not to remit additional tax imposed by s 226K of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the Assessment Act') in connection with 'the amended income tax assessment of the applicant for the year of income ended 30 June 1999'.
The Notice for Discovery also called upon the respondent to give discovery with verification of a number of documents which related to other matters.
On 16 April 2008 an order was made setting aside paragraphs 1(k), 1(l), 1(q), 1(r), 1(s), 2, 3 and 4 of the Schedule to the Notice for Discovery.
The Court also ordered that a revised expression of subparagraph 1(q) could stand as part of the Notice for Discovery.
On 16 April 2008 a further order was made extending the time for compliance with the Notice for Discovery until Monday 21 April 2008.
In addition an order was made substituting the date 26 May 2008 for 18 April 2008 in orders 2, 3, 4 and 5 as made on 8 February 2008.
In the foregoing context, the applicant filed an Amended Application on 26 May 2008 and an Amended Statement of Claim on the same day.
The original Application had been filed on 10 October 2006.
When the earlier motions were heard a proposed Amended Application was considered as was a proposed Amended Statement of Claim (see prayers for relief 1A and 1 at [3] above).
However, neither of those documents was ever filed, no leave to do so having been granted.

 The Notice of Motion filed 6 June 2008 
 
 The Notice of Motion filed by the respondent on 6 June 2008 seeks orders as follows: 
'1.
That this motion be heard with expedition.

 
 2.
That the following words from the first substantive paragraph of the Amended Application (filed 26 May 2008) be struck out: 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... to contest the validity of a Notice of Amended Assessment for the year of income ended 30 June 1999, which was communicated to the Applicant in a purported Notice of Assessment issued on 29 July 2004.

 
 
 
 
 
 3.
That proposed order 2 in the Amended Application be struck out, or alternatively summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

 
 4.
That proposed order 2 in the Amended Statement of Claim (filed 26 May 2008) be struck out pursuant to rule 16 of Order 11 of the Federal Court Rules .

 
 5.
That the paragraphs 36 and 37 of the Amended Statement of Claim be struck out and that in consequence the balance of the Statement of Claim be struck out.

 
 6.
That the Amended Application be summarily dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).

 
 7.
The applicant pay the respondent's costs of the motion.

 
 8.
The applicant pay the respondent's costs, including reserved costs.

 
 9.
Such other orders as the Court deems necessary or desirable.
' 
 


 
 Given that the present motion is truly a sequel to the two Notices of Motion which were the subject of decision in Bonnell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 60 it is inappropriate to recount all of the relevant facts again.
The facts and matters and statements of legal principle as recorded in the earlier judgment should be treated as having been restated in full in these reasons.
By way of introduction, it is necessary to refer to the Notice of Amended Assessment issued on 29 July 2004 whereby the Commissioner disallowed the claimed deduction by the applicant of an amount of $5 million with the consequence that tax of approximately $2.4 million became payable in respect of the applicant's amended taxable income for the year of income ended 30 June 1999.
In accordance with s 226K of the Assessment Act, the appellant became liable to pay additional tax, by way of penalty, in the sum of $606,250.00, none of which was remitted by the Commissioner in accordance with s 227(3) of the Assessment Act (see [11]-[12] of the earlier judgment).
In the Statement of Claim filed 10 October 2006 a number of allegations of fact were made by the applicant (see [45] of the earlier judgment).
One of the allegations was to the effect that the Notice of Amended Assessment was invalid because the amendment decision to impose penalties was not a bona fide attempt by the Respondent or the Respondent's officers to exercise the Respondent's power to amend.
In an email dated 5 December 2005 the applicant had said 'one of the allegations I have made consistently is that the levying of penalties against me was done for an improper purpose'.
At [121] of the earlier judgment the matter so alleged by the applicant was rejected, but the possibility of an alternative allegation being sustained, was entertained.

'121 ...
Such an allegation in respect of the "levying of penalties" cannot be sustained in these proceedings.
However, an allegation that a decision taken by the Commissioner in exercise of his discretion under s 227(3) of the Assessment Act not to remit the whole or any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant by way of penalty under s 226K of the Assessment Act was taken for "an improper purpose" may be sustained.
On my understanding it is this second allegation which underpins the case which the applicant now wishes to bring.
' 

 
 Section 227 of the Assessment Act provided follows: 
 
 
 
 '227(1) The Commissioner shall make an assessment of the additional tax payable by a person under a provision of this Part.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to preclude notice of an assessment made in respect of a person under subsection (1) from being incorporated in notice of any other assessment made in respect of the person under this Act.

 
 (3) The Commissioner may, in the Commissioner's discretion, remit the whole or any part of the additional tax payable by a person under a provision of this Part, but, for the purposes of the application of subsection 33(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to the power of remission conferred by this subsection, nothing in this Act shall be taken to preclude the exercise of the power at a time before an assessment is made under subsection (1) of the additional tax.
' 
 
 


 
 Section 33(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), to which reference was made in s 227(3) of the Assessment Act, provided: 
 
 
 '33(1) Where an Act confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed from time to time as occasion requires.
' 
 


 
 Section 227(1) of the Assessment Act required the Commissioner to make an assessment of the additional tax payable by a person under, relevantly, s 226K of the Assessment Act.
Section 227(2) empowered the respondent to incorporate notice of the assessment of additional tax payable under s 226K in a notice of amended assessment under s 170(1) of the Assessment Act.
The power of remission, which is central to the issues presently before the Court, was contained in s 227(3) of the Assessment Act.
It permitted the Commissioner, in his discretion, to 'remit the whole or any part of the additional tax payable by a person under a provision of this Part'.
The Commissioner contended that he addressed the discretion conferred upon him by s 227(3) of the Assessment Act and made a decision not to remit any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant prior to the issue of the Notice of Amended Assessment on 29 July 2004.
As indicated at [114] in the earlier judgment, it seemed to me that what, relevantly, occurred in this case was: 

(a) the Commissioner, in exercise of his power to do so under s 170(1) of the Assessment Act, amended his assessment of the amount of the applicant's taxable income and of the tax payable thereon.
This amendment resulted from a disallowance of the applicant's claimed deduction from his assessable income of $5 million by way of contribution to, I assume, the 'Bonnell No.
2 Superannuation Fund';
 
(b) by s 226K of the Assessment Act, the applicant became liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 25% of the amount of the tax shortfall.
That amount was $606,250.00;
 
(c) in fulfilment of his duty under s 227(1) of the Assessment Act to do so, the Commissioner made an assessment of the additional tax payable by the applicant under s 226K;
 
(d) as required by s 174 of the Assessment Act, the Commissioner served the Notice of Amended Assessment issued on 29 July 2004 upon the applicant which Notice included notice of the assessment of the additional tax under s 227(1), as authorised by s 227(2).

 At [85] of the earlier judgment I expressed the opinion that the privative provisions of the Assessment Act (ss 175 and 177 --- see [20] and [21]) did not apply where the applicant's present challenge was not, in reality, to any assessment of the amount of his taxable income or of the tax payable thereon, but rather to a failure on the part of the Commissioner to remit the amount of the additional tax for which he was liable under s 226K of the Assessment Act or some part thereof, whether before or after the issue of the Notice of Amended Assessment.
In the foregoing context I said at [115] and [116]: 
'115 Whether and when the Commissioner addressed his discretion to remit the whole or any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant is a matter of some conjecture.
It is clear that the Commissioner had the power, under s 227(3) of the Assessment Act, to remit the additional tax or part thereof before the Commissioner made the assessment of the additional tax as required by s 227(1).
... 116 There is no evidence to suggest that the applicant has called on the Commissioner to exercise the discretion conferred on him by s 227(3) in the applicant's favour.
What is clear is that if the Commissioner addressed his discretion before 29 July 2004, he did not exercise it in the applicant's favour.
As previously indicated (at [13]) the Commissioner contends that he did address the discretion before the issue of the Notice of Amended Assessment on 29 July 2004 and that he made a decision not to remit any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant.
However there is no evidence to support that contention and no evidence to indicate that the applicant was ever informed of that fact, if it was the case.
' 

 
 At [121] I concluded: 
121 On the material presently available and in the absence of any evidence as to the Commissioner's exercise of his discretion under s 227(3) of the Assessment Act, I am not satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding insofar as it may claim relief in relation to the exercise of that discretion under s 39B of the Judiciary Act, reliance being placed on one or other of the Hickman provisos.
...' 

 Good faith within the meaning of Hickman 
 
 Detailed consideration was given to the Hickman provisos at [15] --- [43] of the earlier judgment.
In The King v Murray; Ex parte Proctor [1949] HCA 10 ; (1949) 77 CLR 387 at 400 Dixon J, as his Honour then was, treated the Hickman provisos as being satisfied if 'there has been an honest attempt to deal with a subject matter confided to [in a case such as the present, the Commissioner] and to act in pursuance of the powers of the [Commissioner] in relation to something that might reasonably be regarded as falling within [the Commissioner's] province'.
As Brennan J said in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Limited [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168 at 194 privative clauses such as ss 175 and 177 of the Assessment Act are: 
 
 '... given effect despite non-compliance with the provisions governing the exercise of the power, but only if the purported exercise is a bona fide attempt to exercise the power, it relates to the subject matter of the legislation and it is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body purporting to exercise it.
The validating provision cannot be so construed if the impugned act by the repository of the power is not referable to the power given to the repository or exceeds the power which can constitutionally be given to the repository.
' 


 
 In relation to the Hickman provisos in the context of the Assessment Act Finn J said in Daihatsu Australia Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 47 ATR 156 at [29]-[38]: 
'[29] As has recently been indicated by the full court of this court in Kordan Pty Ltd v FCT (2000) 44 ATR 131 , it is the clear intendment of ss 175 and 177 of the ITAA 1936 that taxpayers not be permitted to seek judicial review of the processes leading to, and the making of, assessments by the Commissioner of Taxation.
Rather taxpayers are to be confined to the objection and appeal remedy now contained in Pt IVC of the TAA: see Kordan's case at [1].
[30] Sections 175 and 177 are, though, subject to the rule of construction enunciated in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox  Clinton, in relation to privative clauses: DCT v Richard Walter [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168 ; 29 ATR 644 ; 95 ATC 4067 ; see also, Sunrise Auto Ltd v FCT (1995) 61 FCR 446 ; 32 ATR 347 ; 95 ATC 4840 ; with the consequence that an assessment will lose the protection of ss 177(1) and 175, and its validity will be open to challenge, if it is not made in compliance with the Hickman principle: Briglia v FCT (2000) 44 ATR 166 at 168; ATC 4247 at 4249 and the cases referred to therein.
[31] For present purposes it can be said that that principle will not be breached if in making the assessment in question (1) there was a bona fide attempt by the Commissioner to exercise the power of assessment; (2) that attempt related to the subject matter of the ITAA 1936; and (3) it was reasonably capable of reference to the Commissioner's power of assessment: but see Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council (1999) 46 NSWLR 78 per Spigelman CJ where additional possible elements in the principle are considered.
In the present case the assessments in question have been impugned principally in reliance on the first of these propositions (bona fide attempt) although it is alleged as well that the third of the propositions (reasonably capable of reference to the power of assessment) was not satisfied.
[32] In Kordan's case, the full court observed that: 
 
 [t]he allegation that the Commissioner, or those exercising his powers by delegation, acted other than in good faith in assessing a taxpayer to income tax is a serious allegation and not one lightly to be made.
It is, thus, not particularly surprising that applications directed at setting aside assessments on the basis of absence of good faith have generally been unsuccessful.
Indeed one would hope that this was and would continue to be the case.
As Hill J said in San Remo Macaroni Company Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 1468 ; 99 ATC 5138 at 5154 it would be a rare case where a taxpayer will succeed in showing that an assessment has in the relevant sense been made in bad faith and should for that reason be set aside.

 
 
This view resonates with observations of other judges of this court: see eg Dan v FCT (2000) 44 ATR 338 at 345; 2000 ATC 4350 at 4356 affirmed in Kordan's case: "proof of bad faith necessitates proof of extreme circumstances".
[33] It is unsurprising that the above view has been expressed.
A premise of the rule of construction embodied in the Hickman principle is that, but for the privative clause in question (here s 175 with its s 177(1) overlay), a decision taken in the exercise of a power to which the clause relates might otherwise be invalidated in judicial review proceedings because, for example, the decision-maker "has not conformed to the requirements governing its proceedings or the exercise of its authority or has not confined its acts within the limits laid down by the instrument giving it authority": Hickman's case at 615.
To the extent that it is effective the clause saves from invalidation an assessment that would otherwise be potentially reviewable for defect or irregularity: Richard Walter, above, at 180.
Something more is required.
[34] It is likewise unsurprising that courts have shrunk from attempting a comprehensive exposition of what is and is not countenanced by the formula "a bona fide attempt to exercise [a] power".
Rather the burden of the formula has been illustrated by example as in the observations (i) "[p]lainly enough, an incorrect assessment does not demonstrate an absence of bona fides": Briglia at 4250; or (ii) "once the Commissioner forms the view that there is no substantial possibility that the item of income is assessable income of a person, it could not be a bona fide exercise of the assessing power to assess that person to tax in respect of that income.
Likewise here where it is conceded that there is no possibility at all that the assessments made were correct, there can be no assessment": Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd v FCT (1996) 72 FCR 175 at 187; 34 ATR 491 at 502; 97 ATC 4040 at 4050.
[35] The formula likewise has been illustrated by resort to some alternate formula which is appropriate to the particular context in which it is used.
In R v Comr of Taxation (WA); Ex parte Briggs (1986) 12 FCR 301 , for example, the formula used (at 308) was "a genuine attempt to ascertain the taxable income of the taxpayer" in a setting in which it was conceded that the Commissioner never intended to, and did not, embark upon the process of ascertaining the taxpayer's income.
And references commonly have been made to the terminology of "abuse of power" to characterise what was not a bona fide exercise of a power: see eg Richard Walter, above, at 219.
[36] What is clear both from the premise of the Hickman principle itself and from judicial treatment of the "bona fide attempt" formula is that, in the setting of ss 175 and 177(1), the cases will be rare and extreme in which a bad faith assessment will be able to be made out for Hickman purposes.
Often, I do not say invariably, they will be cases (i) where, knowingly, the assessment power has been exercised for an improper purpose; or (ii) where the purported assessment involved no actual attempt to ascertain or calculate the taxpayer's income as, for example, where the assessment was made on facts "known ... to be untrue": Darrell Lea Chocolates, at 188.
[37] Given its possible significance in this proceeding, I should also note that uncertainty arising from, or deficiency in, the information available to the Commissioner will not of itself preclude a bona fide attempt to assess being made: see Richard Walter, above, at 200-201.
In the case of a determination under s 136AD(4), an insufficiency of information available to the Commissioner can be the very trigger justifying resort to that provision.
[38] Finally, whether or not a denial of natural justice can in some circumstances defeat the bona fides requirement: cf O'Toole v Charles David Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 14 ; (1991) 171 CLR 232 at 305; or else some other requirement of the Hickman principle: O'Toole, at 287; Vanmeld's case, above, 105ff; Aronson and Dyer, Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 689ff (2nd ed, 2000); and on natural justice and "jurisdiction" see Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 75 ALJR 52 ; are not matters into which I need inquire in this proceeding.
...' 

 
 In SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; [2007] 81 ALJR 1401 , a case where the High Court found that the effect of a migration agent's fraud on his client in respect of an invitation to attend a hearing before the Refugee Review Tribunal was to stultify the invitation, it said in respect of fraud in public law at [12]-[13]: 
'[12] The attachment by courts of equity of the term "fraud", with related notions of "bad faith" and "abuse of power", when stigmatising exercises of powers of appointment and fiduciary powers as falling short of the standards equity required of the repositories of those powers, has proved influential in the development of public law.
What came to be known as the principle of "Wednesbury unreasonableness" was developed in the case law by analogy to the principles controlling the exercise of powers of discretions vested in trustees and others.
[13] However, several points should be made here.
First, given the equitable nature of their origins described above, principles of public law concerning impropriety in the exercise of statutory powers have not had the focus upon what might be called the "red blooded" species of fraud which engages the common law.
Second, with respect to references in the public law decisions to good and bad faith and the like, the following observation in a leading English text [17] is in point: 
 
 These add very little to the true sense, and are hardly ever used to mean more than that some action is found to have a lawful or unlawful purpose.
It is extremely rare for public authorities to be found guilty of intentional dishonesty: normally they are found to have erred, if at all, by ignorance or misunderstanding.
Yet the courts constantly accuse them of bad faith merely because they have acted unreasonably or on improper grounds.
Again and again it is laid down that powers must be exercised reasonably and in good faith.
But in this context "in good faith" means merely "for legitimate reasons".
Contrary to the natural sense of the words, they impute no moral obliquity.

 
 
Aickin J made observations to similar effect in R v Toohey; Ex parte Northern Land Council.
' (Footnotes omitted) 

 
 In considering the Commissioner's discretion under s 227(3) of the Assessment Act it is important to observe that it is a discretion going to remission of additional tax otherwise payable.
It is not a discretion which, if exercised, will impose a burden.
Rather, it is a discretion which, if exercised, will provide relief from a burden.

 The Commissioner's Discovered Documents 
 
 The case which the applicant now wishes to advance in relation to the non-remission by the Commissioner of the whole or any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant under s 226K of the Assessment Act has been propounded with the benefit of access to the documents discovered by the Commissioner on 22 April 2008 in response to the applicant's Notice for Discovery filed 28 February 2008 as amended.
Copies of the documents discovered by the respondent were tendered in evidence on the hearing of the current Notice of Motion and became Exhibit NMB.


Those documents reveal that an Assistant Commissioner, Small Business, Aggressive Tax Planning within the Australian Taxation Office was a party to a series of email communications with a Senior Tax Counsel within the office and others relating to the preparation of a 'Tax Penalty Submission'.
As part of the Office's consideration of the matter a telephone hook-up took place between a number of officers including the Assistant Commissioner, Small Business, Aggressive Tax Planning and the Senior Tax Counsel on 12 July 2004.
Minutes of the telephone hook-up meeting included the following:
 'As a result of the deliberations of the attendees, it was determined that there is nothing material in Mr Bonnell's response that would change the ATO's technical position as stated in the Position Paper.
