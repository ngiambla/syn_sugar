 Apotex Pty Ltd ('Apotex') has commenced proceedings against Les Laboratoires Servier ('Servier'), seeking a declaration that claims 1 to 18 of Australian Patent No 2001276418 ('the AC Patent') are invalid and an order that those claims be revoked.
Servier seeks to amend the AC Patent under s 105(1) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ('the Act') to add an additional set of claims.
Apotex opposes the application.
