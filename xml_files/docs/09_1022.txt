 INTRODUCTION 
 "The Bill Express Payment System" was an electronic distribution, promotion, sales and bill payment network made up of various brands including Dialtime, Bill EXPRESS, Bopo, XIP Media and Mobile EFT.
The system allowed consumers to pay various accounts and bills and to purchase products and services such as mobile phone credit at participating newsagents and merchants.
The Bill Express Payment System was provided by Bill Express Limited (ACN 090 059 564) (in liquidation) ("BXP") to participating newsagents and merchants.
To obtain the Bill Express Payment System, participating merchants entered into two contracts, usually for a term of 60 months: one with BXP to obtain the Bill Express Payment System on line ("the Merchant Contract") and the second with the Second Respondent, Technology Business International Pty Ltd (ACN 092 574 804) (in liquidation) ("TBI"), for rental of the computer and other equipment required to deliver the Bill Express Payment System ("the Rental Contract") (collectively the "Bill Express Contracts").
The Bill Express Payment System operated from 2003 until about July 2008.
During that period, between 3,500 and 4,500 merchants entered into the Bill Express Contracts.
The Applicant, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC"), contends that the circumstances surrounding the entry into, and further or alternatively the fact of entry into, the Bill Express Contracts by merchants in the period from mid 2003 until the demise of BXP in July 2008 amounted to: exclusive dealing, and in particular third line forcing as defined in s 47(6) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA"), in contravention of s 47(1) of the TPA; misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TPA; false or misleading conduct in contravention of s 53(g) of the TPA.
Each Respondent had notice of the hearing and nature of the orders sought by the ACCC.
BXP, TBI and the Fourth Respondent, Mobius Financial Services Pty Ltd (ACN 099 088 365) ("Mobius"), informed the Court that they did not intend to appear.
The Third Respondent, BNY Trust Company of Australia Ltd (ACN 050 294 052) ("BNY"), settled with the ACCC and executed terms of settlement.
Those terms of settlement, in part, are dependent on the outcome of this hearing.
For the reasons that follow, I would grant declarations and make orders in the following terms: 
 
 
 THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 
 
 

 On each occasion, between 2003 and July 2008, on which the First Respondent ("BXP") and the Second Respondent ("TBI") entered into a contract with merchants substantially in the form of one of the contracts which are Exhibit "SG-5" to the affidavit of Shane Christopher Grosser sworn on 19 May 2009 and available for inspection at the Victorian Registry of the Federal Court of Australia (respectively, a "Merchant Contract" and a "Rental Contract") they engaged in the practice of exclusive dealing as defined in s 47(6) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the TPA") (as in force at the relevant time) in contravention of s 47(1) of the TPA, by offering to supply to merchants electronic products and services under a contract with BXP ("the Bill Express Payment System"), on condition that the merchants acquired other goods and services from TBI, a company unrelated to BXP.
Between 2005 and July 2008, each of TBI and BXP engaged in conduct that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the TPA, on each occasion when it stated to merchants and prospective merchants that if they acquired the Bill Express Payment System and entered into the Merchant Contract and the Rental Contract:
 
 
 
 (1) the "net cost" would be "$0"; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (2) "the marketing subsidy will ensure you at least breakeven"; 
 
 

 
 
 
 (3) "The marketing support program has been devised to ensure that all newsagencies are in a breakeven or better position whilst they grow the system"; and / or 
 
 

 
 
 
 (4) "Cost to you = $0"; 
 
 

 
 
 
 without disclosing that, should BXP default on its contract, TBI (or any assignees) had the right to enforce the Rental Contract regardless and thereby cause a merchant who entered into a Rental Contract loss and damage.

 
 

 Between 2003 and July 2008, each of TBI and BXP made a false or misleading representation concerning the existence, exclusion or effect of a condition implied into the Rental Contracts by s 71 of the TPA and in relation to the merchants' rights under the Rental Contracts, in contravention of s 53(g) of the TPA, on each occasion it entered into a contract that incorporated a term that purported to:
 
 
 
 (a) impose on the merchants an "absolute and unconditional" obligation to pay monthly rental amounts "in all events" notwithstanding "any defect" in the equipment the subject of the contract, and notwithstanding "the condition, operation or fitness for use" of the equipment, when such terms are void pursuant to s 68(1) of the TPA; 
 
 

 
 
 
 and 
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) limit the merchants' remedies under the Rental Contract for defects in the equipment or any other breach of the contract to a claim for damages when the merchants had other remedies available to them, including the right to rescind under s 75A of the TPA.

 
 

 
 
 
 THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 
 
 

 A copy of the reasons for judgment be retained on the Court file for the purposes of s 83 of the TPA.
The form and content of these declarations and orders require further explanation.
FACTS 
 The facts are dealt with in two parts: the relevant entities and their directors and then the Bill Express Contracts and the history of dealings between BXP and TBI and the merchants.
(1) RELEVANT ENTITIES
 BXP
 BXP was incorporated on 21 October 1999.
Until 2 September 2004, BXP was called Dial Time Pty Ltd.
It became a public company on 3 September 2004.
Its ultimate holding company was On Q Group Limited (ABN 57 009 104 330).
On 8 July 2008, Craig David Crosbie ("Crosbie") and Ian Menzies Carson ("Carson") were appointed joint administrators of BXP.

TBI
 TBI was incorporated on 26 April 2000.
Prior to 10 April 2003, it was called On Q International Pty Ltd.
It had a sole shareholder --- Technology Business Holdings Pty Ltd ("TBH").
On 30 June 2008, TBI was wound up and Geoffrey Niels Handberg ("Handberg") was appointed liquidator.
Since incorporation, TBI's directors have been and are: Name Appointment Date Cease Date Ludescher, Christian 26/04/2000 26/04/2000 Christiansen, Harold 26/04/2000 14/03/2003 Di Donato, Sandro 14/03/2003 McKenzie, Ian 27/07/2003 01/06/2008 From 14 June 2002, its principal place of business was also 677 The Boulevard, Eaglemont, Victoria.

On Q Companies
 There are three companies: On Q Group Limited, On Q Company Pty Ltd and On Q Technologies Pty Ltd. At least from 2003, On Q Group Ltd was the ultimate holding company of On Q Company Pty Ltd and On Q Technologies Pty Ltd. Each of Harold Christiansen, Ian Christiansen and Julian Little was a director of the following companies from the date specified: Company Name Appointment Date On Q Group Limited Christiansen, Harold 18/03/2001 Little, Julian 18/03/2001 Christiansen, Ian 08/07/2003 On Q Company Pty Ltd 12/12/2003 On Q Technologies Pty Ltd 06/07/2000 
 
 As the facts demonstrate, in the period between 2003 and 2008, BXP and TBI were not related as that term is defined in s 4A(5) of the TPA: Dowling v Dalgety Australia Ltd [1992] FCA 35 ; (1992) 34 FCR 109 at 139 and The Paul Dainty Corporation Pty Ltd v The National Tennis Centre Trust [1990] FCA 163 ; (1990) 22 FCR 495 at 523.
During the relevant period, one was not the holding company or subsidiary of the other and BXP and TBI were not subsidiaries of the same holding company.
Mobius and BNY
 Mobius was approached by TBI to provide finance to TBI for the equipment and installation costs.
Mobius is the trust manager of the Mobius ERT-W04, ERT-W05 and ELR-01 Trusts ("the Trusts").
Mobius performed various managerial functions for the Trusts.
BNY is the trustee of the Trusts.
(2) AGREEMENTS AND HISTORY OF DEALINGS
 Notwithstanding that the Respondents did not appear at the hearing, Counsel for the ACCC sought to rely upon admissions made by BXP prior to the appointment of the administrator in July 2008.
Those admissions were contained in letters sent by BXP's solicitors to the ACCC responding to complaints made to the ACCC about the Bill Express Payment System.
The first letter from BXP's solicitors dated 4 June 2008 described the Bill Express Payment System and its operation.
Although the letter stated that it did not purport to provide a comprehensive overview of all of the matters in issue, I accept that it provides a useful summary of the structure, implementation and operation of the Bill Express Payment System at that time.
Except where noted, the following summary is extracted from that 4 June 2008 letter.
The relevant events start in early 2003.
On 1 March 2003, BXP and TBI entered into a Heads of Agreement.
The Heads of Agreement was not referred to in the 4 June 2008 letter but in a subsequent letter from BXP's solicitors dated 16 June 2008.
The recitals to that Agreement explained the business of BXP and TBI and their roles in the following terms: [BXP] is in the business of providing pre-paid and bill payment transaction management facilities to Merchants in return for transaction fees.
[BXP] contracts with Merchants to build the business of prepaid and bill payment services and to earn the right to ongoing transaction fees by providing a combination of;
 
 
 
 (B1) Host based prepaid transaction management systems and associated support services around financial collections and settlements.

 
 

 
 
 
 (B2) Access to Point of Sale Terminal Systems.

 
 

 TBI is in the business of renting equipment and providing Point of Sale Terminal Systems with added functionality beyond "prepaid and bill payment systems" including arranging the required funding and contracting with the Merchants for the rental of such equipment.

 
 
 ... 
 
 

 TBI carries the primary risk associated with contracting with the Financiers and the Merchants in terms of providing the physical Point of Sale Terminals.
[BXP] wishes to Introduce Merchants to TBI in return for an Upfront Fee and the right to the ongoing "prepaid and bill payment" transaction fees, from Introduced Merchants.
Under the Heads of Agreement, TBI were to pay BXP fees for the introduction of merchants to TBI.
Subject to the availability of acceptable finance, equipment and service agents, TBI undertook to use its "best endeavours" to provide satisfactory point of sale terminal equipment to merchants: Annexure A to the Heads of Agreement.
Interestingly, BXP made no promise and provided no undertaking that its services would continue to be supplied to merchants.
As the Heads of Agreement recorded, BXP had operated "DialTime", a distribution network of pre-paid telephony products.
"DialTime" apparently ceased in mid 2003 (noting that the company did not change its name until September 2004, see [9] above) when it was rebranded as "Bill Express".
As noted earlier (see [2]), to obtain the Bill Express Payment System, participating merchants entered into two contracts, usually for a term of 60 months: the Merchant Contract and the Rental Contract.
Merchant Contract
 The Merchant Contract (Schedule A) was subject to the terms and conditions set out in Schedule B.
Schedule B defined the "Agreement" or the "Merchant Contract" (cl 1) to mean the Merchant Contract and the Rental Contract.
I will deal with the Rental Contract shortly.
Clause 2 of the Merchant Contract entitled "Introduction" stated: 
 
 
 [BXP] has created the Service through which Merchants purchase products (physical or electronic) and / or act as [BXP's] agents to promote and sell products on behalf of selected Network Providers and suppliers.
Merchants participate in the Service by signing the Merchant [Contract] or the ...
Rental [Contract] and by agreeing to these Terms and Conditions.
These Terms and Conditions are subject to change by [BXP] from time to time by notice in writing to the Merchant, the Merchant's continued use of the Service acknowledging the binding effect of such notice.

 
 

 
 
 
 (Emphasis added).

 
 
 Clause 6 entitled "Terminal Rebates" provided: 
 
 
 [BXP] agrees to pay to the Merchant monthly in arrears the rebates for Terminal Rental Fees as per Schedule D. No rebate is payable for PC DialTime.

 
 

 The "Terminal" was dealt with in cl 7.
It provided, amongst other things that: 
 
 
 The Terminal(s) may be installed in any approved retail outlet in such position as required by the Merchant, but subject to such conditions of use specified from time to time in the Merchant Agreement.
The Merchant may, subject to this Agreement, use the Terminal for the Services.
The Merchant must not load, change, or modify the software or any other visual, physical or functional aspect of the Terminal(s) nor use the Terminal(s) to process transactions of any nature except as contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written approval of [BXP].
[BXP] will not be liable to the Merchant with respect to any transaction conducted on the Terminal except in the manner set out in the documents relating to the Service.
The Merchant acknowledges that the Terminal may not operate with full functionality at all times.
In relation to any loss suffered by the Merchant or any other person as a result of the performance or non-performance of the Terminal(s) or any repairs or remedial work required, the liability of On Q [BXP] is limited to the general indemnity provided in Clause 28 of this Agreement or to replacing the Terminal(s).

 
 

 
 
 
 (Emphasis added).

 
 

 Clause 14 of the Merchant Contract specified the merchant's obligations including that the merchant agreed to participate in the Bill Express Payment System by "observing any other obligation specified in this Agreement": cl 14(j) (or (i)).
As noted earlier (see [24]), "Agreement" was defined to mean the Merchant Contract and the Rental Contract.
Finally, cl 44 entitled "No Set-off" stated that: 
 
 
 The Merchant waives all rights of set-off against the equipment rental company, and shall pay all amounts due to the equipment rental company under the equipment rental agreement in full, without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction.

 
 

 Rental Contract
 As is apparent, the Rental Contract was inextricably linked to the Merchant Contract and an integral part of the Bill Express Payment System.
The Rental Contract was between TBI and the Merchant.
Clause 2 entitled "Rental" provided: 
 
 
 2.1 During the Term [TBI] will rent to the Merchant and the Merchant will rent from [TBI] the Terminals on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

 
 

 
 
 
 2.2 [TBI] may assign or otherwise deal with its rights under this Agreement without the Merchant's consent.

 
 

 Consistent with the terms of the Merchant Contract (see [25] --- [29] above), cl 3 of the Rental Contract provided: 
 
 
 3.1 The Merchant will pay the Terminal Rental Fee as per the package selected in Schedule A or Schedule D (PC DialTime) to [TBI] throughout the Term by direct debit, monthly in arrears.
The Rent Start Date is the Acceptance date with rental payments due on the monthly anniversary of this date and payable on the 26 th day of each month or the next Business Day.
... 
 
 

 
 
 
 3.3 The Merchant's obligations to pay the sums referred to in clause 3.1 and 3.2 are absolute and unconditional and will not be affected by anything which might otherwise affect them at law or in equity, including any defect in the Terminals or the Service or the condition, operation or fitness for use of the Terminals or the Services or any damage to or loss of the Terminals or Services or any lien or other encumbrance over or with respect to the Terminals or Services or any prohibition, interruption or other restriction of or against the Merchant's use, operation or possession of the Terminals or the Services for any reason whatsoever .
It is agreed by the parties that the Terminals Rental Fee will continue to be payable in all events in the manner and at the times agreed.
In the event that there arises any defect in the Terminals or Services or any other breach of this agreement by [TBI] the Merchant shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement and the Merchant's sole remedy under this Agreement shall be to make a claim for damages against [TBI].

 
 

 
 
 
 3.4 The Merchant indemnifies [TBI] from any liability for direct or consequential loss or damage, however arising.

 
 

 
 
 
 3.5 The Merchant waives all rights of set-off against [TBI], and shall pay all amounts due to [TBI] under this Agreement in full, without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction.

 
 

 
 
 
 (Emphasis added).

 
 

 Merchants were encouraged to enter into the Bill Express Contracts (see [2] above), by attending and viewing a presentation prepared by BXP.
The presentation explained how the Bill Express Payment System was structured and operated.
Various versions of the presentation were provided by BXP's solicitors as attachments to the 4 June 2008 letter.
Although the content of the presentations varied over time, they contained common elements.
The first presentation is dated 1 and 2 May 2003.
At that time, BXP was still known as "DialTime".
The presentation was entitled "DialTime Bill Express Newsagent Business Opportunity 'Expanding through Electronic Retailing'".
The presentation explained, amongst other things, that DialTime was an expandable multi-application device on one flexible technology platform which generated revenue to the merchant from "bill payment, pre-paid, Eftpos savings, telephony, email and internet".
At that time, "three packages" were on offer.
Each package was said to have different costs, hardware and revenues.
The packages and their respective monthly costs were described in the following terms: 
 
 1.
Package 1 --- PBE (Prepaid, Bill Payment  EFTPOS) $160 
 

 
 
 2.
Package 2 --- PBEC (Prepaid, Bill Payment, EFTPOS, Account Cards) $385 
 

 
 
 3.
Package 3 --- PBECA (Prepaid, Bill Payment, EFT, Cards, Advertising) $495 
 

 
 
 4.
Up front setup fees of $395 once off apply to Package 1 only 
 

 
 
 5.
All packages include physical installation costs paid by DialTime.

 

 
Most merchants selected Package 3 which obliged the merchant to pay TBI a rental fee of $495 plus stamp duty, plus GST per month, which was collected from the merchant by direct debit.
Under "Packages 2 and 3", prospective merchants would "enjoy first 3 month 25% rental rebate off $385  $495 while cards  advertising systems [were] installed, account card details loaded etc".
The presentation reviewed the financial business case for each package.
For example, the "business case" for "Hi Volume Pack 3" described the "Summary Estimated Totals" to be (I have adopted the format used elsewhere in the presentation): ESTIMATE Allow 50%
Error Factor Gross Profit Per Month $3377 $1689 Less Opt 3 PBECA Cost ($495) ($495) Net Gain $2882 $1194 
Each business case suggested that a merchant would not be out of pocket even allowing for what it described as a "50% error factor".
The presentation concluded with the heading "Next Steps --- Snap Shot".
