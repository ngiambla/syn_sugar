 By an application filed on 2 March 2007, the respondent, Les Laboratoires Servier ('Servier') sought to amend Australian Patent No 2001276418.
The patent application was filed on 6 July 2001.
I found the proposed amendments allowable under s 102 of the Patents Act 1990 ('the Act') but, in the exercise of the discretion afforded by s 105 of the Act, declined to allow the amendments ( Apotex Pty Ltd v Les Laboratoires Servier (No 2) [2009] FCA 1019).
I indicated in my reasons that I considered it appropriate that Servier pay the applicant's costs of the application, which was dismissed.
However, as the parties had not made submissions on costs, I indicated that that order would be stayed to give the parties an opportunity to make submissions if they wished to do so.
Servier submits that although the ultimate result was in Apotex's favour and Apotex is entitled to have costs of the hearing, it is appropriate to allow a discount in Servier's favour to account for Servier's success in relation to the allowability of the amendments under s 102.
Servier points out that the issues as to whether or not the amendments were allowable under s 102 of the Act were complex and involved evidence from two experts.
In those circumstances, where half of the hearing time concerned those issues, Servier submits that Apotex's entitlement should be discounted by 50%.
There are a number of reasons why, in my view, it is appropriate that Servier pay Apotex's costs, despite its success in establishing that the amendments are allowable under s 102: It follows that, in this case, it is appropriate that costs follow the event.
There is no need to make a further order for costs, as the stay on the order previously made will have automatically expired.
I certify that the preceding six (6) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Bennett.
