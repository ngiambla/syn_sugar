 This proceeding requires, in substance, the winding up of a business relationship between an Australian supplier of certain pharmaceutical products, Hamilton Laboratories Pty Ltd, and its sole distributor in Hong Kong, Australian Medic-Care Co Ltd ("AMC").
Viewed superficially, their formal relationship was that of supplier and exclusive distributor.
Their relationship over time, though, was considerably more complex than that.
It contained elements that could loosely be described as those of a joint venture.
There was little reflected in the contract which, for the purpose of this matter, purportedly defined their relationship.
AMC (or its precursor) first began dealings with Hamilton in 1988.
By the early 2000s, their business relationship began to fray.
For practical purposes, it came to an end in 2006.
What is now perfectly clear is that there was by then a total failure of mutual trust and confidence between the principals of the two companies.
If the business form they had chosen had been a company or a partnership, the unravelling of their relationship could have occurred reasonably expeditiously using well known and well worn statutory procedures which can be availed of when mutual trust and confidence have been destroyed: for companies, see Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), s 461(k) ; for partnerships, Partnership Act 1891 (SA), s 35(d).
Here the parties left it to the law of contract to define their relationship.
