 The first applicant, Robert Hine, is the sole director and shareholder of the second applicant, CPR Property Pty Ltd ( CPR Property ).
CPR Property carried out cleaning and maintenance work as a subcontractor on behalf of the first respondent, the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation ( the Corporation ), a statutory body associated with the NSW Department of Housing ( the Department ).
On 24 March 2004 the Corporation prohibited its contractors from using CPR Property as a subcontractor, relying on a provision in the contracts between the Corporation and its contractors about the use of subcontractors.
The applicants claim that the Corporation's conduct on 24 March 2004 contravened s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) ("[a] person shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive").
They also claim that, by the same conduct, the Corporation breached a duty of care it owed to the applicants and made a negligent misstatement to the contractors.
Finally, the applicants claim that, again by the same conduct, the Corporation unlawfully interfered with the contractual relationship between the contractors and CPR Property and thus committed the tort of inducing a breach of contract.
The applicants contend that by reason of the Corporation's conduct they have suffered loss and damage for which the Corporation and the State of New South Wales (of which the Department is an emanation) should be held liable.
The applicants' claims initially included alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
In Hine v New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation [2008] FCA 62 Graham J dismissed a notice of motion seeking to strike out the proceeding on the ground of lack of federal jurisdiction.
Accordingly, the proceeding remains for determination in this Court despite the fact that the applicants' present claim does not include any federal element.
On 14 April 2009 Graham J ordered that the question of liability be decided separately from and before the question of quantum of damage in the proceeding in accordance with Order 29 rule 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules .
These reasons, accordingly, deal with the question of liability only.
The evidence ranged widely.
I propose to deal with the facts in the context of the four causes of action (misleading and deceptive conduct, breach of a duty of care, negligent misstatement, and procuring breach of contract).
Before doing so I should note two matters.
First, the Corporation's prohibition on its contractors using CPR Property as a subcontractor arose out of allegations against one of the Department's employees.
The evidence in this proceeding thus includes references to unproven allegations against this employee.
The employee is not a party to this proceeding.
He did not give evidence in this proceeding.
None of the allegations to which the evidence refers have been tested in this proceeding.
For these reasons I consider that it would be unfair and unjust to name the employee in my reasons and, instead, I will refer to the employee as AB.
Further, I should record that I cannot and do not make any adverse finding of any kind in respect of AB.
Insofar as the allegations about AB involved Mr Hine and CPR Property, Mr Hine has provided evidence in this proceeding both denying the allegations and explaining the lack of substance in the suggestion that he was involved in any form of impropriety in connection with AB.
The respondents did not challenge any aspect of Mr Hine's testimony in this regard.
Insofar as the allegations about AB involved another company called Willowdene Constructions Pty Limited ( Willowdene ), an investigation by Ernst  Young completed after the main events in issue in this proceeding cleared Willowdene of any involvement in any wrongdoing.
When reading my reasons for decision, which necessarily identify these allegations by reference to the circumstances at the time, these important matters about the untested and/or unfounded nature of the allegations must be kept in mind.
Second, the relationship between the Corporation, the Department and the State of New South Wales needs some further explanation.
The Department is an agency of the State of New South Wales created by administrative arrangement of the New South Wales Government.
The Department has no legal identity separate from that of the State.
The State of NSW can be sued for the actions of its agents under s 5 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW).
From 1 July 2001 the Corporation was constituted as a statutory corporation under s 6(1) of the Housing Act 2001 (NSW).
The Corporation thus has separate legal identity and can sue and be sued in its own name (s 50 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW)).
Under s 6(7) of the Housing Act the Corporation may exercise any of its functions, and may otherwise act, in the name of the Department.
Under s 6(8) the Corporation and the Department are, to the maximum extent possible, to act in a complementary manner, so as to achieve a unified administration of the Housing Act .
The Corporation cannot employ any staff (s 7(3)).
The Department employs the staff.
The employees act in the name of the Department and the Corporation as required.
The Director-General of the Department manages the affairs of the Corporation and any "act, matter or thing done in the name of, or on behalf of, the Corporation by the Director-General, or with the authority of the Director-General, is taken to have been done by the Corporation" (s 6(3)).
Most of the references in the evidence are to the Department although the contractual arrangements are between the Corporation and other entities.
Given the statutory context, the hearing was run on the basis that conduct of the Corporation may be treated as conduct of the Department and conduct of the Department is conduct for which the State of New South Wales is liable.
In these reasons I mostly refer to the Department except where dealing with the specific terms of the contracts between the Corporation and others (which nevertheless vest rights in representatives of the Department).
SOME UNCONTROVERSIAL FACTS 
 On 3 June 2002 the Corporation entered into contracts with each of Willowdene and Transfield Services (Australia) Pty Limited ( Transfield ).
These contracts were in substantially the same terms.
I refer to these contracts as the Willowdene head contract and Transfield head contract respectively.
When referring to both contracts I refer to them as the head contracts.
The head contracts relate to the provision of maintenance services in various areas in which the Department owns properties.
The head contracts provide for the contractors to carry out works under work orders at certain scheduled rates.
The head contracts were to expire on 30 June 2004 with a capacity for extension by the Department until 30 June 2006.
In accordance with cl 1 of the general conditions of contract (which formed part of the head contracts) the Director-General of the Department is the Principal.
The Principal's Representative is a nominated officer of the Department, Dennis Schultz.
The head contracts are described as schedule of rates contracts (cl 2 of the general conditions of contract).
Specifically, the Principal does not guarantee the contractor any particular level of work and does not give the contractor any exclusive right to the work in the areas covered by it.
Clause 6 of the general conditions of contract precludes the contractor from subcontracting the works unless the contractor has obtained the written approval of the Principal's Representative to do so, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
Clause 14 of the general conditions of contract provides that if the head contract enables the Principal's Representative to give a direction to the contractor, the contractor must comply with that direction.
Clause 16 of the general conditions of contract is such a provision.
Its terms are critical to the applicants' claims and are set out in full below: CONTRACTOR'S AND SUBCONTRACTOR'S EMPLOYEES 
 
 
 The Contractor shall provide labour and all supervision necessary for the proper and complete performance of the Works at the cost and expense of the Contractor.

 

 
 
 The Contractor shall employ and ensure that subcontractors employ in connection with the Works only such persons as are careful, skilled, experienced and properly licensed.

 

 
 
 The Principal shall be entitled to prohibit the Contractor from using any person or subcontractor in the performance of the Works if the Principal's Representative reasonably regards that person or subcontractor as incompetent, negligent or otherwise unsuitable.

 

 
 
 The Contractor shall ensure as far as reasonably practical, that it does not use any person in connection with the performance of the Works who is convicted or has within the previous five years been convicted of a criminal offence involving dishonesty, theft or violence and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the Contractor shall have an effective screening procedure for existing and new employees used in connection with the provision of the Works.
The screening procedure shall include:
 (a) validation of previous employment, previous employment references and present address;
 (b) checks and inquiries relating to criminal records;
 (c) receipt and validation of the employee's tax file number; and
 (d) notification procedure with respect to any subsequent criminal offences.

 

 Clause 9.3 of the work requirements (also forming a part of the head contract) provides that if a subcontractor requires information the information will be supplied only through the contractor.
The contractor is required to acquaint all subcontractors with this requirement.
Each of the contractors under the head contracts, Willowdene and Transfield, entered into a subcontract with CPR Property.
The Willowdene subcontract relates to carpentry and cleaning and specifies a schedule of rates for each work type.
It specifies a completion date of 30 June 2004 but not the commencement date.
I infer that the agreement commenced on or about the same time as the head contracts (3 June 2002).
The Willowdene subcontract is not signed but Mr Hine acknowledged that he worked in accordance with the rates specified in it.
The Willowdene subcontract contains a provision that all communications arising out of the head contract will be between the Principal's Representative and the contractor and should a subcontractor require information it will be supplied only through the contractor.
The Transfield subcontract is dated on or about 6 August 2002, and was renewed on 9 April 2003.
Amongst other things the Transfield subcontract requires CPR Property to provide the services in accordance with various documents (including the work requirements forming part of the head contract) copies of which were said to be "available on request".
Mr Hine and others attended a "contract specific induction" conducted by Transfield.
On 24 March 2004 the Corporation issued to Willowdene a direction under cl 16 of the general conditions of contract forming part of the Willowdene head contract.
The terms of the direction were as follows:
 
 
 TO: WILLOWDENE PTY LIMITED ("the Contractor") 
 

 
 
 NOTICE UNDER CLAUSE 16 OF THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT 
 

 
 
 In accordance with clause 16 of the General Conditions of Contract the Principal's Representative directs that the Contractor is prohibited from using the person/s and/or entity/ies named in Schedule 1 in the performance of the Works as the Principal's Representative reasonably regards them as unsuitable on account of the matters raised in Schedule 2.

 

 
 
 Signed D Schultz

 CPR Property Pty Limited (ACN 100 407 341) 
 

 
 Schedule 2 
 

 
 
 The person/s and/or entities involvement in a pending investigation by their Department into their association with a Departmental employee, and certain allegations of misconduct made against the employee arising therefrom.

 

 On the same day the Principal's Representative, Mr Schultz, contacted Transfield's contract manager.
According to a report signed by Mr Schultz on 26 March 2004, on 24 March 2004 Mr Schultz advised Transfield's contract manager that Transfield was "not to use the services of CPR Property until further notice".
The respondents acknowledged that this communication was also the giving of a direction prohibiting Transfield from using CPR Property as a subcontractor under cl 16 of the general conditions of contract forming part of the Transfield head contract.
Willowdene and Transfield immediately ceased to use CPR Property under the head contracts as a subcontractor for work required to be carried out on the Department's properties.
CPR Property has not worked on any property owned by the Department since that date.
MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE CONDUCT CLAIM 
 The competing submissions 
 The applicants' primary case for breach of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act is that Mr Schultz's written direction to Willowdene and oral direction to Transfield on 24 March 2004 represented to each that he, as the Principal's Representative, reasonably regarded CPR Property as unsuitable such as to warrant CPR Property being prohibited from carrying out work on the Department's properties.
A prohibition, submitted the applicants, is inherently permanent.
The directions given thus conveyed a representation that CPR Property was unsuitable such as to warrant permanent preclusion from working as a subcontractor for the Department.
According to the applicants, however, this representation was not true.
It did not reflect Mr Schultz's actual state of mind at the time the directions were given.
The applicants submitted that the evidence supported a finding that Mr Schultz had not, at any time, reached a view that CPR Property ought to be prohibited (permanently) from being a subcontractor.
No one expressed any such opinion at the meetings Mr Schultz attended on 23 February and 18 and 19 March 2004.
All that officers of the Department intended was that Willowdene and Transfield not use CPR Property as a subcontractor pending the results of the investigation into AB.
A statement purporting to reflect an opinion will be misleading if it does not reflect the actual state of mind of the person in question ( James v ANZ Banking Group Limited (1986) 64 ALR 347 at 372: "[a] statement involving the state of mind of the maker of the statement, e.g.
promises, predictions and opinions, ordinarily conveys the meaning that the maker of the statement had a particular state of mind when the statement was made and that there was basis for that state of mind.
If the meaning contained in or conveyed by the statement is false in that or any other respect, there will have been [misleading and deceptive conduct]".
See also Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 88).
The applicants' alternative case is that the directions given pursuant to cl 16 also conveyed a representation that the Principal's Representative had a reasonable basis for the opinion that CPR Property was unsuitable such as to warrant CPR Property being prohibited from carrying out work on the Department's properties.
According to the applicants there was no reasonable basis for the opinion and thus the directions to Willowdene and Transfield (written and oral respectively) also were misleading and deceptive on this basis.
The respondents submitted that cl 16 of the head contracts permitted the Principal's Representative to form the decision in any way he liked, provided the opinion is "subjectively (that is honestly) reasonable".
Reasonableness must be informed by the objects of the Corporation, particularly as specified in ss 5 and 12 of the Housing Act .
The purpose of cl 16 should be understood as vesting in the Corporation a wide discretion to exclude from the State's properties any subcontractor that the Principal's Representative honestly regarded as unsuitable.
The directions say what they say.
They do not mention that the prohibition has any temporal dimension.
The directions, the respondents submitted, accurately reflected the fact that the Principal's Representative reasonably regarded CPR Property as unsuitable to perform the work because of its involvement in a pending investigation about CPR Property's association with a Departmental employee (AB).
At the time the directions were given, being the relevant time for assessment of the facts in issue ( City of Botany Bay Council v Jazabas Pty Limited [2002] ANZ ConvR 300; [2001] NSWCA 94 at [83] and McGrath and Honey as Joint Liquidators of Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Australian Naturalcare Products Pty Ltd (2008) 165 FCR 230 ; [2008] FCAFC 2 at [198] ), there were reasonable (indeed, ample) grounds supporting this state of mind.
The mere fact that an opinion may later turn out to be wrong does not prove that it was misleading or deceptive when conveyed ( Reiffel v ACN 075 839 226 Ltd (2003) 132 FCR 437 ; [2003] FCA 194 at [37]).
The respondents also submitted that Willowdene and Transfield took action to prohibit CPR Property from working as a subcontractor because of mere receipt of the directions and not because of any representation conveyed by the directions.
The applicants were not recipients of the directions and were not misled.
Hence, both aspects of the applicants' misleading and deceptive conduct case must fail.
Findings and discussion 
 Section 42 of the Fair Trading Act binds the Crown in right of the State of New South Wales insofar as the Crown in right of the State carries on a business, whether directly or by an authority of the State (s 3(1) of the Fair Trading Act ).
Under s 4 a business includes a business not carried on for profit, and a trade or profession.
The proscription in s 42 applies to a person in trade or commerce, engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.
Section 4 defines "trade or commerce" to include any business or professional activity.
The respondents accepted that the conduct in and in connection with the issuing of the directions to Willowdene and Transfield was done as part of carrying on a business and was in trade or commerce within the meaning of these provisions.
I accept that the provisions of the Housing Act are relevant to an assessment of the conduct of the Corporation and the Department, as is their status as public authorities.
As the respondents submitted, the Corporation and the Department are required to fulfil the objects of the Housing Act including those in s 5(1): 
 
 (a) to maximise the opportunities for all people in New South Wales to have access to secure, appropriate and affordable housing;
 ... 
 

 
 
 (f) to ensure that the public housing system focuses on housing people who are most in need;
 ... 
 

 
 
 (h) to maintain an efficient housing administration to ensure the effective co-ordination and provision of all housing services; 
 

 Section 5(2) of the Housing Act also provides as follows: 
 
 (2) In the administration of this Act, regard is to be had to the objects of this Act to the maximum extent possible taking into consideration the needs of the State and available resources, and subject to any directions of the Minister.

 

 I do not accept that the requirements of cl 16 are satisfied if the opinion of the Principal's Representative as to unsuitability of a subcontractor is "subjectively (that is honestly) reasonable" and no more.
The respondents' submissions in this regard were difficult to follow.
Their written submissions appeared to assert that cl 16 required nothing more than an honestly held view.
Their oral submissions, however, appeared to accept that cl 16 involved some objective element by reason of the word "reasonably" in the phrase "reasonably regards the ...subcontractor as incompetent, negligent or otherwise unsuitable".
Irrespective of this I am satisfied that cl 16 requires more than an honest opinion before the right to issue a direction arises.
A person's view is not reasonable merely because it is honestly held.
For example, an honest but capricious and arbitrary view is not a reasonable view.
A person reasonably regards some matter to be so where the opinion or view is reached by a process of reason.
The view must thus be rational having regard to the circumstances known to the person at the time.
Clause 16, accordingly, does not impose a particularly onerous standard.
By that provision the Corporation covenanted with the contractor to prohibit the use of certain subcontractors only if the Principal's Representative reasonably regarded the subcontractors as unsuitable on one or more of the nominated grounds.
The Corporation did not contract that this power would be exercised only if the Department had completed an investigation either at all or to a particular standard.
It did not contract that the power would be exercised only if the Principal's Representative reached the relevant state of mind by reference to any particular standard of proof.
An assessment of rationality (or reasonableness) must be undertaken recognising the statutory imperatives under which the Corporation and the Department operate and the commercial realities in which they exercise their functions.
The evidence discloses that the Department owns thousands of properties throughout NSW (about 7000 in the western area of metropolitan Sydney alone).
The properties are mostly tenanted to people on low incomes and various forms of income support.
The properties include single cottages, residential flat buildings and aged care facilities.
Some tenants look after their properties with the utmost care.
Some do not.
The properties frequently require maintenance, repairs and cleaning both when tenanted and between tenancies.
This includes rubbish removal, mowing and lawn maintenance, fencing maintenance, repainting, recarpeting, replacement of fixtures and fittings, as well as household cleaning generally.
Before June 2002 officers of the Department dealt directly with a wide variety of trade contractors.
Mr Hine was one of those trade contractors.
Before May 2002 he operated as a sole trader under the registered business name CPR Property Maintenance.
Although there was some debate about exactly when he started to work on the Department's properties, I am satisfied that Mr Hine started doing lawn mowing for the Department in or about 1989 (when the business name CPR Property Maintenance was registered).
At some time thereafter (but no later than the late 1990s) Mr Hine began doing cleaning and other small maintenance jobs on the Department's properties as well.
Mr Hine and the Department entered into contracts for the carrying out of this work on a two to three year basis.
One contract (which is in evidence) was dated 29 February 2000.
This contract was entered into after a tender process.
The tender documents show that Mr Hine sought work in the Western Sydney area as a sole trader operating under the business name CPR Property Maintenance.
On 3 February 2000 the Department identified Mr Hine as a contractor who had been "vacant cleaning for many years with the Department, and at the present time is working for team 3, who appear to be more than happy with CPR as a vacant cleaning contractor".
According to another Departmental document of about the same date Mr Hine "has worked only for the Department over the last five years" and was the subject of "very good feedback" from Departmental officers who were Mr Hine's referees.
The contract of 29 February 2000 between the Corporation (then constituted under the Housing Act 1985 (NSW)) and Mr Hine trading as CPR Property Maintenance was for the cleaning of vacant dwellings in an area known as WS07.
Under the contract the Department was not obliged to use Mr Hine as a contractor, the contract being a standing offer to carry out work at agreed rates as and when required (cl 8).
The contract was for a period of two years commencing 1 March 2000 (cl 10).
During the term of this contract the Department decided to streamline its procedures by minimising the number of contractors with which its officers had to deal.
To achieve this objective the Department decided that it would appoint contractors for each area.
It would enter into a contract with those contractors only.
The contractors would be responsible for carrying out the works or for arranging subcontractors to carry out the works.
The Department's officers would then have to deal with the contractors only.
Mr Hine became a subcontractor to one of the early contractors used by the Department, Haden FM Pty Ltd, in the period before the execution of the head contracts with Willowdene and Transfield (which commenced on 3 June 2002).
As part of this streamlining process Mr Hine was advised (perhaps by a Transfield or Willowdene representative) that he could not be a subcontractor to the Department unless he operated as a body corporate.
As a result of this advice CPR Property Pty Ltd was incorporated on 2 May 2002.
Given the diverse nature of the works required under the head contracts I infer that the Department and Corporation must have anticipated the almost routine use of subcontractors by the contractors.
I also infer that the Department and Corporation must have known that many of the trade contractors with whom it used to contract directly would continue to work on its properties as subcontractors.
Before finding certain other facts it is convenient to answer another question --- what were the representations conveyed by the directions?
The written direction to Willowdene is clear.
It is expressed to be in accordance with cl 16 of the general conditions of contract, the terms of which were known to Willowdene.
It is from the Principal's Representative (even though the power under cl 16 is vested in the Principal based on the state of mind of the Principal's Representative).
It prohibits Willowdene from using CPR Property in the performance of the works on the basis that the Principal's Representative reasonably regards CPR Property as unsuitable on account of its involvement in a pending investigation by the Department into its (that is, CPR Property's) association with a Departmental employee (AB) and certain allegations of misconduct arising therefrom (that is, from CPR Property's association with AB).
From this it may be concluded that the representations conveyed are as follows: 
(1) The Principal's Representative regarded CPR Property unsuitable to work as a subcontractor on the Department's properties.
(2) The view of the Principal's Representative was reasonable in all of the circumstances in the sense that it had been reached by a rational process and was founded on a rational basis.
(3) The rational basis was that the Department was undertaking an investigation into CPR Property's association with a Departmental employee and allegations of misconduct by the employee arising from that association.
(4) The Department had sufficient cogent information indicating the existence of an association (that is, by necessary implication, an improper association) between CPR Property and the unnamed Departmental employee such as to warrant the Principal's Representative prohibiting CPR Property from working on the Department's properties.
(5) The Department had sufficient cogent information indicating that the allegations of misconduct against its employee by reason of the association between CPR Property and the employee warranted the Principal's Representative prohibiting CPR Property from working on the Department's properties.
The oral direction to Transfield involves some disputed evidence.
In [24] above I referred to a report signed by Mr Schultz on 26 March 2004 recording that Mr Schultz advised Transfield's contract manager that "Transfield were not to use the services of CPR Property until further notice".
In his affidavit and oral evidence Mr Schultz (who had not checked all of the Department's records before preparing his affidavit) said that he informed Transfield's contract manager on 25 March 2004 about the investigation and asked whether Transfield was using CPR Property.
Transfield's contract manager said Transfield had not been using the services of CPR Property very much in the last five or six weeks and would not use them.
The report signed by Mr Schultz on 26 March 2004 (two days after the events in question) is likely to be more accurate than his recollection some five years later.
The report says that the call by Mr Schultz was made on 24 March 2004, the same day as the giving of the written direction to Willowdene.
This is more plausible than Mr Schultz's version in his affidavit of having made the call on 25 March 2004.
I am also satisfied that the version of the conversation in the report, in which Mr Schultz directed Transfield to the effect that CPR Property were prohibited from doing works on the Department's properties, is more plausible than the version in his affidavit.
I consider it likely that Mr Schultz made the call to Transfield with the benefit of the written direction to Willowdene either before him or at the forefront of his mind.
I infer that Mr Schultz would have been keen to communicate to Transfield the same direction as had been communicated to Willowdene, albeit one was in writing and the other oral.
Accordingly, I infer that Mr Schultz's discussion with the Transfield contract manager on 24 March 2004 conveyed the same or substantially the same information, and thus the same representations, as the written direction to Willowdene of the same date.
Were those representations misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive?
Two aspects of the respondents' submissions in answer to this claim may be dismissed immediately.
First, the fact that Willowdene and Transfield were bound to comply with the directions pursuant to cl 14 of the general conditions of contract does not mean that the only representation conveyed was that the direction was a direction under cl 16 and binding for the purpose of cl 14.
Willowdene and Transfield were only bound to comply with the direction under cl 14 if the direction was a direction that the head contract enabled the Principal's Representative to give.
Clause 16 only permitted the direction to be given in the circumstances specified in that clause.
The directions given thus conveyed the representations.
Willowdene and Transfield in fact immediately ceased to use CPR Property as a subcontractor on the Department's properties.
The representations conveyed caused Willowdene and Transfield to so cease using CPR Property as a subcontractor to perform maintenance on the Department's properties.
Second, the fact that the representations were made to Willowdene and Transfield rather than the applicants is beside the point.
A person may suffer loss and damage "by conduct of another person that is in contravention of" s 42 of the Fair Trading Act so as to engage a right to claim damages under s 68 of that Act whether the conduct is directed towards them or another person.
As set out in [1.82.17] and [1.82.18] of Russell V Miller.
Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act : Australian Competition and Consumer Law (30 th ed).
Thomson Reuters.
Sydney (2009) about the equivalent provisions of that Act (ss 52 and 82): 
 
 [1.82.17] Reliance: third party reliance 
 

 
 
 Neither s 82 nor s 87 requires that, in a case where the misleading or deceptive conduct involves a misrepresentation, the person who alleges damage must have relied on the misrepresentation.
All that is necessary is a sufficient and direct link between the loss or damage alleged to have been suffered and the misleading or deceptive conduct: McCarthy v McIntyre [1999] FCA 784 ; Finishing Services Pty Ltd v Lactos Fresh Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 177 ; Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 437 ; (1992) 37 FCR 526 ; 109 ALR 638 ; ATPR 41-186; Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Ltd [1998] HCA 69 ; (1998) 196 CLR 494 ; 158 ALR 333 ; 73 ALJR 12 ; ASAL 55-014; ATPR 41-665 at 359.

 

 
 
 [1.82.18] Must the claimant be misled?

 

 
 
 There must be a relevant nexus between the conduct complained of and at least some of the loss or damage suffered but this does not mean that it is always necessary for the claimant to prove that he personally relied on that conduct.
For example, where the misleading conduct involves passing off, the public may be misled thereby increasing the respondent's sales at the expense of the applicant.
In these circumstances the claimant may suffer loss or damage even though the claimant may never have been misled: see Janssen-Cilag Pty Ltd v Pfizer Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 437 ; (1992) 37 FCR 526 ; 109 ALR 638 ; ATPR 41-186; Hayes v Top Slice Deli Pty Ltd [1995] ATPR (Digest) 53 ,149 (46-147); Hill v Tooth  Co Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-649.

 

 Digi-Tech (Australia) Ltd v Brand (2004) 62 IPR 184 ; [2004] NSWCA 58 at [155] , referred to by the respondents, is not authority for any proposition contrary to the summary in [1.82.17] and [1.82.18] of Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act .
This is apparent from reading [155] of the NSW Court of Appeal's reasons in context.
Those reasons are as follows: 
 
 [ 155 ] Stockland (Constructors) Pty Ltd v Retail Design Group (International) Pty Ltd [[2003] NSWCA 84] followed the approach of Janssen-Cilag .
Stockland , like Janssen-Cilag , was not a case where the plaintiff claimed damage caused by entering into a transaction induced by misleading conduct.
In both cases the misleading conduct had caused others to act to the direct prejudice of the plaintiff.
That is to say, the chain of causation was as follows: firstly, misleading conduct by the defendant; secondly, an innocent party is induced by the misleading conduct to act in some way; thirdly, the innocent party's act, by its very nature, causes the plaintiff loss.
On this basis, no act of the plaintiff contributes to the loss.
The chain of causation is complete without there needing to be any act or omission on the part of the plaintiff.

 

 
 
 [ 156 ] The Janssen-Cilag and Stockland category of claim is materially different to that which occurs when plaintiffs suffer loss because they, themselves, are induced by misleading representations to perform some act or omission by which they are prejudiced.
The difference lies in the fact that in the first category of case no conduct on the part of the plaintiff forms a link in the causation chain.
In the second category, the inducement of the plaintiff and his or her act or omission causing loss is an essential part of the chain.
Without such inducement and a consequential act or omission on the part of the plaintiff there is indeed no linking chain between the misleading conduct and the plaintiff's loss.

 

 
 
 [ 157 ] This analysis demonstrates the fallacy of applying the so-called indirect theory of causation to this case.

 

 The facts of the present case are capable of fitting within the direct chain of causation theory posited in [155] of Digi-Tech , namely, "firstly, misleading conduct by the defendant [said to be the respondents in this case]; secondly, an innocent party [said to be Willowdene and Transfield in this case] is induced by the misleading conduct to act in some way; thirdly, the innocent party's act, by its very nature, causes the plaintiff [said to be the applicants in this case] loss.
On this basis, no act of the plaintiff contributes to the loss".
The respondents' primary answers to this claim --- that Mr Schultz held the views expressed in the directions at the time they were given and that those views were reasonably held in all of the circumstances at that time --- requires some further findings of fact and an assessment of the competing submissions in light of those findings.
I turn now to those further factual findings.
The concern about the Department's employee, AB, appears to have started with a complaint in April 2003 by another (anonymous) employee.
The anonymous complainant alleged that AB was operating inappropriately by directly arranging work with a subcontractor (CPR Property) before raising a work order.
This work was described as "untraceable".
The Department's Business Assurance Unit contacted the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) about the allegations in the same month, April 2003.
By the stage of contact with ICAC, the Department's Business Assurance Unit had received other information from other employees alleging that AB "over-serviced" properties (that is, arranged for work to be done that was not required).
Mark Lenic, the Department's manager of the area in which AB worked, prepared a memorandum dated 20 May 2003 attaching the observations of various employees about AB's work practices and an analysis of the works orders AB had raised.
By this stage a former employee of Willowdene (at this time mistakenly thought by Departmental officers to be a former employee of CPR Property) had also been in contact with a Department officer making various allegations about AB's work practices and AB's relationship with CPR Property.
Mr Lenic thus treated this information as "first hand knowledge" of some inappropriate conduct (which it was not).
Mr Lenic considered it clear from the material as a whole that "some wrongdoing" had occurred.
He referred to AB's Departmental mobile phone records showing a large number of calls from AB to Mr Hine which was contrary to the Department's code of conduct requiring communications to be with contractors only.
Mr Lenic recommended a full investigation by the Business Assurance Unit.
Under s 11(2) of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 (NSW) the principal officer of a public authority must report to ICAC "any matter that the person suspects on reasonable grounds concerns or may concern corrupt conduct".
By 26 June 2003 the Department's Director-General, its principal officer, had written to ICAC in accordance with s 11 about allegations that AB may be operating inappropriately by raising works orders in favour of CPR Property.
This report attached Mr Lenic's memorandum.
The Director-General requested that ICAC investigate the matter.
On 28 August 2003 the Director-General again wrote to ICAC informing it of a change of AB's role within the Department and that AB's works orders would be subject to a review by another employee.
ICAC also received reports and other material as brought into existence within the Department during ICAC's investigation.
This included reports by Noel Davidson, a Departmental employee, dated September 2003 and 20 October 2003.
In the former Mr Davidson tabulated the differences between original estimates and the final costs of works required by AB.
In the latter Mr Davidson compared his scoping of works required for certain properties to that of AB and identified a number of instances where AB's recommended works exceeded those Mr Davidson considered necessary.
The material also included a report of Brian Gore, a Departmental employee, dated 27 October 2003.
Like Mr Davidson, Mr Gore identified irregularities in AB's works orders such as including items under the wrong codes, apparently excessive numbers of certain items, use of wrong pay rates, and incorrect allocations of charges between the Department and its tenants.
The anomalies and irregularities observed by the Department were a cause for concern because they showed a pattern of costing the Department more money than the analysing officers considered necessary or reasonable.
As part of its investigation ICAC obtained documents from the Department and conducted interviews with or took statements from relevant employees and other persons.
ICAC interviewed Mr Lenic and Mr Davidson, amongst others.
ICAC also took a statement from Mr Gore.
In addition, ICAC conducted various covert surveillance operations.
ICAC's investigation concluded on 5 February 2004.
On that date ICAC forwarded a letter to the Department containing the following findings and conclusions: 
 
 COMMISSION INVESTIGATION FINDINGS 
 

 The Commission obtained no specific information confirming that [AB] is bypassing the head contractor, however, it has been established that [AB] has a close relationship with CPR.
A full audit of [AB's] finances has not revealed any unexplained income or identified that [AB] is living beyond his means.
The Commission has established that [AB] has a non-disclosed conflict of interest in that he has been working with/for CPR.
[AB's] exact role with CPR was not established, however, he was observed assisting in moving building materials at a DoH site with other CPR workers.
[AB's] telephone contact with CPR principle Mr. Robert Hind (sic) appears to be in direct contravention of departmental policy.
The Commission identified a number of occasions where [AB] has taken a departmental vehicle home for private use without authority.

 
 The Commission investigation established that there is insufficient evidence of either corrupt or criminal conduct and will not be conducting further inquiries in relation to this matter.

 

 
 
 The Commission has found that there may exist sufficient evidence to support departmental disciplinary action against AB.
Therefore, the matter is referred to the DoH for appropriate action.

 

 After ICAC referred the matter back to the Department it had a meeting with Susan Trudgett (then the new manager of the Department's Business Assurance Unit) on 18 February 2004.
Subsequently, the Department received materials that ICAC had gathered in its investigation.
The Department then had to deal with the issue of disciplinary action raised in the last paragraph of ICAC's letter.
Mrs Trudgett gave evidence in the proceeding.
Insofar as Mrs Trudgett's evidence indicated that the contents of that meeting were inconsistent with ICAC's written findings, the contents are hearsay, speculative, and inconsistent with the inference I draw that ICAC's written report fully and frankly sets out the results of its investigations.
Insofar as ICAC's findings involved Mr Hine and CPR Property it must also be noted that Mr Hine, in this proceeding, has given unchallenged evidence about the telephone calls from AB to him, the single day on which AB worked with CPR Property for work experience and AB's stepson working as an apprentice for CPR Property through a placement from the Housing Industry Association.
On 23 February 2004 officers of the Department, including Mrs Trudgett and Mr Schultz, attended a meeting.
At that stage Mrs Trudgett did not understand how AB was allegedly issuing "direct" works orders to CPR Property.
In fact, as is apparent from the evidence as a whole, this never occurred.
The attendees of the meeting also decided to retain Ernst  Young to provide advice before the Willowdene head contract was renewed.
The issue of how AB directly raised work orders was still on the table at a meeting that Mrs Trudgett (but not Mr Schultz) attended with Mr Lenic, Ray Hart and Leonie King (all Departmental officers) on 25 February 2004.
One further report was created within the Department after ICAC referred the matter back to the Department.
This is a report by Mr Gore dated 8 March 2004.
The report dealt with inspections of sites where Mr Gore considered the work orders showed excessive items.
As these sites involved Willowdene as the contractor, Mr Gore said that: 
 
 The QA Audit team has in its possession orders where work was ordered and no such work was needed or existed.

 

 
 
 As and example there is one property where 9 trees were ordered to be removed and there was no trees on site.
It is proposed that 10 orders of this type be audited under the above clause and all information and communication between Willowdene and their sub contractor be claimed and fully audited.

 

 
 
 There should be no difference between the order, claim, invoices from the sub contractor, payment to Willowdene and payment from Willowdene to the sub contractor.
If there is a difference and Willowdene paid the subcontractor for 6 trees and claimed 9 from the Department it becomes clear that the Contractor has had a "cut of the action".

 

 
 
 If however, there is a direct payment for the works without modification and the only difference is the % claimed for admin by Willowdene it can be reasonably stated that their poor auditing has left them exposed in this matter.

 

 
 
 I see no other way to clear this contractor of wrong doing in this matter.

 

 
 
 I realise that this course of action is drastic however there is no real way the external audit of the works can link the fraudulent behaviour to the Contractor.

 

 Mr Gore recommended that the Department's Business Assurance Unit engage a consultant auditor in order to finalise the matter.
Mrs Trudgett attended another meeting of Departmental officers (not including Mr Schultz) on 9 March 2004 referring to steps to gather evidence about the matter.
On 10 March 2004 the Department engaged Ernst  Young to report on AB in terms of how AB carried out his work, AB's relationship with Willowdene and AB's relationship with CPR Property as a subcontractor.
The letter said the Department anticipated that this matter would be the subject of future legal proceedings against either or all of AB, Willowdene and CPR Property.
Wayne Gilbert, a representative of Ernst  Young, attended another meeting of Departmental officers (not including Mr Schultz) on 10 March 2004 in which the Department identified its concerns about AB, Willowdene and CPR Property.
Departmental officers (but not Mr Schultz) met again on 12 March 2004.
On 15 March 2004 Mr Gilbert of Ernst  Young gave officers of the Department a briefing on Ernst  Young's investigation.
Mr Schultz was not at this briefing.
On the same day, 15 March 2004, the Department's internal solicitor, Antonino Calcopietro, sent an email which Mrs Trudgett read stating, amongst other things, that there appeared to be one works order for $80,000 warranting consideration.
This is a reference to a property known as 171 Stephen Street, Blacktown ( the Stephen Street property ).
Mr Calcopietro saw three possibilities: - (i) Willowdene did not know what was happening, (ii) Willowdene was an active participant in AB's conduct, or (iii) Willowdene was an inactive participant in AB's conduct.
Mr Calcopietro's email did not refer to CPR Property.
On 18 March 2004 Mrs Trudgett, Mr Schultz and Mr Gilbert met, along with other officers of the Department.
