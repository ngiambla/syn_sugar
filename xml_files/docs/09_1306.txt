 This matter was listed for hearing for four days commencing 7 September 2009, the proceedings having been commenced on 9 May 2008.
The pleadings were closed and the affidavit evidence should have been complete.
However, the parties agreed to vacate the days fixed for hearing because they were not in a position to meet the timetable for the filing of their evidence.
In addition, they agreed that the trial will probably take eight days and could not have been finished in the time allowed.
I have indicated that it would be possible, if new dates are reserved soon, for the case to be heard early next year.
In the meantime the parties agreed to use some of the time reserved for the hearing to deal with interlocutory matters.
There are three applications to be dealt with, which are presented for decision by notices of motion from both the applicant and the respondents.
The three matters which require the Court's adjudication are: an application by the applicant pursuant to s 64 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Evidence Act ") that it be allowed to rely on hearsay evidence of statements made by persons in the United Kingdom; an application by the applicant that one witness and another potential witness (each in the United Kingdom) be permitted to present themselves for cross-examination there by video link, rather than travelling to Australia; and an application by the respondent for further security for costs ($90,000 in security having earlier been ordered by consent).
Each application is contested.
There is one further order sought by the applicant's notice of motion which was not opposed and to which I will make further short reference in due course.
The nature of the proceedings
 The proceedings commenced by the applicant are founded on allegations that the respondents (individually or in combination) engaged in conduct which was misleading and deceptive, as to current and future matters, within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), that the first respondent breached two contracts made between it and the applicant on 22 May 2007, and that the applicant has suffered loss and damage as a result of the breaches alleged.
The applicant has claimed substantial damages as a result (of which approx $1,200,000 has so far been quantified).
