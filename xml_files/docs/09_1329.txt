 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court delivered on 27 August 2009, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal').
The Tribunal had affirmed the decisions of the first respondent's delegate not to grant the appellant a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa.
For the following reasons I would dismiss the appeal.
By way of background to this appeal, I note that the Tribunal accepted that the appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.
He arrived in Australia on 4 November 2000 as the holder of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) visa, and has since held various other student visas.
His most recent student visa was granted on 22 March 2005 and expired on 15 March 2007.
The Tribunal's reasons record that, on 14 March 2007, the appellant applied for a further Student (Temporary)(Class TU) visa making claims against subclass 572.
The delegate refused this application on 12 December 2007, upon the basis that the appellant had not satisfied the criteria for a student 572 visa, there being no evidence that: (1) overseas student health cover had been paid; (2) English proficiency requirements had been met; or (3) there were funds for support and payment of tuition fees.
On 3 January 2008, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
The Tribunal subsequently affirmed the delegate's decision.
The appellant filed an application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court, which was dismissed on 27 August 2009.
The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant met the English proficiency requirement and had sufficient health insurance.
Specifically: The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of subclause 572.223(2)(a)(i)(A) as contained in Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (' Migration Regulations ') because there was no evidence that the appellant completed an IELTS test pursuant to Items 5A407(a) or (b) in Schedule 5A.
Further, the Tribunal also found that the appellant had not provided evidence that he met the exceptions in Items 5A407(c) to (f).
The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of clause 572.225 as contained in Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations since the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had provided evidence of adequate arrangements for health insurance for the period of the appellant's intended stay in Australia.
As to the lack of evidence that he met the English proficiency requirement, the Tribunal noted: 
 
 At the hearing of the Tribunal on 3 September 2008, the visa applicant claimed that he had the evidence of meeting the English language requirement.
In his response to the Tribunal's letter, sent pursuant to section 359A, the visa applicant failed to provide evidence of having met the English language requirement.
He clearly did not have the relevant evidence when he attended the hearing.
The Tribunal is not required to delay making a decision on the prospect that the visa applicant may in the future provide evidence of having met the English language requirement.

 
 In the same vein, the Tribunal said, in relation to the health cover requirement, that: 
 
 At the hearing of the Tribunal on 3 September 2008, the visa applicant claimed that he had the evidence of the necessary health insurance.
He subsequently provided a letter dated 28 September 2008 from Medibank Private.
He clearly did not have this letter when he attended the hearing and has given no other evidence that he met the requirements for the health insurance prior to 28 September 2008.

 

 The Tribunal did not consider whether the appellant met the financial requirements in clause 572.223 of Schedule 2.
In the Federal Magistrates Court, according to the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment, the appellant raised four grounds, namely: The Tribunal failed to accept the appellant's evidence about his proficiency in English.
The Tribunal failed to accept the appellant's evidence about his health cover in Australia.

3.
The Tribunal failed to deal with the appellant's evidence about his finances.
The Tribunal failed to give sufficient time to produce the documentation that the appellant has now produced.

Each of these grounds was said to amount to jurisdictional error.
The Federal Magistrate rejected all of them.
The Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal had correctly determined that the appellant did not meet the English proficiency requirement because he neither provided evidence of an IELTS test pursuant to Items 5A407(a) or (b); nor did he meet the exceptions in Items 5A407(c), (d), (e) or (f).
The Federal Magistrate also held that the Tribunal's finding that the appellant did not satisfy the health insurance requirement was also "plainly correct".
The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant's third ground on the basis that, having made two findings, each of which was fatal to the application, the Tribunal was not obliged to consider the appellant's finances.
Finally, the Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal did not relevantly err in failing to allow the appellant further time.
Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the appellant's judicial review application.
The appellant appeals against his Honour's judgment on three grounds: 
 
 1.
Federal Magistrate Court [failed] to take all relevant evidence [into account];
 2.
[The] appellant had provided all documents at hearing; and 
 
 [The] appellant was granted leave to enter [this] country on [a] student visa and later rules change[d].
At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant and the first respondent relied on and augmented their written submissions.
Counsel for the appellant emphasized that the decision of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Kamal [2009] FCAFC 98 was inconsistent with a part of the reasons for judgment of the learned Federal Magistrate.
The appellant's counsel noted that the appellant had been living in Australia for nearly a decade and his position had altered because of changes in the criteria for student visas.
The appellant's counsel indicated that there had been some miscommunication with the Tribunal and that the appellant's former legal advisers had, or might have, given the appellant inadequate, even wrong, advice about what he need to do to obtain a student visa.
The appellant's counsel appealed to a discretion (which I do not have) to relieve the appellant of the consequences of what he termed any technical non-compliance with the 572 visa requirements.
CONSIDERATION 
 Clause 572.223 of Schedule 2 to the Migration Regulations sets out some of the criteria for a 572 visa.
Specifically, at the relevant time, clause 572.223 provided in part as follows: 
 
 (1) The Minister is satisfied that the applicant is a genuine applicant for entry and stay as a student because the applicant meets the requirements of subclause (2).
(2) An applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if:
 (a) for an applicant who is not a person designated under regulation 2.07AO: 
 (i) the applicant gives to the Minister evidence, in accordance with the requirements mentioned in Schedule 5A for Subclass 572 and the assessment level to which the applicant is subject, in relation to:
 (A) the applicant's English language proficiency for the purposes of each course of study that the applicant proposes to undertake; and
 (B) the financial capacity of the applicant to undertake each of those courses of study without contravening any condition of the visa relating to work; and
 (C) other requirements under Schedule 5A ...
.

 
 
 It is common ground that the appellant was not a person designated under regulation 2.07AO and therefore subclause 572.223(2) was applicable.
Thus, as at the date of the decision, the appellant was required to satisfy the Minister (or the Minister's delegate) that he met the requirements of subclause 572.223(2).
One of those requirements, contained in paragraph 572.223(2)(a)(i), was that he gave evidence in relation to his English language proficiency for the purposes of each course of study that he was proposing to undertake.
The evidence was to be given in accordance with the requirements mentioned in Schedule 5A and the assessment level to which he was subject.
The term "assessment level" was defined in regulation 1.03 to mean, in relation to a 572 visa, "the level of assessment (being level 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) specified under Division 1.8 for a kind of eligible passport, within the meaning of regulation 1.40 , and for an education sector".
Division 1.8 of the Regulations, which consisted of regs 1.40 to 1.44, contained special provisions for student visas.
Regulation 1.41(1) provided that the Minister must specify, in relation to each subclass of student visa, an assessment level to which an applicant for a student visa would be subject.
Under Regulation 1.44(1), an applicant for a student visa was required to give evidence about the applicant's English language proficiency in accordance with the requirements set out in Schedule 5A for the relevant subclass of visa and the assessment level to which the applicant was subject.
In accordance with the Regulations, the Minister specified in a Gazette Notice that a Bangladesh passport was one to which assessment level 3 applied, for applications for 572 visas lodged on or after 1 November 2004: see Commonwealth of Australia Gazette Notice GN 42, 26 October 2005 "Specification of Assessment Levels for Kinds of Eligible Passport In Relation to Subclasses of Student Visa for the Purposes of Regulation 1.41 of the Migration Regulations 1994 ".
The requirements for assessment at level 3 appeared in a number of items, but, for present purposes, it is enough to refer to Item 5A407.
Item 5A407 contemplated various possibilities.
One possibility was that contained in Item 5A407(a), which provided, relevantly, that an applicant must give evidence that the applicant: 
 
 (i) will not undertake an ELICOS before commencing his or her principal course; and
 (ii) achieved, in an IELTS test that was taken less than 2 years before the date of the application, an Overall Band Score of at least 5.5.
