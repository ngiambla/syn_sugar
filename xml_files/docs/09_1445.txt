 INTRODUCTION 
 On 27 March 2009, the primary judge delivered judgment in relation to an appeal by Television Food Network, G.P ("Television") against a decision of a delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks dismissing Television's opposition to the application by Food Channel Network Pty Ltd ("Channel") to register Trade Mark No 967804 ("the Trade Mark"): [2009] FCA 271.
The primary judge found in Television's favour and ordered that the registration of the Trade Mark be refused.
Channel was also ordered to pay Television's costs.
LEAVE TO APPEAL IS REQUIRED 
 Channel now seeks leave to appeal that decision.
Leave is required under s 195(2) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Act") where the proposed appeal is against a judgment of a single judge of this Court.
Section 25(2)(a) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides that applications for leave to appeal may be heard and determined by a single judge, or by a Full Court.
However, O 52 r 2AA provides that an application under s 25(2) must be heard and determined by a single judge unless a judge directs it be heard by a Full Court, or a Full Court is already seized of the matter and considers it appropriate to hear and determine the application.
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH IN DETERMINING WHETHER LEAVE SHOULD BE GRANTED UNDER S 195(2) OF THE ACT?

 In their outline of submissions, both counsel, Mr Stephens for Channel and Mr Franklin SC for Television, submitted that on an application for leave of this kind, the applicant must show a " clear prima facie error " on the part of the primary judge.
In support of this submission, both counsel referred to the Full Court decision of Woolworths Ltd v BP Plc (2006) 150 FCR 134 ; [2006] FCAFC 52 (" Woolworths ") at [53] --- [56].
Then, both counsel appeared to submit differing alternative approaches.
Mr Stephens submitted, in the alternative, that leave should be granted if there is an important question of law involved, relying upon the Full Court decision in Kenman Kandy Australia Pty Ltd v Registrar of Trade Mark [2002] FCAFC 273.
For his part, Mr Franklin SC submitted that " at the very least " an applicant for leave needed to show that the appeal was reasonably arguable, or that there was sufficient doubt to warrant consideration of the matter by a Full Court.
Having considered these submissions and the relevant authorities on the issue, I have concluded that, in the circumstances of this matter, I should not adopt the "prima facie error of law " approach, but instead I should take the approach outlined in the Full Court decision of Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 (" Decor Corp ") particularly at 398 --- 399.
That approach is similar, in part, to the alternative approach outlined by Mr Franklin SC immediately above.
My reasons for reaching this conclusion are as follows.
I begin by noting that about eight months after Woolworths was delivered, a differently constituted Full Court in Pfizer Corporation v Commissioner of Patents (2006) 155 FCR 578 ; [2006] FCAFC 190 (" Pfizer ") rejected a submission from counsel that the majority in Woolworths had held that the general rule or principle governing leave was that the applicant had to show " clear prima facie error in the reasons of the primary judge ": see Pfizer at [7].
Instead, after reviewing various decisions on the point, the Court held that the discretion to grant leave to appeal must not be constrained by rigid rules, or rules of general application, but each application was to be considered on its own special circumstances: see Pfizer at [10].
However, the Court did, then, appear to approve the " clear prima facie error " approach where the applicant for leave had been unsuccessful after two hearings and questions of fact, impression and judgment were involved: see Pfizer at [12].
Then, in The Scotch Whiskey Association v De Witt [2008] FCA 73 (" Scotch Whiskey "), Jessup J observed that the Full Court decisions in Woolworths and Pfizer appeared to have been argued prior to the insertion of r 2AA in O 52 of the Federal Court Rules at [17].
As noted above, r 2AA (which came into operation on 9 August 2005) provides that, with some exceptions that are not relevant for present purposes, an application for leave to appeal under s 25(2)(a) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) must be heard and determined by a single judge.
Thus both those decisions appeared to involve a situation where the applications for leave to appeal were dealt with by a Full Court, rather than a single judge: see Scotch Whiskey at [17].
Flowing from this observation, Jessup J gave a compelling reason why the appropriate approach on an application for leave to appeal may be otherwise after r 2AA was introduced.
He observed that while it may be easy, in an appropriate case, for a Full Court to conclude that a judgment of a single judge of the Court was attended by " clear prima facie error ", it would be inappropriate for one single judge of the Court to express the same conclusion about the judgment of another single judge of the Court: see Scotch Whiskey at [16].
Ultimately, in the exercise of his discretion, Jessup J decided not to take the " clear prima facie error " approach, but instead his Honour applied the approach laid down by the Full Court in Decor Corp : see Scotch Whiskey at [19].
That approach involves two steps as follows: 
(a) whether there is sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration of the matter by a Full Court; and
 
(b) whether the denial of an opportunity to appeal would involve a substantial injustice supposing the decision of the primary judge to have been wrong.
It is clear from these decisions that I have a broad discretion as to which approach I decide to take in this matter.
I should say at once that I am uncomfortable, as a single judge of this Court, adopting the " clear prima facie error " approach in deciding whether leave should be given to appeal the decision of another single judge of this Court.
Moreover, identifying a clear prima facie error seems to me to invite a more searching consideration of the merits of the appeal than should occur at this stage of the proceedings: compare with the " rough and ready " approach suggested by Brennan CJ and McHugh J in Jackamarra v Krakouer [1998] HCA 27 ; (1998) 195 CLR 516 at [9] , albeit directed to an extension of time to appeal.
Instead, the Decor Corp approach adopted by Jessup J has the advantage that it does not require me to identify clear error on the part of the primary judge, but rather to assess whether there is the necessary combination of sufficient doubt about the decision and the existence of substantial injustice (if leave were not granted), to justify the matter being considered by a Full Court.
Furthermore, the Decor Corp approach requires that the sufficiency of the doubt and the extent of the potential injustice involved be balanced against each other and not be " isolated in separate compartments " so that " the degree of doubt which is sufficient in one case may be different from that required in another ": see Decor Corp at 399.
Thus a more stringent approach is taken to a decision involving a point of practice, than one determining a substantive right, such that in the latter case, leave is more readily granted: see Decor Corp at 400.
Jessup J made some similar observations in relation to applications for leave to appeal under s 195 of the Act in the Scotch Whiskey case.
There, his Honour noted a submission of counsel that contrasted the situation where the applicant for leave had had two previous unsuccessful hearings in relation to the trade mark, with that where an applicant had had one prior success and one prior failure.
While his Honour did not specifically adopt counsel's submission, Jessup J provided two reasons why clear prima facie error (ie significant doubt) may be appropriate in the former situation , observing that: " The basis for this approach, it seems, is twofold: first, the opponent has had two full hearings on the merits, and has achieved the same result each time; and secondly, a disappointed opponent may in any event apply for cancellation of the registration of the mark under s 88 of the Act ": see Scotch Whiskey at [13].
By contrast, in relation to the latter situation, Jessup J appeared to agree with counsel's submission that leave should only be refused if: "... the court is satisfied that it is clear beyond doubt that there is no error on the part of the trial Judge ", observing that: " No doubt the basis for that proposition is that, once having been rejected in the Court, the owner's application for registration would be permanently at an end ": see Scotch Whiskey at [13].
I respectfully agree with those observations and I consider they are directly referable to this case, which involves the latter situation.
If leave is not granted to Channel, that will mean its application for registration of the Trade Mark will be at an end, or, in other words, its substantive rights will have been finally determined.
On this point, I reject the submission made by Mr Franklin SC that Channel could simply file a new application.
While this may be correct in theory, because of the findings made by the primary judge, I consider that a new application in substantially the same form would face very significant, if not insurmountable, difficulties.
It follows from all this that I consider a small amount of doubt about the trial judge's decision should suffice in this case given the substantial injustice that Channel will suffer if leave were refused and its substantive rights were thereby finally determined on the basis of the primary judge's decision.
BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 Before I consider whether the requisite level of doubt exists about the primary judge's decision in this matter, I need to set out some of the background facts and the procedural history in order to provide some context.
Food Channel Pty Ltd ("Food Channel"), a related entity to Channel, filed the application for the Trade Mark on 28 August 2003.
The application described Food Channel as the owner of the Trade Mark.
It also described the goods and class to which the Trade Mark related in the following terms: " Goods specification: Class 16: printed matter, periodical publications, books and newspapers; paper and cardboard articles; posters, calendars; writing instruments, pencils, pens, stationery, writing pads, greeting cards; photographs ".
On 20 January 2004, Food Channel assigned its application to register the Trade Mark, to Channel.
Following the application being advertised for opposition, Television lodged a notice of opposition.
Before the delegate of the Registrar, Television pursued three grounds of opposition: Channel did not intend to use the Trade Mark (s 59) ; the Trade Mark was likely to deceive or cause confusion (s 43) ; and the Trade Mark was deceptively similar to Television's trade marks (s 44).
On 29 November 2006, the delegate rejected all of Television's grounds of opposition and decided to proceed to register the Trade Mark.
As is already noted above, Television then appealed to the Federal Court on the same three grounds, and it added three additional grounds.
The additional grounds were: Channel was not the owner of the Trade Mark (s 58) ; the Trade Mark was scandalous or its use was contrary to law (s 42) ; and the Trade Mark was similar to Television's trade mark that had acquired a reputation in Australia (s 60).
Television subsequently abandoned its reliance upon s 43.
In the lead-up to the trial of the matter, the primary judge conducted a number of directions hearings at which orders were made about the filing of affidavit evidence, the discovery of documents and the filing and service of written submissions.
Among other things, both parties therefore subsequently filed and served a number of affidavits upon which they intended to rely.
Throughout these pre-trial processes, Mr Paul Lloyd Lawrence (the sole director of Channel and Food Channel) acted for Channel.
He did so by leave of the primary judge.
However, the primary judge made it clear to Mr Lawrence from the outset that his leave to appear for Channel did not extend to the pre-trial mediation, or to the trial itself.
For those stages of the proceedings, he was required to acquire legal representation for Channel.
Shortly before the trial, Mr Lawrence retained counsel and solicitors to act for Channel.
At the commencement of the trial on 17 March 2008, Channel's counsel sought to file and rely upon a fourth affidavit of Mr Lawrence sworn on 16 March 2008.
The primary judge allowed Channel to file this affidavit and then heard submissions as to whether it should be permitted to rely on it.
It should, perhaps, be noted that Channel also sought to file and rely upon a fifth affidavit, however that affidavit is not relevant in this application.
The primary judge refused to give Channel leave to rely upon the fourth (or the fifth) affidavit and published reasons for that ruling (see [2008] FCA 378).
The trial was then completed with Channel having to rely upon the three affidavits that had been prepared and filed by Mr Lawrence.
THE PRIMARY JUDGE'S DECISION 
 As I have already noted above, the primary judge found for Television.
