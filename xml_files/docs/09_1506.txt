 The question posed by these proceedings is whether a debit card with additional functions is "... a card of the same kind" when it is provided by a bank to an existing customer in substitution for his or her existing debit card with less functions.
This involves the proper construction of s 12DL of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) .
THE FACTUAL CONTEXT 
 (a) Handycards
 Westpac Banking Corporation is one of the larger banks in Australia.
In early 2009 it had on issue to its customers and their nominees over 2,500,000 debit cards, called Westpac Handycards.
Westpac first issued Handycards in the early 1980s as a proprietary debit card.
These were used to access funds in a customer's account with Westpac.
Handycards are always used by the cardholder entering a personal identification number, known as a "PIN", into either an Australian electronic funds transfer point of sale (known as "EFTPOS") machine or terminal or into an automatic teller machine (known as an "ATM") both domestically and internationally.
Ordinarily, when a customer uses his or her Handycard in an EFTPOS or ATM transaction, he or she is linked, through computer networks, into his or her account at Westpac.
The customer then uses his or her PIN and draws on funds within, either, a credit balance or an approved overdraft limit to pay a supplier at its premises using EFTPOS, for goods or services or to obtain cash using either EFTPOS or an ATM.
The Handycards work in ATMs internationally because they function on the Cirrus system.
This is a global ATM system operated by the MasterCard group.
Cirrus links more than 20,000 financial institutions through 1.5 million ATMs in over 210 countries.
(b) Debit MasterCards
 Westpac identified about 900,000 of its Handycard customers who had a higher propensity to use their card in EFTPOS transactions.
It decided to substitute a new card for those customers' Handycards.
This was to be a Westpac Debit MasterCard.
Westpac began sending the new card to its existing customers in early February 2009.
It wrote telling them that the Handycard would expire and would be replaced with the new card that was enclosed.
The letters differed depending on whether the Handycard was close to expiring in the ordinary course.
Each letter enclosed a product disclosure statement for the new card dated 1 December 2008.
The new card allows the customer to do what he or she did with their Handycard.
However, the new card also has additional functions and can be used to access the customer's account in different ways to those with a Handycard.
The Commission asserts that these differences mean that the new card is not "a card of the same kind" as the Handycard.
The consequence of this argument is that Westpac will have committed criminal offences by sending debit cards to the over 424,000 Handycard holders who had received the new card by late May 2009.
The Commission had first raised a concern of a possible contravention of s 12DL in a letter it sent to Westpac on 12 May 2009.
After this the parties engaged in correspondence and meetings.
Ultimately, on 6 August 2009, the Commission wrote to Westpac with the accusation that distribution of the new card to Westpac's Handybank customers "... is a clear breach of s 12DL ...".
Westpac brought these proceedings seeking declarations that, in effect, what it had done was not a contravention of s 12DL.
Following a number of directions hearings in which the Commission sought to identify the precise contravention of s 12DL that it alleged, it filed a cross-claim that pleaded the matters on which it relied.
Westpac's defence to the cross claim narrowed the substance of the factual dispute which I will summarise below.
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A HANDYCARD AND A DEBIT MASTERCARD 
 Two detailed affidavits were made by Scott Southall, Westpac's general manager, deposits, cards and merchants.
These explained the operation of the two types of card and the individual and commercial contexts in which they are used.
Mr Southall also set out the evolutionary development of functionality and applications for the two types of card that has occurred in response to developments in technology, regulation, financial and banking systems.
He explained, for example, that in 1980 when ATMs were first used, a cardholder could only gain access to his or her account by using an ATM of the card issuer.
This is a constraint on usage unrecognisable in today's world.
Now, banks and other financial networks, including MasterCard, have established linkages and networks that give cardholders of one issuing financial institution access to their accounts on ATMs and EFTPOS machines including those of many other financial institutions throughout Australia, and to many ATMs internationally.
Mr Southall said that payment systems are continually evolving.
There is no factual dispute about the differences between the functions of the Handycard and those of the new card.
The real issue is the proper construction of s 12DL in light of these differences.
