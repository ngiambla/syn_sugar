 In this application, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the "Authority") seeks declarations as to contraventions by the respondent, Mr Atkinson, of s 16(1) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (the " Spam Act "), injunctions restraining Mr Atkinson from engaging in contravening conduct in the future and an order for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty in respect of the contended contraventions.
The application was listed for final hearing and determination on the footing that the parties have reached agreement as to the facts giving rise to contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act and, subject to discretionary considerations, the parties are agreed as to the formulation of the proposed declarations and injunctions to be made.
In addition, the parties have reached agreement as to the pecuniary penalty they jointly submit the Court ought to order having regard to all of the statutory considerations going to that question.
Those matters are supported by extensive written joint submissions filed by the parties and supplementary written submissions in relation to additional matters to be mentioned later in these reasons.
Mr Atkinson admits the contraventions alleged against him, based on the agreed facts.
The joint submissions go beyond simply questions of fact and extend to joint submissions as to matters relevant to the exercise of the power to impose a pecuniary penalty.
The agreed facts, extracted from the joint written submissions, are these: 
 
 Facts 
 

 The material facts relied on and the details of the conduct the subject of the proceedings are set out in the statement of claim and below.
Between approximately 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007, Mr Atkinson operated a business, under the name "Sancash", which promoted various herbal products, adult products, and replica watches (the Sancash products ), by means of unsolicited email messages (the spam emails ) sent by a series of approximately 45 recruited individuals (the Sancash affiliates ).
If a recipient purchased a Sancash product as a result of the spam emails sent by a Sancash affiliate, Mr Atkinson received a commission payment from the supplier of the product, and in turn paid a commission to the Sancash affiliate.
A spam email sent by a Sancash affiliate would contain an internet link through which the recipient of the spam email could order a promoted product.
Sancash affiliates were allocated their own specific internet links to include in the spam emails that they sent.
This enabled a Sancash affiliate to be identified in relation to a particular purchase and for a commission to be paid.
The operation of the Sancash business between October 2006 and December 2007 involved the sending of millions of spam emails worldwide by Sancash affiliates.
Mr Atkinson did not personally send the spam emails.
Mr Atkinson caused the emails to be sent as he: 
 
 
 12.1 managed and operated the Sancash business, including recruiting Sancash affiliates, communicating with them electronically, monitoring their sales, paying commissions to them, and providing customer support services for orders generated by the Sancash affiliates, including responding to customer queries; 
 

 
 
 12.2 established and provided, or caused to be established and provided, to the Sancash affiliates internet domain names (including causing to be established and provided the domain names in Attachment 1 to these submissions) and website templates through which they were able to direct sales in the spam emails; and 
 

 
 
 12.3 created and provided, or caused to be created and provided, particular subject lines for use in the spam emails, to assist in avoiding automatic spam filters.
Subject lines that Mr Atkinson caused to be created and provided, by a subordinate, include the subject lines in Attachment 2 to these submissions.

 

 The spam emails were sent for the purpose of offering to supply, or promoting, the Sancash products, and were accordingly commercial electronic messages within the meaning of that expression in s.6 of the Spam Act .
The spam emails did not fall within the exception in s.16(1)(b) of the Spam Act for "designated commercial messages", as defined in Schedule 1 of the Spam Act , as they contained content other than factual information, being a promotional message in relation to the Sancash products.
The spam emails were sent to persons including recipients in Australia, and included messages accessed using computers, servers or devices located in Australia, and messages sent to electronic account-holders who were individuals physically present in Australia when the emails were accessed.
Such emails had an Australian link within the meaning of that expression in s.7 of the Spam Act .
This proceeding is confined to the conduct of Mr Atkinson in causing to be sent those spam emails which had an Australian link (the Australian spam emails ).
Mr Atkinson says that he requested some new affiliates not to send the email messages to some Australian email addresses.
Mr Atkinson did not retain any records of such communications and the records produced by him or otherwise obtained by the ACMA do not contain any of these statements.
The precise terms of Mr Atkinson's requests accordingly cannot be specified.
Mr Atkinson admits that he gave no instruction or direction that would be capable of ensuring no Australian address received the spam emails and he in fact observed that orders were received from Australian customers.
Mr Atkinson also did not take effective steps to check whether such instructions as may have been given about Australian addresses were complied with.
He also suspected, but did not check, that at least one of the affiliates was based in Australia.
Attachment 3 to these submissions is a CD of emails identified by the applicant as Australian spam emails sent by the Sancash affiliates, and caused to be sent by Mr Atkinson, during the period between 18 October 2007 and 17 December 2007.
The emails are extracted from a database maintained by the applicant, referred to as the "SpamMatters database", through which members of the public in Australia are able to report, and forward to the ACMA, unsolicited commercial emails received at their email accounts.
The extracted emails contained in Attachment 3 comprise those from the ACMA's SpamMatters database which incorporated one of the domain names identified at Attachment 1 as created by the respondent.
There are 140,789 emails extracted in the attached disk.
They consist of the following numbers of emails sent on each day listed below: 
 Date Number of Emails Date Number of Emails 18 October 2007 3045 18 November 2007 1899 19 October 2007 4156 19 November 2007 2522 20 October 2007 2815 20 November 2007 2721 21 October 2007 1406 21 November 2007 2069 22 October 2007 3748 22 November 2007 2135 23 October 2007 2744 23 November 2007 2398 24 October 2007 2732 24 November 2007 2444 25 October 2007 2830 25 November 2007 2471 26 October 2007 2785 26 November 2007 2659 27 October 2007 2679 27 November 2007 2056 28 October 2007 2093 28 November 2007 2525 29 October 2007 2294 29 November 2007 3164 30 October 2007 3929 30 November 2007 2605 31 October 2007 2718 1 December 2007 2479 1 November 2007 1744 2 December 2007 2124 2 November 2007 2460 3 December 2007 2724 3 November 2007 1858 4 December 2007 4628 4 November 2007 3247 5 December 2007 3083 5 November 2007 2562 6 December 2007 2231 6 November 2007 2058 7 December 2007 2028 7 November 2007 1429 8 December 2007 1594 8 November 2007 1076 9 December 2007 1381 9 November 2007 971 10 December 2007 1522 10 November 2007 616 11 December 2007 1368 11 November 2007 1550 12 December 2007 1274 12 November 2007 1696 13 December 2007 3056 13 November 2007 2225 14 December 2007 2887 14 November 2007 2192 15 December 2007 1354 15 November 2007 2673 16 December 2007 872 16 November 2007 2699 17 December 2007 911 17 November 2007 2575 
 
 
 
 
 20.
As these constitute only the emails which both: 
 

 
 
 20.1 were formally reported to the applicant by members of the public in Australia; and 
 

 
 
 20.2 fall within the limitations described at paragraph 18 above; 
 

 
 
 the ACMA submits, and Mr Atkinson accepts, that these emails are likely to represent only a small proportion of the total number of Australian spam emails with an Australian link actually sent by the Sancash affiliates, and which Mr Atkinson caused to be sent.

 

 On or about 17 December 2007, premises of an associate of Mr Atkinson who was apparently involved in the Sancash operations, Mr Roland Smits, were subject to searches by regulatory authorities in New Zealand and computer equipment was seized.
The pleaded conduct occurred up to the time of that intervention.
The ACMA alleges, and Mr Atkinson admits, that by engaging in the conduct pleaded in the statement of claim, between approximately 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007, he caused to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages, which had an Australian link, in contravention of s.16(1) of the Spam Act .
It can be seen from the agreed facts that between 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007 Mr Atkinson operated a business called "Sancash" which promoted the sale of herbal products, adult products and replica watches by means of unsolicited email messages sent by approximately 45 recruited individuals who were paid a commission by Mr Atkinson.
The joint submission also adopts the statement of claim in the proceeding filed on 21 October 2009 that describes the products as herbal products promoted or supplied by Genbucks Limited, adult sex toys supplied or promoted by Genbucks Limited and watches branded "King Replica".
The spam emails sent by Sancash affiliates contained an internet link to a website from which a product could be purchased.
The operation of the Sancash business between the relevant dates involved the sending of millions of spam emails worldwide by Sancash affiliates.
Mr Atkinson caused the emails to be sent.
As the emails were sent for the purpose of offering to supply or promote Sancash products, they were "commercial electronic messages" within the meaning of that term in s 6 of the Spam Act and they did not fall within the exception in s 16(1)(b) of the Spam Act .
The spam emails were sent to recipients in Australia using computers, servers or devices located in Australia and thus the conduct of Mr Atkinson had, at all relevant times, what is described as an "Australian link" for the purposes of s 7 of the Spam Act .
The period of the contravening conduct was almost 14 months in all.
As the agreed facts make clear, millions of spam emails were sent by Sancash affiliates "worldwide" although these proceedings are confined to the conduct of Mr Atkinson in causing unsolicited commercial electronic messages to be sent which had an Australian link.
The parties agree that over a period of 61 days, 140,789 emails that were caused to be sent by Mr Atkinson were formally reported to the Authority by members of the public in Australia.
The emails incorporated as points of supply one of the many domain names identified at Attachment 1 to the joint submissions.
Attachment 1 consists of a 10-page document comprising five columns of domain names.
There are approximately 2,090 domain names recited in Attachment 1.
Mr Atkinson accepts that the 140,789 emails are likely to represent only a small proportion of the total number of Australian spam emails with an Australian link actually sent by the Sancash affiliates and which Mr Atkinson caused to be sent (para 20 of the agreed submissions).
At para 12.3 of the agreed submissions, Mr Atkinson accepts that an element of causing the emails to be sent involved his conduct in causing to be created and provided, particular subject lines called "ManSter/VPXL Subject Lines", for use in spam emails so as to attempt to prevent automatic spam filters detecting and deflecting unsolicited commercial electronic messages.
Accordingly, it is common ground that all of the integers of s 16 are made out and Mr Atkinson has sent or caused to be sent a commercial electronic message that has an Australian link and is not a designated commercial electronic message for the purposes of the Spam Act .
Section 24 of the Spam Act is in these terms: 
 
 24.
Pecuniary penalties for contravention of civil penalty provisions 
 

 
 
 (1) If the Federal Court is satisfied that a person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such pecuniary penalty, in respect of each contravention, as the Court determines to be appropriate.

 

 
 
 (2) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including: 
 

 
 
 (a) the nature and extent of the contravention; and 
 

 
 
 (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and 
 

 
 
 (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; 
 

 
 
 (d) whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct; and 
 

 
 
 (e) if the Court considers that it is appropriate to do so --- whether the person has previously been found by a court in a foreign country to have engaged in any similar conduct.

 

 The maximum penalties for contraventions of s 16 of the Spam Act are set out in s 25 of the Spam Act .
For a person who is an individual and who has not been previously found to have contravened the Spam Act , the maximum penalty prescribed by s 25(4) is 20 penalty units in respect of a contravention of s 16(1) ; or if the Federal Court finds that the person has, on a particular day, committed two or more contraventions of s 16(1) , the total penalties payable under s 24(1) by the person in respect of those contraventions must not exceed 400 penalty units.
A penalty unit is defined in s 4 of the Spam Act as having the meaning given by s 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides that a penalty unit is $110.00.
Accordingly, the maximum applicable penalty for each of the 61 days on which more than one contravention is admitted and found by the Court to have occurred, is $44,000.00.
The maximum penalty in respect of the contraventions admitted over the 61 days set out in the schedule at para 19 of the joint submission quoted at [5], is $2,684,000.00.
By para 35 of the joint submission, the parties contend that on the basis of the principles, factors and circumstances set out in the submission, it is appropriate that the Court impose upon Mr Atkinson in respect of the contraventions across the period of the 61 days, a single pecuniary penalty in an amount of $210,000.00.
This represents a pecuniary penalty of 7.82% of the maximum penalty prescribed by s 25 of the Spam Act .
As to the five criteria identified in s 24 of the Spam Act , the parties jointly make these submissions.
First, the Sancash spamming activity caused by Mr Atkinson was " deliberate , extensive , and occurred over a lengthy period" [emphasis added].
The parties agree that in view of the admissions made by Mr Atkinson as to the conduct, the authority does not seek to adduce evidence as to the likely numbers of spam emails with an Australian link that Mr Atkinson caused to be sent over the full period of the contraventions, namely, 14 months.
At para 46, the parties jointly say: 
 
 ...
However, the parties jointly submit that it is a relevant consideration that the contravening conduct occurred over a significantly longer period than the 61 day period in relation to which a selection of detailed email records is provided.

 

 The parties also say at para 47: 
 
 Mr Atkinson is not able to estimate the volume of emails he caused to be sent by the Sancash affiliates to persons in Australia.
It should be noted that those emails contained in the attachment to these submissions comprise only those reported to the ACMA by members of the public.
That this sample represents such a significant number of emails reported per day indicates that the extent of the conduct and volume of emails was very high .
[emphasis added] 
 

 At para 48 of the joint submissions the parties agree that the nature and extent of the contravening conduct is an aggravating factor in this case [emphasis added].
Although the nature and extent of any loss caused by the sending of the unsolicited commercial electronic messages is not quantifiable, the parties jointly submit that the Court should have regard to the Explanatory Memorandum (the "EM") circulated by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, upon the introduction of the Spam Bill 2003 to the House of Representatives, addressing the international problem affecting the efficient operation of internet telecommunications networks by reason of spam emails and the costs imposed on end-users.
The Court is directed to the following passage from the EM: 
 
 The dollar cost of spam is inherently difficult to estimate, but the following provides some appreciation of the orders of magnitude involved.
