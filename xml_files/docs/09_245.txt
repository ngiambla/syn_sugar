 This proceeding concerns one aspect of the introduction of a new fisheries management regime to the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (the ETBF or the Fishery).
On 24 May 2005, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (the Authority or AFMA) determined the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery Management Plan (the Management Plan) for the Fishery.
An amending Management Plan was determined on 19 April 2007.
When the Management Plan was determined, the applicants held a number of fishing permits packages, each entitling them to fish in a number of zones of the Fishery, including Area E, a coastal zone of the Fishery around Cairns and Townsville, from approximately Shelbourne Bay to Proserpine.
Section 32 of the Management Plan effected the allocation of Statutory Fishing Rights (SFRs) in the Fishery.
The applicants in these proceedings challenge the validity of item 5 of s 32 of the Management Plan.
Section 32 is a small component of the Management Plan.
The Management Plan is a statutory instrument, with the consequence that it, or any part of it, cannot be reviewed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (the ADJR Act).
The test for validity of a legislative instrument is "whether there is a 'real connection' between the delegated legislation and the purpose for which the Parliament conferred the authority to make the law under challenge": Gummow J in Bienke v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1994) 125 ALR 151 at 163.
The applicant contends that the "Relative Price Factor" derived for a fishing permit package for the northern inshore and Area E areas of the Fishery in item 5 in the table in s 32 of the Management Plan was derived by a method that was irrational, unreasonable and capricious, and was against the weight of evidence and submissions to the Authority, with the consequence that item 5 should be declared invalid.
For the reasons which follow, the applicants' challenge to s 32 of the Management Plan fails, and the declaration of invalidity they seek will be refused.
