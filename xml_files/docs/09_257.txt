 Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") instituted proceedings under ss 459A , 459B , 459P and 464 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act") seeking to wind up Bowesco Pty Ltd on the ground of its presumed insolvency by virtue of s 459C of the Act as a receiver and manager was appointed to it by Suncorp Metway Limited on 3 March 2006 pursuant to a floating charge.
Bowesco is the trustee of the Dyson Family Trust whose principal beneficiaries are the children of Mr Norman Carey.
A trial was conducted before me between 25 and 27 March and on 11 April 2008.
At that time I reserved judgment.
Between then and 1 September 2008, Bowesco filed several affidavits seeking to adduce further evidence.
One of these sworn by Ms Karen Sandra Carey on 1 September 2008, annexed a copy of a Deed of Release by Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd , in respect of a debt of $1,055,959 owed to it by Bowesco.
This evidence comes more than 2 years after the proceedings commenced and nearly 5 months from the date that judgment was reserved.
ASIC has conceded that by reason of the receipt into evidence of the Richstar Deed of Release that Bowesco was likely to be able to prove its solvency.
I granted ASIC leave to discontinue on this ground on 3 September 2008.
The only question which I am asked to resolve concerns costs.
ASIC submits that, but for the belated receipt into evidence of the Richstar Deed of Release, it would have succeeded in the application.
It seeks the costs of the application including costs in the cause, reserved costs and costs where there was ordered a liberty to apply.
Costs principles
 The position in this case is somewhat unusual.
Following the trial I considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties and prepared, in draft, my reasons for judgment.
If the proceedings had not been discontinued, I would have made orders that Bowesco be wound up.
I have annexed to these reasons my amended draft reasons for so concluding, which I have edited to some extent from the draft reasons, which I had already prepared.
These draft reasons necessarily reflect the position as it was before the Richstar Deed of Release was executed.
This is not a case where proceedings have been discontinued before trial.
In such cases it is relevant to consider and determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them: South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission (unreported Federal Court 10 February 1989, Pincus J); Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd [1993] FCA 585 ; (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201.
Both parties have filed written submissions going to the question whether their own and the other's conduct was reasonable.
It is not necessary to consider these submissions in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case.
Where leave to discontinue is required, as in this case, O 22 r 2(3) of the Federal Court Rules 1976 (Cth) does not provide expressly for the incidence of costs.
Accordingly, I approached the matter having regard to the general discretion under O 62 r 3(1) underpinned by s 43(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1180 ; (2000) 101 FCR 160 at [12] .
In this case, given the conclusion I had already reached, costs would have been ordered in favour of ASIC.
There is no reason to depart from that usual result now.
ORDERS 
 Having regard to the conclusion I reached in the substantive proceeding albeit that it was discontinued prior to judgment, there should be an order that Bowesco pay the applicant's costs in the proceeding including any costs ordered to be in the cause as well as any reserved costs.
I certify that the preceding eleven (11) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.

 DRAFT REASONS FOR PROPOSED JUDGMENT ON MERITS 
 The Westpoint Group of companies raised finance and undertook significant building construction projects.
Lanepoint Enterprises Pty Ltd ("Lanepoint") is a direct subsidiary of Bowesco Pty Ltd ("Bowesco") and both are related or associated companies within the wider Westpoint Group of companies.
Bowesco became subject to a presumption of insolvency when receivers were appointed to it pursuant to floating charges.
ASIC has applied to wind up Bowesco on the basis of this presumption: ASIC v Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1710 at [53] and ASIC v Eastland Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1702 at [64] .
The jurisdiction of this Court to wind up companies is conferred by the Corporations Act s 459A and s 459B.
ASIC has standing to make the applications under the Act s 459P and s 464.
The presumption that Bowesco is insolvent arises pursuant to s 459C(2) of the Act is sufficient to discharge ASIC's obligation to demonstrate a prima facie case that those companies are insolvent.
Bowesco opposes the application on the ground that it is solvent.
By reason of the presumption, Bowesco bears the onus of establishing its own solvency.
Pursuant to s 459C(3) of the Act the presumption of insolvency " operates except so far as the contrary is proved for the purposes of the application ".
Applicable legal principles
 Weinberg J in Ace Contractors  Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth Development Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 728 at [44] summarised the authorities governing the operation of s 459C of the Act.
