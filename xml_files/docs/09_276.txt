 A.
INTRODUCTION 
 These proceedings concern BHPB and three of its subsidiaries --- Finance, BHPDRI and BHPTM.
Finance, the internal financier to the BHPB Group, financed projects approved by the board of directors of BHPB both initially and on an on-going basis, including projects constructed and operated by BHPDRI and BHPTM.
In the 2000 year, two projects partly financed by Finance --- the HBI plant for which BHPDRI was responsible and the Beenup Project for which BHPTM was responsible --- had not been successful.
Finance wrote off as bad part of the debt owed by BHPDRI and part of the debt owed by BHPTM.
The amounts written off by Finance in the 2000 year were: $1,845,833,281.34, of a total debt of $2,191,833,281, due to it by BHPDRI.
(There is a discrepancy of $0.34 which may be put to one side); and $310,881,702.40, of a total debt of $339,216,146.22, due to it by BHPTM.
It is the writing off by Finance of these parts of the two debts (the BHPDRI loan and the BHPTM loan) in the 2000 year which is in issue in these proceedings.
Two consequential steps for tax purposes were taken.
First, Finance claimed as a deduction the amount written off pursuant to s 25-35 of the 1997 Act.
Secondly, BHPB applied the debt forgiveness provisions to those write offs (Div 245 in Schedule 2C of the 1936 Act) but not the provisions concerning limited recourse debt in Div 243 of the 1997 Act.
B.
ISSUES AND SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS 
 The writing off of part of each debt raises five issues: whether Finance was entitled to an allowable deduction in respect of each amount written off as bad pursuant to s 25-35(1)(b) of the 1997 Act.
The central question is whether Finance was in the business of lending money and, if so, whether each loan was made by Finance in the course of that business.
In relation to the BHPTM loan, there is a further issue about whether the loan was bad; alternatively to (1), whether Finance was entitled: 
(a) pursuant to s 8-1 of the 1997 Act, to an allowable deduction in respect of each amount written off as bad;
 
(b) pursuant to s 25-35(1)(a) of the 1997 Act, to an allowable deduction of $424,204,013 in respect of the BHPDRI loan and $95,892,428 in respect of the BHPTM loan.
These amounts related to interest which accrued under the loans and which had previously been included in Finance's assessable income;
 if yes to (1) or (2) in relation to that part of the BHPTM loan written off as bad, whether the Commissioner made a valid determination pursuant to Pt IVA of the 1936 Act to cancel that bad debt deduction claimed by Finance; in the BHPB Proceedings, whether Div 243 and Pt 3-90 of the 1997 Act apply to disallow capital allowance deductions claimed by BHPB as head entity of a tax consolidated group in respect of assets of BHPDRI.
The central question is whether the BHPDRI loan was limited recourse debt for the purposes of Div 243; finally, if BHPB and Finance were unsuccessful in whole or in part in these proceedings, the question of the additional tax imposed by the Commissioner.
For the detailed reasons that follow, I consider that: Finance was entitled to an allowable deduction in respect of each part of the debt written off as bad pursuant to s 25-35(1)(b) in the 2000 year.
Finance was in the business of lending money and each loan was made by Finance in the course of that business.
Moreover, contrary to the Commissioner's submissions, the amount of the BHPTM loan written off was bad; although these questions do not arise for consideration, nevertheless: 
(a) pursuant to s 8-1 of the 1997 Act, Finance would have been entitled to an allowable deduction in respect of each amount written off as bad;
 
(b) s 25-35(1)(a) of the 1997 Act was not engaged.
There was no interest written off as bad;
 in relation to the BHPTM loan written off as bad, the Commissioner was entitled to rely upon s 169A(3) of the 1936 Act in making his s 177F(1)(b) determination.
However, Pt IVA did not apply to otherwise disallow the allowable deduction in respect of the amount of the BHPTM loan written off as bad pursuant to s 25-35(1)(b); in the BHPB Proceedings, Div 243 and Pt 3-90 of the 1997 Act did not apply to disallow capital allowance deductions claimed by BHPB as head entity of a tax consolidated group in respect of assets of BHPDRI.
The BHPDRI loan was not limited recourse debt for the purposes of Div 243; in light of my earlier findings, the question of additional tax does not arise.
However, if I am wrong in any of the conclusions I have reached, I would have remitted a substantial part of the additional tax imposed by the Commissioner.
The position adopted by BHPB and Finance was reasonably arguable.
C. FACTS 
 The facts relevant to the BHPB Group and the manner in which the group was managed are primarily sourced from the affidavits sworn by Mr Graeme McGregor, a former director of both BHPB and Finance and Mr Basil Ahyick, who was appointed in August 1994 as Finance's "Supervisor Accounting", appointed in January 1996 as "Financial Accountant [BHPB] Finance and Investments" and then appointed in January 1998 as "Team Leader SAP R/3 Project, [BHPB] Budgets and Accounting".
Their evidence in relation to these matters was not the subject of challenge.
(a) The BHPB Group
 BHPB was incorporated in 1885 and is the ultimate parent company of a diversified group of multinational natural resource companies.
In the 1990's, the period with which these proceedings are primarily concerned, the BHPB Group's principal areas of business were: the minerals group which undertook minerals exploration, production and processing principally of coal, copper, iron ore and manganese ore; the petroleum group which undertook hydrocarbon exploration, production and refining; and the steel group which undertook steel production and group corporate services.
The BHPB Group's corporate services group provided transactional services to other members of the BHPB Group including in the areas of finance, treasury and accounting, human resources and supply and procurement.
Finance, the applicant in VID 788 of 2006, formed part of the treasury section of the corporate services group.
(b) Finance
 Finance was incorporated on 29 August 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of BHPB "for the purpose of borrowing funds to re-lend to Group companies".
Its Memorandum of Association records one of its objects is "to carry on the business of financier in all its branches both within and outside Australia".
From September 1985, Finance was registered as a financial institution and a short term money market dealer / operator for the purposes of the Financial Institutions Duty Act 1982 (Vic) and s 98I of the Stamp Duties Act 1920 (NSW) [repealed by the State Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2008 (NSW)].
By the early 1980's, Finance had commenced raising finance from external lenders.
From the early 1990's, virtually all external borrowings of the BHPB Group to fund activities and projects of the BHPB Group were undertaken by Finance.
Centralisation of the financing activities of the BHPB Group within Finance provided, what were described as, numerous "administrative and corporate efficiencies" including ensuring that lenders and financiers dealt with one entity whose business could be readily understood by the finance community, centralisation of the foreign exchange operations of the BHPB Group for better monitoring and control of the group's total foreign exchange exposure and hedging activities (with foreign exchange gains and losses being treated on revenue account) and enhanced transparency of the BHPB Group's financial results by separating financing activities from operations.
As the principal financier, Finance raised money from financial institutions outside the BHPB Group by way of loan facilities, the issue of commercial paper and medium term notes.
Each year, the BHPB board set the borrowing limits and the borrowing program to be carried out by Finance for the next 12 months.
That program stipulated the proportions of short and long term debt, the mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt and the mix of currencies in which funds were to be borrowed.
For example, for the financial year ended 31 May 1996, the BHPB board granted approval for loan and other financing facilities in the name of Finance (or any other wholly owned subsidiary) for an amount not exceeding $2,275 million.
A committee of the board, consisting of two or more of the Managing Director, the Executive General Manager Finance and the Corporate Treasurer was appointed for the purposes of, inter alia, "[a]pproving, executing, delivering and performing all terms and conditions and documentation of loan and other financing facilities to be arranged by [Finance] or any other wholly owned subsidiary up to a total of $2,275 million and all terms and conditions and documentation of guarantees to be issued by [BHPB] in respect of these facilities".
Consistent with the annual resolutions of the board of BHPB, over the relevant period Finance raised large sums of money from a variety of sources: From banks and financiers outside of the BHPB Group by way of medium to long term facilities and by way of short to medium term facilities.
In the period from 17 December 1986 to 8 May 1996, Finance was the borrower under medium to long term facilities totalling billions of dollars in various currencies from numerous international financial institutions including:

 In addition, Finance entered into interest rate and currency exchange swaps with third party financial institutions to limit exposure to risks of fluctuations over the short and long term.
Samples of some of the agreements entered into by, and information memoranda issued by, Finance were tendered in evidence.
In respect of each loan agreement in evidence, Finance was the borrower with its obligations guaranteed by BHPB.
It was also the issuer of the information memoranda (guaranteed by BHPB) and it was the contracting party to the Master Swap agreements (with the obligations guaranteed by BHPB).
During the 1990's, Finance's board comprised senior executives from the BHPB Group.
By way of example, from 1996 to 1999, Mr GW McGregor, the Executive General Manager Finance for the BHPB Group, was also a director of both BHPB and Finance.
Finance did not have its own staff.
It utilised the services of BHPB for which it paid management fees.
The fees reflected the proportion of time BHPB personnel spent in providing services to Finance.
In the case of Finance, most of the services provided by BHPB were accounting and treasury personnel.
The BHPB treasury personnel had responsibility for determining the cash flow requirements of the BHPB Group using data provided by the operating divisions and relevant corporate staff, arranging the funding of those requirements and determining the form in which the funds would be raised.
Performance of those tasks was subject to "Treasury Guidelines" prepared annually by the Treasurer  Vice President Corporate Finance which were then reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer and ultimately approved by the BHPB board.
The guidelines provided a series of rules and protocols for a wide range of matters including credit limits (the total amount that could be borrowed from third parties), foreign exchange risk management, guarantees, interest rate and currency swaps, loan facilities and money market activities.
The cash flow requirements of the BHPB Group were assessed on an annual basis through the preparation of annual rolling budgets.
Each business unit prepared a budget.
Those budgets were then aggregated to form the BHPB Group budget which was ultimately approved by the BHPB board.
Preparation of the BHPB Group budget commenced in the March preceding the commencement of the next financial year.
The budget forecasts (cash inflows and cash outflows) were prepared for five years on a rolling basis.
The forecasts took into account "operating revenues, new (and yet to be approved) capital investments, capital expenditure sustaining existing projects, exploration expenditure and operating costs".
Once the budget was approved by the BHPB board, the budget necessarily identified the cash flow shortfall.
The manner in which the shortfall was funded was determined by the Corporate General Manager Taxation, the Corporate Treasurer and, ultimately, the Corporate General Manager Accounting.
During the relevant period, the policy was recorded in Section 21.19 of the BHPB Accounting Policy Manual as at May 1996 entitled "Funding of Group Companies" in the following terms: 
Details of proposed equity and / or debt funding of new group companies, or of revised funding structures for existing group companies, should initially be provided to the Corporate General Manager Accounting.
Proposals will be passed on to the Corporate General Manager Taxation and to the Corporate Treasurer for review.
The Corporate General Manager Accounting will provide Business Groups with a written "sign off" once the Corporate General Manager Taxation and the Corporate Treasurer have indicated that the proposed funding structure is acceptable.
The proposed funding structure should only be put in place upon receipt of this "sign off".
Continuous Review 
 
 
Capital funding structures of controlled entities should be reviewed regularly to ensure that the structure remains appropriate to the entities' operational and financial standing.
For example, the 100% debt funding of an existing company's activities, other than on a temporary basis, is generally considered to be inappropriate.
Similarly a company with high debt and little equity may need to have its structure reviewed if the consequential interest burden is leading the company into negative shareholder funds.
Reviews of company funding structures must be done in collaboration with the responsible taxation officer.
Before turning to consider the projects the subject of dispute in these proceedings, other aspects of the funding of group companies should be noted.
First, most BHPB Group companies with bank accounts in Australian currency were part of an ANZ (AFT) sweep facility arranged through Finance.
At the end of each day, each account balance was automatically transferred to a single bank account held by Finance.
A similar arrangement was set up between Finance and Chase Manhattan Bank for BHPB Group companies with bank accounts maintained in US dollars.
A positive bank account of a BHPB Group subsidiary swept to Finance resulted in a credit to the subsidiary's loan account with Finance and each negative balance swept to Finance resulted in a debit to the subsidiary's deposit account with Finance.
Any surplus cash would then be placed by Finance on the overnight money market with third party financial institutions.
Secondly, as a result of the process of capital expenditure approval, selection of appropriate funding structures and the banking arrangements referred to in these reasons for decision, the value of loans made by Finance to BHPB Group companies totalled billions of dollars.
For example, in the 1995 and 1996 years of income, Finance made loans to the entities listed in Schedule A totalling in excess of $17 billion.
Finance had standard lending terms for the inter-company loans which, for the relevant period, were adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994.
Those terms provided: 
... intercompany loans granted by [Finance] to [BHPB] or its subsidiaries (together the "[BHPB] Group") from 1 December 1994 will, unless special terms are negotiated for a particular loan, be subject to the following conditions:
 
 The interest rate will be 10.45% per annum or such other rate as may be nominated in advance from time to time by [Finance] as the relevant [BHPB] Group intercompany loan rate.
Such interest shall be due and payable within 21 (twenty-one) days of the day on which the relevant outstanding loan is repaid.
Loans are to be made up of such amounts and are to be advanced on such dates as are agreed orally from time to time by the borrower and [Finance].
Each initial loan and each additional loan is to be for a period not exceeding five months at which time all loans shall become immediately repayable.
The currency of each loan will be Australian Dollars.
The application of the loan funds will be to fund normal operating activities including research and development where applicable, of the borrower.

e) Commitment fees will not apply.
Unless otherwise designated, any repayments shall be applied to reduce the earliest outstanding advance and then be applied first against individual loans in excess of $50,000.
For administrative convenience, each loan made by [Finance] under this arrangement will be entered into the one loan account.
However it is acknowledged that each amount advanced is a separate loan.
[Finance] will consider renewing loans at the close of each five month period should the borrower advise (orally) that it wishes to do so.
One relevant change to these terms and conditions was an adjustment to the inter-company interest rate on 3 March 1995 as a result of a review undertaken by officers from the departments of Corporate General Manager Taxation and Manager Corporate Accounting.
After that review, the Corporate Treasurer recommended the following rates apply: 
 Australian Dollars 
 
 
11.40% on funds advanced by [Finance]
 
7.40% on funds borrowed by [Finance]
 
 
Where interest payments/receipts are made/received sixty (60) days in advance, the following rates apply:
 
 
11.20% on funds advanced by [Finance]
 
7.20% on funds borrowed by [Finance]
 
 
...
 
 
Would you please ensure that all subsidiaries are advised of these rates.
As a result of the standard loan terms and in particular cll (b) and (h) of those loan terms (see [21] above), each loan from Finance to a BHPB Group member (including BHPDRI and BHPTM the subject of dispute in these proceedings) was for a five (5) month term.
It is not in dispute that the interest rate charged on loans from Finance to BHPB Group companies was higher than the interest rate at which it borrowed those funds from external third parties and from other members of the BHPB Group.
Interest derived by Finance on the loans made to BHPB Group members accrued on a daily basis and was returned as assessable income on an accruals basis in Finance's income tax returns.
As a result of the activities of Finance, it earned substantial interest income generating substantial accounting profits after tax and taxable income.
The gross interest income, the accounting profits (after tax) and the taxable income of Finance from 1986 to 2002 (before rebates and deductions for tax losses carried forward by or transferred to Finance) was as follows: Year Interest Income

 It is necessary to consider separately the projects constructed and operated by BHPDRI and BHPTM, the subject of dispute in these proceedings.
(c) BHPDRI
 This project involved the construction of a HBI plant at Port Hedland in Western Australia to produce briquettes from iron ore fines which, in 1995, were not only considered to have little if any economic value but were an impediment to the extraction and sale of ore because of the area required to store the fines.
The intention was that "the production and sale of HBI would convert fines with little value to a valuable product and would provide further economic value for the BHPB group" by: (1) enabling more lump ore to be extracted and sold; and (2) satisfying obligations imposed upon BHPM by the Western Australian Government to undertake secondary processing of iron ore in that State.
Advice and assistance was sought by BHPIO (TB Janes) about the capital structure of BHPDRI in June 1995.
At that time, BHPDRI had paid up capital of $20 million and a submission to the BHPB board seeking approval for expenditure to build a HBI plant near BHPB's Port Hedland operations had not yet been considered by the BHPB board.
If the total expenditure for the project was ultimately approved, $300 million was forecast to be spent in the 1996 year.
On the assumption that approval from the BHPB board was obtained, on 15 June 1995 BHPIO requested advice and assistance on the preferred capital structure and debt/equity mix and to put the necessary arrangements in place for the issue of additional equity, the establishment of an appropriate inter-company loan and to ensure that the internal funding procedures were correct.
On 16 June 1995, the Chief Executive Officer of BHPM (Mr JK Ellis) sought approval from the BHPB board for the expenditure of A$1,550 million to build the HBI plant near BHPIO's Port Hedland operation.
The HBI capital expenditure submission recorded that based on 100% BHPB ownership of the project's assets (other than the tunnel), inter alia: the nominal IRR of the proposal was 22.1% (17.7% real) with a payback period of 5 years from project completion in June 1998; the incremental NPV was: 
 A$M 
 
at 15% discount rate on real cashflows 160
 
at 12.5% discount rate on nominal cashflows 870
 
at 8.25% discount rate on real cashflows 940
 
 the forecasted results reflected the strategic and incremental benefits to the BHPB Group as a whole and, in particular, BHPB's iron ore business, from the construction of the proposed HBI plant.
The BHPM Capital Procedures Manual in place in June 1995 dictated the structure and content of capital expenditure submissions including the HBI capital expenditure submission.
For example, it was the Manual which required, inter alia , that: submissions were authorised by the BHPB board on the basis of their BHPB Group impact and therefore had to be presented from that perspective.
All inter-business group and inter-divisional group implications had to be considered including the strategic importance to BHPM, the relationship or impacts on the performance of other parts of BHPB and the rationale supporting the expenditure: Sections 2.2, 3.2, Appendix 1 --- Submission Checklist.
all projects had to be in the first instance evaluated on an ungeared or unleveraged basis to highlight the basic return on total assets employed by the project: Appendix 4 --- Common Pitfalls of Investment Analysis.
The board submission (see [28] above) was supported by a two volume feasibility report comprising (1) a detailed HBI Facility Financial Model and (2) BHPIO Consolidated and Entity Financial Summaries which had been prepared on two distinct bases.
Summaries for ten entities were included, one of which was BHPDRI.
Each entity summary considered the project on a stand alone basis for that respective entity on stated assumptions.
For BHPDRI, on the assumptions stated, the summary assessed the HBI plant as having a nominal DCF rate of return of 3.5% over 20 years or with an NPV at 10% of negative $606 million.
On 20 June 1995, consistent with Section 21.19 of the BHPB Accounting Policy Manual as at May 1996 entitled "Funding of Group Companies" (see [19] above), the Corporate Treasurer reviewed the HBI capital expenditure submission and expressed a number of concerns about the proposal to the Executive General Manager Finance.
On 28 June 1995, BHPM (Taxation) provided the advice sought by BHPIO in its memorandum of 15 June 1995 (see [27] above).
The advice was in the following terms: 
In response to your note of 15 June 1995, I feel it will be appropriate for BHPDRI to continue as the project entity.
Consideration should be given to funding with debt up to a level which is consistent with commercial debt funding levels for major industrial undertakings.
You will recall that in the case of the Pilbara Energy project, a debt:equity ratio of approximately 3:1 was arrived at.
I envisage that [Finance] would lend to BHPDRI at the inter-company rate of interest.
...
There would be a very substantial pool of tax losses generated in this entity in initial years of development and operation from interest, RD and capital depreciation.
This will provide [BHPB] the desirable flexibility to utilise such tax losses under group tax relief arrangements to offset income and tax payments in other parts of the [BHPB] group.
If [BHPB] invites future external participation in the project, arrangements should be structured to allow BHPDRI to remain a 100% [BHPB] entity so that project tax losses could continue to be transferred for the benefit of the Group.
...
 
 The next day, 29 June 1995, the board of BHPB approved capital expenditure of A$1,550m on the HBI project.
The presentation to the BHPB board was made by the Chief Executive Officer of BHPM, Mr JK Ellis.
Subsequent to the presentation and in response to questions raised during the presentation, on 5 July 1995 further details were provided by Mr Ellis to the Managing Director of BHPB about the profit impact of additional ore sales and the composition of the consequential capital of $1,200m included in the HBI cash flow analysis.
What then occurred was not explained other than in the most general terms.
However, the loan facility for BHPDRI was established with Finance.
It was not in dispute that the terms of that loan were in accordance with Finance's standard lending terms for inter-company loans which were adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994 set out at [21] above.
As a result of the standard loan terms and in particular cll (b) and (h) of those terms (see [21] - [23] above), each loan was for a five (5) month term.
To accommodate the fact that at the end of each five month period a fresh advance was made, there were two loan accounts for the loan to BHPDRI from Finance --- account numbers 325320 and 326320 --- which were used for alternate 5 month periods.
Initially loan account 326320 was used.
The opening entry in that account on 31 July 1995 was a debit entry of $8,200,137.58 with the notation "I/CO TRANSFER REF G KERNI".
On 1 October 1995, that loan account with a debit balance of $20,422,717.50 was closed and a new advance in the sum of $20,422,717.50 was made by Finance to BHPDRI in account number 325320.
In October 1995 and May 1996, the directors of BHPDRI resolved to allot 35 million and then, subsequently, 75 million $1.00 shares to BHPM Holdings.
During September and October 1996, an exhaustive review of the HBI project was undertaken.
As a result of that review, two events occurred in November 1996.
First, on 12 November 1996, BHPIO (T Janes) revisited the question of the capital structure of BHPDRI which had been adopted in June 1995 (see [31] above) and secondly, BHPM sought approval from BHPB for additional capital expenditure of A$140 million over and above that approved in June 1995.
That capital expenditure submission was prepared in accordance with the Applicable Capital Procedures Manual then in place dated October 1996.
Prior to the further capital expenditure submission being considered by the BHPB board, both the question of the appropriate debt/equity mix and funding structure for the capital expenditure, consistent with the BHPB Accounting Policy Manual (see [19] above), was considered by Corporate Taxation.
Approval was received for: an equity investment of $370m to be made by BHPM Holdings in BHPDRI after 31 December 1996; and to continue the equity funding of BHPDRI on the basis of a 50 / 50 debt to equity ratio (as had existed).
In reaching those conclusions, the required debt to equity level was considered.
The advice provided by BHPM Taxation on that issue was that: 
... it has been seen that the selection of a debt to equity ratio is a matter of choice.
The selection should therefore take into account the intended purpose of the company.
This company will primarily be involved in the export sale of beneficiated product where it maybe [sic] competing directly with local suppliers in foreign countries.
From past experience with claims that our companies are resorting to unfair competition by dumping produce on foreign markets based on the observation that the particular companies never make any profits we need to ensure that this company is not saddled with a level of debt that leads to it being branded in the same way.
For this reason we consider that the current debt to equity ratio (50%/50%) should be maintained.
On 29 November 1996, the BHPB board approved revised capital expenditure on the HBI project from A$1,550,000,000 to $1,673,600,000.
The approved increase was $123.6m.
Consistent with the advice received from Corporate Taxation, on 30 January 1997 the directors of BHPDRI resolved to allot 370 million $1 shares to BHPM Holdings.
As the general ledger for the loans from Finance to BHPDRI records, Finance advanced funds to BHPDRI which, together with the subscriptions of capital, were used progressively to pay expenses incurred by BHPDRI in the development and construction of the HBI plant.
In addition, the general ledger trial balance recording the loan from Finance to BHPDRI reflects that the loan was conducted in accordance with Finance's standard lending terms for inter-company loans adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994 (see [21] - [23] above).
In August 1997, BHPB's Managing Director (Mr Prescott) asked Mr McGregor to conduct a review of the HBI project.
At that time, one of the central issues raised by Mr Prescott was that, from the start of the project, not all of the risks associated with the project were understood.
At the time of the review, Mr McGregor was Executive General Manager Finance for the BHPB Group as well as a director of both BHPB and Finance.
The review was completed by 11 September 1997 ("the HBI Audit Report").
The HBI Audit Report attached to the memorandum from Mr McGregor is important.
That report stated, inter alia, that: the projected NOPAT [net operating profit after tax] and ROC [return on capital] from the HBI plant per se were very modest, which was recognised at the time of the initial capital submission; escalation in Capex and cash operation costs (thought to be $140 per tonne) meant that the HBI project on a stand alone basis would not generate a return in excess of 1.5% to 2.5%.
(This is to be compared with the fact that the Detailed Capital Submission Report in 1995 showed that the HBI Plant on a stand alone basis had a DCF rate of return of 3.5%); HBI was a low margin business that needed cheap gas, cheap electricity, low capital costs and low operating cost to succeed and the HBI project was challenged in relation to each of these matters.
At that time, the choice was to abandon the project altogether or persist with completion as economically and expeditiously as possible.
In the best interests of Finance and the BHPB Group, Mr McGregor concluded that "a forward view of the project reveal[ed] that there [was] no case to be made for either abandoning the project or slowing it down [and that] the only sensible course of action [was] to complete the project as expeditiously and cheaply as possible".
As a result, Mr McGregor sought approval for total capital expenditure on the HBI plant of $2,275 million plus $128 million for commissioning costs.
Consistent with the McGregor recommendation, on 18 November 1997, the Chief Executive Officer of BHP Ferrous Minerals forwarded to the Managing Director of BHPB (Mr Prescott) a memorandum entitled "[HBI] Project Supplementary Authorisation" seeking additional capital expenditure of $730 million, an increase of 44% above the existing authorisation.
Based on an incremental cost to complete the project of $550 million, the memorandum reported that (1) the incremental NPV (nominal at 12.5%) was expected to be $888 million with a nominal IRR of 32.3% and (2) if the project did not proceed, the associated NPV loss was expected to be $429 million.
The projected cash flows from the HBI project were set out in Attachment 1 to the "[HBI] Project Supplementary Authorisation" to be: Financial Summary Year 1 1998 Year 2 1999 Year 3 2000 Year 4 
 2001 Year 5 
 2002 Subsequent Years (Average) 
 Cash 
Flow 
A$M -948.8 -549.8 -91.8 360.5 244.7 557.1 
 
The uncontroverted evidence was that these projected "cash flows" were calculated prior to commissioning of the project by reference to the outgoings incurred, and then, after commissioning, were calculated by deducting expected costs and the cost of replacement of capital from projected revenues.
By year six, the projected cash flows were positive.
A payback period of six to seven years was expected.
Mr McGregor's recommendation together with the supplementary capital expenditure submission was considered and accepted by the BHPB board on 27 November 1997.
After the board meeting, the Managing Director of BHPB (Mr Prescott) forwarded a memorandum to the Chief Executive Officer BHP Ferrous Minerals, copied to the Executive Director Finance, on 1 December 1997 in the following terms: 
I confirm that the Board at its meeting on 27 November gave approval for completing and commissioning the Pilbara HBI project as recommended in your memo of 18 November 1997.
In so doing the Board gave approval for the expenditure of an additional $730 million on the project comprising $668 million in additional capital spending and $62 million in additional capitalised pre-commissioning operating expenditure.
In implementing this approval the following imperatives apply:
 
 Every effort must be made to improve the commercial outcomes of the entire project.
There is to be clear and thorough reporting of all significant developments in a timely fashion including all management action to address issues that may arise or opportunities for project outcomes to be improved.
This reporting is to be monthly through Iron Ore's Business Reports and through appropriate comments in the Managing Director's Report, also monthly through Project Management's Business Report and quarterly (or more frequently if required) in the Business Reports presented to the Board.
We are to pursue the proposal to sell down 15% of the project to our Japanese partners in our other iron ore businesses.
We are to further investigate the advantages and disadvantages of iron ore feed price alternatives to the plant.

A copy of this memorandum was sent to Mr Lance Coburn who at this time was the Group General Manager, BHPM Finance.
In his capacity as Group General Manager, BHPM Finance, Mr Coburn had responsibility for the financial aspects of BHPM, which included preparation of statutory accounts for most of the entities within BHPM, and responsibility to ensure compliance with BHPB Group policies and procedures in preparation of capital expenditure submissions and compliance with capital expenditure approvals.
On 5 December 1997, the Group General Manager BHPB Budgets and Accounting sent a note to Mr McGregor (at that time the Executive General Manager, Finance and a director of Finance) entitled "Asset Carrying Values".
The note listed those assets which did not or would not provide a return of 10% or greater by May 1998 based on current book values.
One of the assets listed was the HBI plant as a stand alone asset.
The NPV of that operation based on book value determined on a 10% DCF basis was negative $657 million.
This value did not include any benefits from the plant to be derived by the iron ore mines.
Construction of the HBI Plant continued throughout 1998.
Two critical events occurred during the course of that year.
At the end of the 1998 financial year (31 May 1998) the board of BHPB changed its accounting policy for determining the recoverable value of non-current assets from undiscounted future net cash flows to discounted cash flows using the weighted average pre-tax interest rate of the BHPB Group's long term borrowings.
This change was adopted to reconcile the accounts prepared under the Australian generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") with those applicable under United States GAAP.
As a result of this change, adjustments were made to the recoverable value of non-current assets which resulted in changes to BHPB's profit and shareholders' equity.
In the case of BHPDRI, as at 31 May 1998, the carrying value of BHPDRI's non current assets was written down by $590 million.
The financial effect of the write down was to reduce the carrying value of certain assets of BHPDRI by that amount and to reduce BHPDRI's profit by $377,600,000 (after tax).
The second event was an update on the HBI project presented to the BHPB board on 27 November 1998.
By that time, construction of the plant was "largely complete" with the first briquette expected at the end of January 1999.
However, there were still problems.
The US scrap price had plunged to new depths and the estimated sales of briquettes would not require full plant capacity once the plant was completed and commissioned.
At that time, the options were to "[c]ommission all trains on current schedule (1/99, 4/99, 5/99, 6/99) [and] Operate 1 train and others necessary to meet market" or "Defer Completion  Commissioning Module 2 [and] Commission  Operate When Market Justifies (2002?)".
On 30 November 1998, the BHPB board agreed that BHP Ferrous Minerals "should complete construction of the entire plant, commission all trains on [the] current schedule and then operate only those trains necessary to meet (RD) testing and product sales requirements".
Consistent with the recommendation and subsequent approval by the BHPB board, train 1 of the HBI Plant was commissioned in early January 1999.
However, it was shut down after 10 days because of production difficulties associated with the reduction process to produce DRI.
The production difficulties were caused by the iron ore and partly reduced material not flowing continuously through the reactor train.
There were frequent, sudden flow stoppages which upset the process and any attempt to balance the heat and mass flows in the reactor.
In addition, the stoppages greatly increased the rate of accretion growth which required the reactors to be cleaned every 25 rather than every 160 days.
At the end of the 1999 financial year, the carrying value of the HBI plant was written down by a further $531 million after tax.
On 21 July 1999, a letter was sent on BHPB letterhead from Joe Czyzewski, a director of Finance, to the directors of BHPDRI in the following terms: 
[Finance] is aware that [BHPDRI] has commenced selling product and is working towards generating a viable cash flow in order to service its loans.
In the circumstances, [Finance] confirms that it does not intend for the period of twelve month's (sic) from the date of this letter, or for such shorter period as we may specify at our election, intend to seek repayment of any loan it may have with [BHPDRI] but shall keep the company's commercial performance under ongoing review.
Prior notice shall be given to you should it become necessary for [Finance] to take action in respect of any loan.
In March 2000, a further review of the HBI project was undertaken in response to the BHPB board's concerns about current performance of the operations and the inability of the plant to meet commissioning targets.
At the BHPB board meeting on 23 March 2000, a presentation was made about the future of the HBI plant.
The board resolved: (1) that trials to assess the technical adequacy and commercial viability of the HBI facility should proceed until September 2000 when the board would again review the investment; and (2) to approve additional capital expenditure of $46 million.
At the same time, a review of the carrying value of the asset was to be completed by the end of April 2000.
The board of Finance met on 30 March 2000.
After noting the decisions of the BHPB board on 23 March 2000 and that BHPDRI was indebted to Finance in the amount of $2,113,944,530, the Finance board resolved to write to the BHPDRI directors to advise them that Finance would conduct a review of the loan by engaging Ernst  Young as independent experts to report on the valuation of the loan.
Pending receipt of the Ernst  Young report, the directors of Finance agreed that a provision be made against the loan in Finance's books by adopting the "worst case" scenario which indicated a negative carrying value of the loan.
Further consideration of the question of interest on the loan was deferred pending receipt of the Ernst  Young report.
Moreover, the directors of Finance agreed to review the provision of further loans to BHPDRI after discussions with BHPB management and to keep the BHPDRI loan under close review.
On 3 April 2000, Finance informed BHPDRI of these matters.
As a result of Finance making provision on 31 March 2000 of a $2,174 million doubtful debt for its loan to BHPDRI, Finance was left with negative net assets in excess of $940 million.
The BHBP Group Treasurer (Mr Czyzewski) was concerned that if the situation was not corrected, Finance may have been in breach of its various loan and financing arrangements.
Accordingly, on 7 April 2000, he sought immediate approval for BHPB to seek an allotment of 950 million ordinary fully paid up shares in Finance (the consideration for such an allotment was to be $950 million).
On the same day that approval was sought for BHPB to seek allotment of 950 million shares in Finance (7 April 2000), the Chief Financial Officer of BHPB wrote to BHPDRI in the following terms: 
At its meeting on 23 and 24 March 2000 the Board of [BHPB] approved additional funding of [BHPDRI] until September 2000.
[Finance] has discussed the provision of further loan funds to [BHPDRI] through the existing intercompany loan facility and advised that it is unable to fund the further approved expenditure.
The shareholder of [BHPDRI], [BHPM Holdings] has agreed to inject equity into [BHPDRI] with a total issue price of $150 million.
This equity injection will be completed immediately.
[BHPB] has agreed to subscribe for equity in [BHPM Holdings] as may be necessary to enable [BHPM Holdings] to meet the equity injection into [BHPDRI].
Approval for BHPB to seek an allotment of 950 million shares in Finance was provided and, on 11 April 2000, the directors of Finance resolved to allot 950 million ordinary fully paid $1.00 shares to BHPB.
At the same time, BHPB Accounting and Reporting made changes to the loan account between Finance and BHPDRI on 10 April in the following ways: 
The current loan account between [Finance] and [BHPDRI] (account number 23700011) will be 'frozen' at the 31 March 2000 closing balance, including capitalised interest yet to be booked to that date (Note: there have been no transactions since 1 April 2000).
To facilitate the day to day cash transactions of [BHPDRI], an intercompany loan account between [BHPB] and [BHPDRI] has been established and should be used from today.
The account number is 23700012 and is a standard [BHPB] short term, interest free loan.
Following the $150 million equity injection, this intercompany loan account must be maintained as an asset loan (debit balance) in [BHPDRI's] accounts as the funding of HBI operations is via equity not the loan facility.
A request for further equity funding will be necessary if required.
...
 
 
(emphasis in original).
After providing their preliminary views in April 2000, Ernst  Young tendered their report on the valuation of the BHPDRI loan receivable to the directors of Finance on 3 May 2000.
Ernst  Young concluded that the value of the HBI plant did not exceed $346 million and had a nil value if the plant was closed.
The report was considered by the directors of Finance at a meeting of the board held on the day the report was issued, 3 May 2000.
The directors resolved that: the Directors having made due inquiries and on the basis of the advice and conclusions given to Directors by the independent expert, have formed the view that the amount of $1,845,833,281 lent to [BHPDRI] is irrecoverable and bad and be written-off as bad;
 
2) (a) the entries be made in the accounts of [Finance] to record the write-off of the irrecoverable amount pursuant to Resolution 1 forthwith; and
 
 
 (b) the provision continue to be carried against the balance of the loan not written-off being $346,000,000.00.
subject to the above accounting entries being completed, [BHPDRI] be subsequently notified that due to the poor financial condition of [BHPDRI] it would not be economically prudent to expend additional monies in taking proceedings to recover any or all of the said monies once they have been written off ...
 
The Directors went on to note that interest on the loan would continue to be capitalised on the balance not written off and provided as doubtful.
On 10 May 2000, Finance wrote to both the directors of BHPDRI and to BHPDRI advising of the loan write off of $1,845,833,281 against the outstanding principal and interest of $2,191,833,281 and that following the write off, the directors of Finance had resolved not to take any further action to recover the debt written off as it appeared practically irrecoverable but that Finance reserved the right to recover the balance.
The letter went on to state that Finance did not intend to seek repayment of the balance for the period up to 15 June 2001.
On 18 May 2000, the directors of BHPDRI resolved to allot 150 million $1 shares to BHPM Holdings.
On 31 May 2000, BHPDRI wrote off the balance of its HBI investment in the sum of $794 million after tax.
Towards the middle of 2000, things appeared to improve after significant further capital expenditure expended to alter the process conditions within the reactor essentially resolved the initial problems.
At 30 June 2000, BHPB applied Div 245 of Schedule 2C of the 1936 Act to cancel the losses and Finance claimed the bad debt deductions under s 25-35(1)(b) of the 1997 Act.
On 24 May 2001, the BHPDRI directors resolved to allot an additional 45 million $1 shares to BHPM Holdings.
Over 2003 and 2004, levels of production at the HBI plant increased.
However, the HBI plant continued to be plagued by upsets in production.
By May 2004, operations had been suspended following an accident which resulted in the death of one employee and serious injury to three others.
After a detailed review of options for the plant, BHPB announced on 24 August 2005 that it would permanently close the HBI Plant.
(d) BHPTM
 BHPTM (known as Mineral Deposits Pty Ltd until 14 July 1995) had a long history of mining titanium minerals.
It had titanium minerals mining operations and a processing plant in New South Wales.
BHPTM also held a mining lease over a large resource of titanium minerals (predominantly ilmenite) at Beenup in Western Australia.
In November 1994, the proposal was to develop ilmenite mining and processing facilities at Beenup in Western Australia and to purchase an interest in an existing ilmenite smelting facility at Tyssedal in Norway.
The proposal was to mine the ore body (containing ilmenite and other heavy minerals) at Beenup and to truck the heavy mineral products to the Port of Bunbury for export to the Tyssedal Facility and other users.
The mine and associated processing facilities were to be conducted by BHPTM.
On 15 November 1994, the Chief Executive Officer of BHPM (Mr JK Ellis) sought approval, by way of submission, from the BHPB board for the expenditure of A$222.6 million for the purpose of developing the mining and processing facilities at Beenup in Western Australia and the purchase of an interest in the existing Tinfos ilmenite smelting facility at Tyssedal in Norway.
The capital expenditure submission recorded, inter alia, the nominal IRR of the proposal was 19.1% (15.2% real) with a payback period of 6.7 years.
On 21 November 1994, the Corporate Treasurer (Mr Zimmerman) sent a memorandum to the Executive General Manager Finance analysing the BHPM capital expenditure proposal.
At that time, the "major technical risks" were that there was "no mineral sands experience of dredging to 45 metres depth and that the deposit [had] a high slimes content".
The BHPB board approved capital expenditure of $222,600,000 for the BHPTM project at Beenup on 24 November 1994.
The general ledger trial balance recording the loan from Finance to BHPTM reflects that the loan was conducted in accordance with Finance's standard lending terms for inter-company loans adopted by resolution of the board of Finance on 30 November 1994 (see [21] - [23] above).
As a result of those loan terms and in particular cll (b) and (h) of the standard loan terms, each loan was for a five (5) month term.
On 5 July 1995, a two year letter of comfort was provided by BHPB to the directors of BHPTM.
So far as is relevant, the letter stated: 
 1.
Existing Debts 
 
 
[BHPB] undertakes to your company to ensure that your company is provided with sufficient funds to pay those debts which your company has elected to incur before the date of this undertaking, if your company is called upon to pay those debts and if, but for this letter, your company would now be insolvent.
2.
Future Debts 
 
 
[BHPB] undertakes to your company to ensure that your company is provided with sufficient funds to pay debts which your company elects to incur after the date of this undertaking, if your company is called upon to pay those debts, and if, but for this letter, your company would be insolvent at the time when it incurs the debt or as a consequence of incurring the debt.
3.
Meaning of "Debts" 
 
 
Notwithstanding anything in Clause 1, 2 or 5, this letter applies only to debts which your company incurs or has incurred:
 
 
(a) in the normal course of its operations;
 
 
(b) in accordance with all relevant approved operating and capital budgets, business plans, policies and procedures of [BHPB] or otherwise with the express or implied approval of [BHPB].
4.
Discharge by Payment or Subscription 
 
 
Without limiting any other right of [BHPB], [BHPB] may completely discharge its obligations under this letter in respect of any debt by subscribing for shares issued by your company with a nominal value equal to the amount of the debt or by paying the amount of the debt to your company at any time.
5.
Termination 
 
 
5.1 Upon the earlier of:
 
 
(a) the expiry of two (2) years from the date of this letter; or
 
 
(b) your company receiving from [BHPB] a notice which states that this letter is revoked,
 
 
this letter shall forthwith cease to be of effect, except in respect of debts which exist before that time.
...
 
 
 6.
Benefit of letter: Reliance 
 
 
This letter is for your benefit of your company and its directors only, and is not to be relied upon by any other person.
The loan funds provided by Finance were used to fund the continuing development of the Beenup mine from 1995.
Production at the mine commenced on 13 January 1997.
At that time, BHPTM already had entered into a long term contract to supply ilmenite to a BHPB joint venture in Norway ("the Norwegian Contract").
On 17 July 1997, a second letter of comfort was provided by BHPB to the directors of BHPTM.
Again, so far as is relevant, the letter was largely in the same terms as the first letter of comfort (see [66] above) but for cl 5.1(a) which stated "the expiry of one year from the date of this letter".
The board minutes of BHPTM resolved that "on the basis of" the 17 July 1997 letter of comfort, there were reasonable grounds to believe that BHPTM would be able to pay its debts as and when they fell due and the board authorised the directors to sign the relevant statement to be provided under s 301 of the Corporations Law.
By late 1997, BHPTM's Beenup mine had experienced significant operational difficulties.
The material being mined at Beenup was much harder than expected.
Further complications had arisen in disposing of and storing the tailings from the mining operations.
By the end of the 1998 financial year (31 May 1998), the project was continuing to encounter serious difficulties and, as a result, was not meeting its contractual commitments to supply titanium minerals to customers.
Two steps were taken by BHPTM.
First, BHPTM declared force majeure under the terms of the Norwegian Contract and secondly, following a review of the carrying value of assets undertaken as part of the preparation of BHPTM's financial statements for the 1998 year (ending 31 May 1998), on 18 June 1998 Mr McGregor (as Executive General Manager Finance) recommended to the BHPB board that it approve writing down the carrying value of the Beenup assets by $99 million (after tax) on the assumption that an economically feasible solution would be developed to overcome the operational difficulties at the mine.
As noted earlier (see [45] above), on 31 May 1998, the BHPB Group changed its accounting policy for determining the carrying value of assets.
On 9 July 1998, a third letter of comfort was provided by BHPB to the directors of BHPTM.
But for the date, the letter was in the same terms as the second letter of comfort (see [68] above).
The board minutes of BHPTM again resolved "on the basis of" the 9 July 1998 letter of comfort that there were reasonable grounds to believe that BHPTM would be able to pay its debts as and when they fell due and the board authorised the directors to sign the relevant statement to be provided under s 301 of the Corporations Law.
Between May and November 1998, further work continued on the Beenup mine particularly in relation to the issue of disposal of the tailings.
Throughout this period, the board of BHPB continued to approve and support the operations.
In December 1998, a parallel process examining "exit possibilities" commenced.
The carrying value of the Beenup assets was again reconsidered during the preparation of the half yearly accounts for the period ended 30 November 1998.
Following consideration of a memorandum prepared by Mr Jim Hall (the Group General Manager BHPB Budgets  Accounting) to the Executive Director Finance dated 3 December 1998, the audit committee of BHPB resolved at a meeting on 17 December 1998 that the carrying value of the Beenup assets be retained at $114 million.
The memorandum recorded: at 31 May 1998, the carrying value of the Beenup assets was written down by $150 million (pre tax) to $134 million because of technical and other operational problems; between 31 May and 30 November 1998, significant progress had been made on a tailings disposal solution but the work was approximately 4 months behind plan; the carrying value for the half year November 1998 was fundamentally unchanged from May 1998 and again assumed an economically feasible technical solution to the technical and other operational problem s; at the BHPB board meeting on 27 November 1998, a quarterly review of the Beenup project was presented to the board at which time the board agreed to continue with operations and in parallel to examine exit options, including by sale, merger or closure; the exit options and valuations were to be formalised by 31 May 1999 and if the closure option was adopted, then in addition to considering the carrying value, the BHPB accounts would need to include allowance for rehabilitation and site closure costs, breach of contract claims from customers and other costs.
Technical difficulties, however, continued to affect the mine and, in February 1999, a decision was made to close the plant and write off the balance of the carrying value of the investment.
On 26 February 1999, BHPB issued a press release announcing the closure of the mine in the following terms: 
The decision follows an extensive study into technical problems caused by the high clay content of the Beenup orebody which had impacted on the management of tailings and the mine's ability to reach satisfactory levels of production.
President [BHPTM], Mr CE (Colin) Smith said the Company had directed considerable engineering and technical resources at resolving the problems at Beenup over a 12 month period.
"After significant effort, it just wasn't possible to find a feasible solution that would allow the operations to continue.
... there comes a time when a company has to made hard decisions on a project such as this.
That time has come.
We have taken the engineering and technical research as far as we can.
Mr Smith said [BHPB] had looked for a buyer with access to different technology and alternative business objectives for Beenup, but it had become apparent in recent days that this would not be possible.
The search included major titanium mineral producers and processors around the world.

 
 
[BHPB] is committed to continuing to manage and effectively address all environmental issues at the site.
A detailed decommissioning and minesite rehabilitation plan is being prepared ...
 
 
Costs of the write-off of the current book value of the Beenup assets, site rehabilitation and mine closure are expected to be approximately $150 million after tax.
(emphasis added)
 Operations at the plant ceased on 16 April 1999.
After the mine closed, the directors of BHPTM conducted a review of options available to the company and considered the means by which BHPTM might have been able to service its loan with Finance.
That review continued at least from May until August 1999.
On 31 May 1999, Finance provided approximately $62 million to BHPTM to enable it to repay an overdraft it had with the ANZ bank.
On 8 July 1999, a fourth letter of comfort was provided by BHPB to the directors of BHPTM.
Again, so far as is relevant, the letter was largely in the same terms as the second letter of comfort (see [68] above) but for the addition of the words "[i]t does not and is not intended to impose any contractual or legal obligations on [BHPB] in respect of any other person nor bind it to any particular requirement or course of action" to the end of the letter.
Before that letter of comfort was considered by the directors of BHPTM, the Group Treasurer (Mr J Czyzewski) informed the directors of BHPTM by letter dated 9 July 1999 that: 
I note that the Directors are expecting to have the benefit of a Letter of Comfort from its parent, [BHPB], in the same form as the attached draft.
[Finance] confirms that it will not demand payment of its loan to the company pending a complete review of the company's future operations, including current proposals to transfer a commercial Group operation into the company.
[Finance] shall review its position in six months time or earlier as warranted in the circumstances.
[Finance] shall advise the directors prior to taking any action in respect of its loan following the review.
At a meeting held on 19 July 1999, the directors of BHPTM tabled the annual accounts for the 1999 year and after referring to the 8 July 1999 letter of comfort undertaking "(on a conditional basis) to provide sufficient funds to the Company to enable it to pay debts which the Company elects to incur", the board was of the opinion "there were reasonable grounds to believe that [BHPTM] would be able to pay its debts as and when they fell due" and authorised the directors to sign the relevant statements to be provided under the Corporations Law .
BHPTM completed its review of options by early August 1999.
At a meeting of directors of BHPTM on 18 August 1999 (chaired by Mr Coburn) the directors considered the options for meeting the existing and ongoing obligations of BHPTM.
The minutes record what transpired at that meeting in the following terms: 
The outcome of recent discussions with the owners of certain profitable mining operations regarding proposals for the transfer of assets into [BHPTM] to strengthen its balance sheet, and as a result, to assist with the servicing of the [Finance] debt, was discussed.
It was noted that the discussions under consideration had produced no agreement and will not be pursued.
It was agreed that no other options for improving the liquidity of [BHPTM] were apparent and it was therefore necessary to consider the means of meeting the company's existing and future obligations, in particular, the loan payable to [Finance].
[Finance] had provided an undertaking not to call its loan until a review of the reorganisation opportunities had occurred.
[Finance] has now requested the company to provide details of this review on Friday 20 August 1999.
It was agreed that Mr Coburn make the presentation to the board of [Finance].
Finally, the directors examined the balance sheet of the company to ascertain the likely shortfall on realisation of the company's assets to meet existing obligations in the event that a demand for payment may issue from [Finance].
The directors are currently relying upon the terms of the comfort letter that was provided by the parent, [BHPB], on 8 July 1999.
...
 
 On 20 August 1999, two events occurred.
First, BHPTM (Mr Coburn) sent a letter to Finance concerning the future operations of BHPTM.
The letter stated: 
BHPTM has been closely reviewing certain options for the transfer of a profitable mining operation into the company to bolster its balance sheet, and as a corollary, to introduce some means of servicing its loan from [Finance] over an extended period, thus avoiding an event of default.
The discussions with other Group entities concerning these proposals have ended without agreement as the options under consideration were not feasible.
In view of this, the prospects of expanding the company's activities to assist with the servicing and repayment of its debt to [Finance] are now, in all likelihood, non-existent.
The directors are presently reviewing the company's balance sheet to assess its ability to meet existing and ongoing obligations.
Should [Finance] call [on] its loan in the immediate future, the directors believe that [Finance] would realise little more than the amount of $11.5 million that BHPTM currently has on deposit with [Finance].
That letter, together with a presentation on the financial position of BHPTM from Mr Coburn, was considered at a meeting of directors of Finance held on 20 August 1999.
By that date, Mr McGregor had taken leave of absence pending his imminent retirement and the directors attending the meeting were Mr Czyzewski (the Corporate Treasurer) and Messrs HE Rose and BJ Skahill.
BHPTM's financial position was summarised as follows: YEM '99 financials poor
 Nopat [Net Operating Profit After Tax] Loss $13 million [before abnormals] Ebit [Earnings Before Interest and Tax] Loss $25 million [before abnormals]
 Beenup operations closed in February 1999
 Write-offs [after tax] as follows:
 YEM '98 $99 million YEM '99 $154 million
 Review undertaken --- As per letter from [BHPB] dated 9 th July'99.
Transfer to another mining operations not feasible.
Claim against company for non-performance of supply contract --- Approx $49m.
With the exception of some land which may realise a $2-$3 million above book value, all assets in the attached balance sheet are believed to be at realisable value.
Any future proceeds will be used to satisfy priority claims.
The prospects of servicing or repaying the loan from [Finance] are non-existent.
That same day, 20 August 1999, the Vice President Group Accounting  Reporting, Mr J Hall, forwarded a memorandum to Mr Chip Goodyear concerning the loan from Finance to BHPTM.
A copy of the memorandum was provided to Mr Czyzewski, the Corporate Treasurer and a director of Finance.
After setting out the problems faced by BHPTM and the fact that the directors of BHPTM had advised Finance of the outcome of the recent review, the memorandum continued: 
Therefore, the Directors of [Finance] are proposing to write-down the majority of the loan to [BHPTM] of $336 million to its realisable value, having regard to the borrowing company's financial position and outlook.
It is likely the Company will eventually be liquidated following satisfaction of its commercial obligations.
The write-down will be disclosed in the accounts of [Finance] as a bad debt.
In order to reflect this in the accounts of the affected companies, a number of actions are recommended.
[BHPB] will revoke the Letter of Comfort provided to [BHPTM] on 8 July 1999 and to create a new, but limited, Deed of Support to the extent of future external debts only including any obligations pertaining to the Beenup Project imposed on the Company under the Mining Agreement with the State Government of Western Australia.
The new Deed of Support should provide the Directors of [BHPTM] with greater security, as it will be legally enforceable.
Notwithstanding this, the deed will permit the undertaking to be revoked at the discretion of [BHPB], but without limiting the comfort for any trading obligation incurred up to the date of the termination.
[BHPB] does not propose, however, to support internal funding obligations under these revised arrangements.
...
It is confirmed that as the Deed of Support does not extend [BHPB's] existing exposure to the Beenup Project, or other activities of [BHPTM], no approval is required from the Board or the Managing Director.
Furthermore, the proposed level of support, up to US$100 million is within your existing authority.
In order to commence these formal arrangements it is necessary to revoke the Letter of Comfort and enter into the Deed of Support.
Your approval is sought for the following:
 
 [BHPB] to advise [BHPTM] that the Letter of Comfort dated 8 July 1999 is to be revoked forthwith; A new limited undertaking will be provided by means of a binding Deed of Support with the Directors of [BHPTM] and [BHPTM].
In this regard refer to the memorandum to you from Legal Counsel (Peter Ablett).
If acceptable, please sign the Deed on page 4 and have your signature witnessed.
Letter dated 23 August 1999 to the Directors of [BHPTM] stating that the Letter of Comfort is to be revoked with effect from Monday, 23 August 1999 and a proposal to enter into a Deed of Support.
This letter can be signed on behalf of [BHPB] by the Group Treasurer.
During the morning of 23 August 1999, BHPB informed the Directors of BHPTM in writing that it intended to revoke the letter of comfort of 8 July 1999 and that it proposed a new arrangement by way of a Deed of Support be entered into by the two companies which would be legally enforceable and provide the Directors of BHPTM with greater security.
A draft of the Deed was attached.
The letter went on to state that revocation of the letter of comfort would take effect upon execution of the Deed of Support.
At 11.15 am on 23 August 1999, the Directors of BHPTM (Messrs Coburn, March, CE Smith and WB Smith) met.
The meeting lasted half an hour.
The minutes of the meeting record that after Mr Coburn explained the outcome of his presentation to the board of Finance, Mr Coburn: tabled the letter from BHPB of 23 August 1999 notifying of its intention to revoke the letter of comfort of 8 July 1999 and that, in substitution, BHPB proposed to enter into a new "comfort undertaking" with BHPTM in the form of a Deed of Support which subsumed the letter of comfort; explained that there existed some doubt as to the enforceability of the undertaking provided in the letter of comfort of 8 July 1999 whereas the Deed offered greater security as it would be legally enforceable; and recommended that the offer from BHPB be accepted.
The minutes record that the legal ramifications of entering into the Deed and the impact on directors' responsibilities were then discussed.
After agreeing to review the trading position of BHPTM later in that day, the directors resolved that each of them would sign the Deed of Support and affix the company seal to the Deed.
The Deed of Support was executed and bears the date "23 August 1999".
That was not all that happened on 23 August.
At 12 noon, 15 minutes after the meeting of directors of BHPTM concluded, and one assumes after the Deed of Support had been executed, the directors of Finance met and resolved to call for payment of the BHPTM loan of $339,216,146.22 set off against the deposit of $11,593,237.88 and in the event that there was a failure to repay the balance, to write off the balance outstanding of $310,881,702.40.
Consistent with that resolution, a letter was sent by Mr Czyzewski for and on behalf of Finance to Mr Coburn as a director of BHPTM in the following terms: 
We refer to our letter of 9 July 1999 wherein [Finance] gave an undertaking that it would not call its loan whilst the company reviewed its future options which included the proposed transfer of a profitable mining operation into the company to bolster its balance sheet and to introduce a source of ongoing funds which would assist with the servicing of the loan.
You advised [Finance] at a meeting on 20 August 1999 that the review has now been completed and that it was decided that it was not appropriate to pursue the options under consideration.
We have also been advised that the letter of comfort dated 8 July 1999 provided by [BHPB] to BHPTM has now been cancelled.
This in combination with the results of our assessment of the financial position of BHPTM indicates to us that a material adverse change has occurred in the general financial condition of BHPTM which could materially effect (sic) its ability to perform its loan obligations.
We advise that the loan facility is hereby cancelled and we now declare the loan and all interest accrued thereon amounting to $339,216,416.22 forthwith due and payable.
Please remit these funds immediately.
Of course, repayment of the whole of the outstanding balance of the loan was not going to occur.
But for the amount on deposit, there were no funds to remit.
Later that same day, BHPTM informed Finance of that fact in writing.
Two remaining steps were then taken on 23 August 1999 to complete the arrangements.
Finance told BHPTM of the write off and the set off against the amount on deposit and the directors of BHPTM resolved to record both the set off and the write off in the accounts of BHPTM.
That is what occurred.
D. BAD DEBT CLAIMS 
 Against that factual background, I turn to consider whether those parts of the debts written off by Finance in the 2000 year (see [2] above] were each allowable as a bad debt deduction.
(a) Legislation
 Section 25-35 of the 1997 Act provides: 
(1) You can deduct a debt (or part of a debt) that you write off as bad in the income year if: 
 
 
(a) it was included in your assessable income for the income year or for an earlier income year; or 
 
 
(b) it is in respect of money that you lent in the ordinary course of your * business of lending money .
...
 
 
Special rules affecting deductions under this section 
 
 
(5) The rules described in the table may affect your entitlement to deductions under this section, or may result in a deduction being reversed.
Provisions of the [1997 Act] are identified in normal text.
The other provisions, in bold , are provisions of the [1936 Act].
Rules affecting deductions for bad debts Item For the rules about this situation: See: 
 ... 
 3 A deduction under this section is reduced if the debt is forgiven and the debtor and creditor are companies under common ownership and agree for the creditor to forgo the deduction to a specified extent.
section 245-90 of Schedule 2C 4 ... 
 
 
(emphasis added).
(b) Section 25-35(1)(b)
 Two questions arise for consideration.
First, whether Finance was in the business of lending money (s 25-35(1)(b)) and, if so, whether each loan was made in the ordinary course of that business and secondly, whether the debt due by BHPTM was bad when written off.
The second issue is not relevant to the BHPDRI loan.
The Commissioner accepts that part of the debt due by BHPDRI to Finance and written off by Finance in the 2000 year was bad.
(i) Finance in the business of lending money?
Finance contends that it was, in the relevant years of income, in the business of lending money.
The Commissioner does not agree.
He concedes the evidence establishes that since at least the early 1980's: Finance did enter into borrowing transactions with third parties (see [13] above); Finance borrowed substantial sums of money from those third parties at commercial rates of interest; and Finance on lent those monies to related entities to fund both operational activity and new projects at a higher rate of interest (see [24] above) thereby earning substantial profits on which it paid income tax (see [24] above).

However, the Commissioner contends that Finance has not established that its activities amount to the carrying on of a business of lending money.
In particular, the Commissioner contends that the evidence does not establish that the activities of lending which in fact existed (see Schedule "A") were activities of Finance and not the activities of BHPB.
Put another way, the Commissioner contends that there was no evidence or insufficient evidence that Finance exercised a sufficiently independent corporate mind in respect of the lending activities recorded in its books and records for Finance to be carrying on a business of lending money: see, for example, Levin  Co Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioner (NZ) [1963] NZLR 801, 838-839.
The question whether the business being carried on by Finance was the business of lending money is a question of fact and characterisation: Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 88 FCR 151, 168-169, Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 , 469 and Ferguson v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 29 ; (1979) 26 ALR 307 , 319-320.
The essence of a business of "lending money" is not confined.
As Ryan J said in Ashwick (Qld) No 127 Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 853 at [4] , the expression "engaged in a business of lending money" "in the relevant provisions of the [1936 Act] and the [1997 Act] has a wide general application, capable of describing activities as diverse as those of a small pawnbroker with no treasury activities and those of a major national or international banking institution with a complex treasury, perhaps much more sophisticated and intricate than anything which the evidence suggests was engaged in or contemplated by [the relevant entity in the Ashwick litigation]".
Moreover, as Mason, Aickin and Wilson JJ said in AVCO Financial Services Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1982] HCA 36 ; (1982) 150 CLR 510 , 527 in connection with the finance company at issue in that case: 
The essence of the business of a finance company ... is the borrowing and lending of money, the rates of interest payable on money lent being significantly higher than the rates payable on the money borrowed, for it is from the difference in the interest rates that the company generates its profit, after making provision for bad debts.
There is therefore an important and material difference between borrowing by a finance company in the ordinary course of its business and borrowing by a manufacturing or trading company.
In general the finance company's borrowings provide money which it turns over at a profit.
Borrowing otherwise than for on-lending or for the repayment of funds borrowed for on-lending, that is, borrowing undertaken for capital rather than revenue purposes, as in [ Commercial and General Acceptance Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1977] HCA 47 ; (1977) 137 CLR 373] , is an exception to the general rule.
On the other hand, borrowing by a manufacturing or trading company is often undertaken to strengthen the capital or profit-earning structure of the company.
A finance company usually borrows in order to increase its working capital which is then turned over at a profit; the manufacturing or trading company frequently borrows to strengthen its permanent capital.
Finance contends that the concessions made by the Commissioner about the activities of Finance (see [91] above) are, themselves, sufficient to conclude that Finance is in the business of "lending money".
I agree.
However, the Commissioner contends that notwithstanding that on its face Finance was in the business of lending money, one should nevertheless conclude that Finance was not carrying on such a business because "Finance did not make its own decisions with respect to borrowing" and "the evidence [did] not establish that Finance exercised its corporate mind to make decisions about borrowing, particular lending activities, or any of the other activities which might be expected to have been involved in the carrying on of a systematic and organised activity sensibly able to be characterised as a business of lending money".
That contention raises a number of questions about the separate existence of a corporate entity and the relationship between a parent and its subsidiaries.
First, does the evidence of its books and records tendered by Finance gives rise to a presumption of regularity or independent existence?
This is so in most, if not all, common law jurisdictions: see, eg, Commissioner of Taxation v Bivona (1990) 21 FCR 562 , 567 (citing Mason J in Hope v Bathurst City Council [1980] HCA 16 ; (1980) 144 CLR 1 , 8); Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 ATR 1122 , 1126 (endorsing the opinion of Young J in Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd v Yelnah Pty Ltd (1986) 5 NSWLR 254 , 267 and stating that separate legal personality persists absent sham, a faade, a partnership between companies in a group in fact or law or the creation of a company to enable a legal or fiduciary obligation to be evaded or a fraud to be perpetrated); Hobart Bridge Co Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1951] HCA 33 ; (1951) 82 CLR 372 , 385; Freeman v Complex Computing Co Inc , [1997] USCA2 466 ; 119 F3d 1044 , 1052 (2 nd Cir 1997) (stating that the corporate form itself gives rise to a presumption of corporate independence and limited liability because it is necessary to encourage business development); American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue [1979] AC 676 , 684 (stating that any gainful use of assets by a corporation is prima facie the carrying on of a business); Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 , 469; see, eg, ss 18-21, 45A, 119, 124, 125, 1305 and 1306 of the Corporations Act (and the equivalent antecedent provisions) and s 69 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).
The Commissioner accepts this proposition in his written submissions.
That is not surprising.
Secondly, in addition to the facts conceded by the Commissioner (see [91] above), the facts summarised at [9] to [16] above were not in dispute, including but not limited to the fact that BHPB incorporated Finance in 1975 "for a legitimate business purpose", namely "to carry on the business of financier in all its branches both within and outside Australia", and that Finance was registered as a financial institution and short term dealer for the purposes of the Financial Institutions Duty legislation in Victoria and New South Wales: see also Bivona 21 FCR 562 , 567 and the other cases cited in [96] above.
What then is relied upon to displace a finding that Finance was a separate legal entity which carried on the business of lending money?
As noted, the Commissioner's objection is not so much that Finance does not carry on a business but that it is the parent company (BHPB) that carries on the business of lending money and Finance does not.
Put another way, that Finance was at the relevant time a "mere conduit" of its parent company, BHPB.
I reject those contentions.
Putting to one side whether the language of s 25- 35 imposes a requirement of independent corporate mind and decision making when there exists a separate legal entity that is engaged in the business of lending money (an assumption I make in favour of the Commissioner for the purposes of considering his argument), the Commissioner's argument fails for at least two reasons.
First, because that conclusion (ie that Finance was a "conduit" for its parent) "begs, not answers, the question whether the activities of [Finance] are correctly characterised as its principal business consisting of the lending of money" ( Bivona 21 FCR 562 , 567), and, in any event, because the submissions relied upon by the Commissioner are contrary to the facts and no less importantly, contrary to long established authority.
The Commissioner's argument directly raises questions about the weight or importance that should be given to the fact that the corporate boards of BHPB and Finance overlapped, that Finance relied upon the board of BHPB to approve capital expenditure on a particular project and that Finance relied upon the processes and procedures of BHPB in deciding the split between debt and equity for each project and, accordingly, the amount to be lent by Finance to the particular subsidiary with responsibility for that project.
It is to those issues I now turn.
The mere fact that corporate boards overlap is insufficient to defeat the presumption of separate existence: Walker v Wimborne [1976] HCA 7 ; (1976) 137 CLR 1 , 3-4 (as to the fact that the companies had common directors) and 6-7; see also Seltzer v IC Optics Ltd , 339 FSupp2d 601, 610-611 (DNJ 2004), United States v Bestfoods , [1998] USSC 65 ; 118 SCt 1876 , 1888 (1998) ("It is a well established principle [of corporate law] that directors and officers holding positions with a parent and its subsidiary can and do 'change hats' to represent the two corporations separately, despite their common ownership"); Leo v Kerr-McGee , Civ A No 93-1107(JEI), 1996 WL 254054 (D NJ, 10 May 1996) at *6 ("A significant degree of overlap between directors and officers of a parent and its subsidiary does not establish an alter ego relationship").
