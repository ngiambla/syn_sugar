 INTRODUCTION 
 Under s 511(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act"), the liquidator of Treecorp Australia Ltd (in liquidation) ("TAL") and Treecorp Limited (in liquidation) ("TL") (the "applicant") seeks an answer to the following question: 
Is the sum of $750,024.39 presently sitting in the accounts numbered 79-073-3371 and 083-347 81-435-5177 within the [National Australia Bank ("NAB")] in the name of TAL and TL plus interest accruing thereon ("Fund") part of the property of one or other of TL or TAL to be applied in satisfaction of that company's liabilities in accordance with the provisions of the [Act]?
The answer to that question is not straightforward.
FACTS 
 At the outset, a number of undisputed facts need to be stated.
The respondents to the application, Michael Joseph Dwyer and Alan Ross Jones ("the respondents") were added as parties by Finkelstein J on 25 November 2008 to represent themselves and all other investors in a managed investment scheme known as the "Clearwood Scheme".
That scheme was established under and regulated by Ch 5C of the Act.
The Clearwood Scheme concerned the establishment, management and conduct of all forestry services of a proposed 2,000 hectare "Clearwood" Radiata Pine plantation on Kangaroo Island ("the Project").
It was registered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") on 23 March 2000: Pt 5.C1 of the Act.
TAL (previously known as Forestry Management Holdings Limited) was the Responsible Entity of the Clearwood Scheme: s 601FB of the Act (the "Responsible Entity").
Its obligations were "to operate the scheme and perform the functions conferred on it by the scheme's constitution and [the] Act": s 601FB(1) of the Act.
The scheme's Constitution was dated 25 February 2000.
The Constitution was executed by TAL as Responsible Entity.
The recitals recorded that: TAL agreed to act as Responsible Entity of each project and for the applicants and growers who relate to each project, and to act "as trustee of the Funds" subject to the terms and conditions of the Constitution : cl 3.
Each project governed by the Constitution was registered under s 601EB of the Act as a managed investment scheme.
The Clearwood Scheme project was known as the Treecorp Clearwood Project 2000: cl 4.3.
Under the Constitution , TAL was required to create two separate funds in relation to each stage of the project --- the Application Fund and the Proceeds Fund: cl 5.1.
TAL was required to lodge in a trust Bank account ("the Application Fund") the Application Moneys received by it in respect of each Stage of the project to be held by TAL upon the trusts constituted by the Constitution : cl 5.2.
Each applicant had a proportional interest but not any interest in any particular part of the Application Fund: cl 5.4.
Initially, TAL held the fees in the Application Fund in a bank account numbered 06353310347919 with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia pursuant to cll 5.1 and 5.2 of the Constitution pending acceptance of the Applications.
"Applicant" was defined to mean a person whose application to enter the Management Agreement and the Sub-Lease (defined as the "Project Agreements") had been accepted by TAL: cl 1.
The method by which an applicant invested in the Clearwood Scheme was detailed in a Prospectus issued in April 2000 and prescribed by the Constitution .
A person had to apply (by completing and signing an application form and power of attorney) to sub-lease at least two identifiable one hectare allotments of land (called Woodlots) on Kangaroo Island, South Australia ("the Application") and pay an Application Fee of $8,250.00 per lot (stage 1) to TAL: cl 6.2 of the Constitution .
The Application Fees were the only payment investors had to make until harvest in about 26 years' time.
At the time of application, each applicant was provided with the Prospectus, a sub-lease and a Management Agreement.
All application fees received by TAL were placed in the Application Fund and held by it as bare trustee: cl 7.2 of the Constitution .
At that point in time, the scheme was registered with ASIC: see [3] above.
Those applications fees constituted "scheme property" (as that term is defined in ss 9 of the Act) held on trust by TAL for scheme members: s 601FC(2) of the Act.
The Constitution reinforced the statutory position that the Application Funds were held on trust for the applicants: cll 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 and 7.2 of the Constitution .
Upon acceptance of an Application, as prescribed in cll 9---12 of the Constitution : TAL was responsible for the preparation, stamping and delivery of the Project Agreements (defined as a Management Agreement and a Sub-Lease).
The Sub-Lease specified the Woodlots that TAL would allocate to a Grower; an applicant became a "Grower", was granted a Sub-Lease of land, entered into a Management Agreement and engaged TAL to harvest and market the enterprise carried out on the land.
When TAL was satisfied of matters specified in cl 13 of the Constitution (including that Minimum Subscription had been reached), TAL was entitled to release and did release the Application Moneys to itself as the Responsible Entity "in payment of the costs and expenses of [TAL] performing the duties and obligations of [TAL] under [the] Constitution and the relevant Management Agreements ...": cll 7.1, 13 and 14 of the Constitution .
At that point in time, the Application Fund which had been "scheme property" (ss 9 and 601FC of the Act) ceased to be scheme property.
It ceased because: cl 14.1 of the Constitution provided that: 
[TAL] will upon being satisfied of the matters specified in clause 13 release the Application Moneys in payment of the costs and expenses of [TAL] performing the duties and obligations of [TAL] under this Constitution and the relevant Management Agreements ...
 
 under the Management Agreement between TAL and each grower, the applicants (who were now known as growers) had contracted for that scheme property (the Application Fund) to be transferred to TAL in payment of prescribed work in fact undertaken and to be undertaken by TAL: cl 6 of the Management Agreement between TAL and each grower.
The work in fact undertaken and to be undertaken by TAL was prescribed in cll 4 and 5 of each Management Agreement as (1) Plantation Establishment and Development by 30 June 2001 (cl 4) and (2) assessment of the survival rate of the plantation within 2 years of completing the planting and if the survival rate was less than 90%, replanting all trees which failed to survive (cl 5).
Clause 14.2 of the Constitution provides that if the Application Moneys to be released pursuant to cl 14.1 were not released within 6 months after the date of the Project Agreements to which they relate, then TAL was entitled to refund the whole of the Application Moneys.
Three matters are worthy of note.
First, the pre-conditions to release to TAL were specified in cl 13 of the Constitution .
Secondly, to the extent that the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement are inconsistent with the terms and conditions in the Constitution or the Sub-Lease, then the Constitution prevails, followed by the Management Agreement and then the Sub-Lease: cl 25 of the Management Agreement.
Finally, no party submitted that TAL was not entitled to the funds in the Application Fund for non compliance with cll 13 and 14 of the Constitution , cll 4 and 5 of the Management Agreement or on any other basis.
It was a fee for the performance of its functions and a fee TAL was contractually entitled to receive and did receive: cf s 601FS(2) of the Act.
At first blush this seems an odd result.
Investors have contributed in excess of $1.68m with no obligation to contribute any further funds for 26 years in relation to a plantation which is not expected to generate income for many years and yet TAL, as the Responsible Entity, is entitled to all of the funds in the Application Fund at a point very close to the start of the scheme.
How then were the future steps in relation to the Plantation to be dealt with when the Application Fees were the only payment investors had to make for about 26 years?
The replanting obligation I have dealt with (see [12] above).
Plantation Maintenance, Harvesting and Marketing were treated separately under the Management Agreement.
For present purposes harvesting and marketing may be put to one side.
It is sufficient to note that under the Management Agreement, TAL was entitled to deduct from "Net Sales Proceeds" (defined as "the value of the Grower's Trees calculated by deducting from the mill door price direct and identifiable costs of harvesting, loading and cartage to the mill": cl 1 of the Management Agreement) not only the Maintenance Fee but also a Marketing Fee and the "Sub-Lease Rent" (defined in the Sub-Lease as 3% of the Net Sales Proceeds): cl 17 of the Management Agreement.
Plantation Maintenance was a responsibility of TAL "using its own funds" under cl 7 of the Management Agreement and, once performed, TAL was entitled to the "Maintenance Fee": cl 8 of the Management Agreement.
"Maintenance Fee" was defined in cl 1 of the Management Agreement to mean "the fee payable by the Grower to [TAL] expressed as a percentage of the Net Sales Proceeds described in Item 5 of the Schedule".
The percentage stipulated was 2%.
It is the maintenance obligation which lies at the heart of the issues in dispute.
Part E of the Constitution (cll 16---19) entitled "Maintenance" dealt specifically with the issue.
Clause 16 of the Constitution provided that TAL agreed that a "Plantation Services Agreement" ("PSA") would include (1) an obligation that TL (as agent for TAL) would carry out the obligations of TAL under the Management Agreements, (2) an obligation that TL would pay for that maintenance (referred to in cl 7 of the Management Agreements) and (3) an obligation that TL would provide "Security" in relation to that obligation.
The PSA contained such obligations: Pt C dealt with TL's obligations, Pt E dealt with funding and security.
I deal with these obligations in further detail later in these reasons for decision.
The appointment of TL by TAL was not unusual.
Under the Act, TAL was entitled to appoint an agent or otherwise engage a person to do anything that TAL was authorised to do in connection with the scheme: s 601FB(2).
However, in determining whether TAL had properly performed its duties under s 601GA(2) of the Act, TAL is taken to have done (or failed to do) anything that the agent or person engaged by TAL had done or failed to do: s 601FB(2) of the Act.
In relation to the Clearwood Scheme, TAL engaged TL as its agent to provide plantation services for which TAL was responsible.
TAL and TL shared common directors and provided forestry services to persons and entities unconnected with the Clearwood Scheme.
However, the obligation to maintain the Plantations remained with TAL "using its own funds".
How then was TAL's obligation to be discharged and discharged in such a way that the scheme and the investors in the scheme were protected?
Section E of the Constitution provided that before each year (defined as a "Stage" of the project in the Constitution ), TAL had to procure a written report from an Independent Forestry Consultant: cl 17.1.
In respect of each "Stage" of the project, the report was required to determine the aggregate amount required for the maintenance obligations for that stage referred to in cll 7.1 to 7.11 of the Management Agreements.
The method of calculation was prescribed: cl 17.2.
Having obtained a report in relation to each "Stage", TAL was obliged to procure from TL "Security" for each "Stage" on certain terms and conditions: cl 18 of the Constitution .
The "Security" was to be provided by TL at its own cost and, at the discretion of TAL, was to be either a bank guarantee or a fixed charge over a sum of money and accrued interest in a bank account in the name of TL with a bank approved by TAL to which TAL and TL were joint signatories: cl 18.1.
A form of deed of charge was provided --- a fixed charge: cl 3 of the Deed of Charge.
The amount of the Security was to be the value stated in the report by the Independent Forestry Consultant: cl 18.2.
In the present case, that amount was $2,200 per woodlot.
Neither party takes any issue with the report by the Independent Forestry Consultant or the amount of the security provided by TL.
Ultimately, TL granted the Responsible Entity (in this case, TAL) a Charge "to secure the performance by [it] of its obligations under the [PSA]": Recitals to the Deed of Charge.
The charge was to be first in priority and TL agreed not to grant any subsequent security over the proceeds of the Security: cl 18.3 of the Constitution .
The amount of the "Security" was $2,200 per woodlot.
That amount was deposited in an account subject to the Charge (defined in the Deed of Charge as "the Account" but referred to by the parties as the "TL Charge Account").
The amount of the Security could be reduced if TAL determined that "the moneys then secured exceed[ed] the amount required to fulfil the balance of the maintenance obligations of the Responsible Entity under cll 7.1 to 7.11 of the Management Agreement relating to the relevant Stage.
...": cll 18.6 and 19 of the Constitution .
The amount was not reduced.
Enforcement of the Security was dealt with in cl 18.5 of the Constitution in the following terms: 
If [TL] defaults in its obligations under the [PSA] and the Responsible Entity exercises its rights under the Security, the proceeds of the Security will be set off by the Responsible Entity towards the claim by the Responsible Entity against [TL] to fulfil the maintenance obligations of the Responsible Entity under clause 7.1 to 7.11 of the Management Agreement; ...
 
 The appointment of the applicants as liquidators of TL constituted an event of default under the Deed of Charge: cl 14 of the Deed of Charge.
ISSUE AND CONTENTIONS 
 I was asked to proceed to determine the question in [1] on the basis that the funds remained in the TL Charge Account subject to the charge.
What transpired in relation to the funds in the TL Charge Account was not adequately explained.
However, neither party contended that steps which occurred after the funds were withdrawn from the "TL Charge Account" affected or altered the real issue in the case --- whether the balance of that account (the TL Charge Account) formed part of the property of one or other of TL or TAL to be applied in satisfaction of that company's liabilities in accordance with the provisions of the Act?
The applicant contends that the whole of the balance standing to the credit of the TL Charge Account forms part of the property of TL or TAL to be applied in satisfaction of one or other of those company's liabilities although which entity was never made clear.
On the other hand, the respondents contend that the balance of the account was either (a) scheme property as that term is defined in s 9 of the Act or (b) held on trust for the scheme pursuant to a Quistclose trust for the benefit of the Scheme.
ANALYSIS 
 At the outset, two points must be made.
First, although the scheme is still registered with ASIC, it does not have a responsible entity and the land the subject of the sub-lease has been sold.
Secondly, the arguments of neither party gave the necessary attention to the relevant provisions of the Act, the Constitution or the Charge.
It is the Act, the Constitution and the Charge which govern entitlements to the funds the subject of the Charge.
Funds in the TL Charge Account
 TAL APPLICATION FUND 
 $8,250 
 
As noted earlier, the real issue is the balance that was standing to the credit of the TL Charge Account.
That balance arose because TL was to provide the Security: cl 18 of the Constitution and cl 14 of the PSA.
The source of funds to be deposited in the TL Charge Account as security was not prescribed.
It was common ground that the funds in the TL Charge Account were in fact provided by TAL sourced from the Application Fund.
