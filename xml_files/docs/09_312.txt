 INTRODUCTION 
 In two separate proceedings heard together and commenced respectively by the applicant ('Emirates') against the first respondent ('ACCC') and the second respondent ('Mr Samuel'), and by the first and second applicants, Singapore Airlines Limited and Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd (together 'Singapore Airlines'), against the ACCC, Emirates and Singapore Airlines challenge the decisions to issue, and the validity of, several notices issued by the ACCC and Mr Samuel pursuant to s 155(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').
Each notice primarily sought documents and information for an alleged price fixing agreement, arrangement, or understanding in relation to international air cargo services, purportedly contravening s 45 of the Act.
Relief is sought under a variety of provisions, including s 16 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act'), ss 21 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and s 163A of the Act.
To the extent any extension of time was required to bring an application under s 16 of the ADJR Act, I would have granted such an extension of time if the application was otherwise meritorious.
The applications of Emirates and Singapore Airlines are not identical, and do not raise the same grounds in relation to all the notices issued by the ACCC.
Nevertheless, it is convenient to deal compendiously with all grounds relied upon by the applicants, including the grounds relating to the alleged burden imposed upon the applicants by some of the notices and the alleged unreasonableness of the decisions to issue those notices.
Emirates received three s 155 notices and Singapore Airlines received five s 155 notices.
While the notices were not identical in form and content, the differences in wording were not considered as being material on the primary argument of Emirates and Singapore Airlines relating to the validity of the notices and, for the purpose of this judgment, I will refer to them collectively as the Notices unless otherwise specified.
As a prefatory matter, a few words must be directed to the question of the reach of the Act.
Initially, it appeared that these proceedings were going to concern the extent to which the Act extended to extraterritorial conduct.
