" 

 Mr Peter Yunghanns is the sole director of Merim.
Merim holds 192,308 convertible notes issued by Style with a face value of $250,000.
These notes were acquired in July 2007 and were part of an issue by Style to raise $10 million ("the capital raising " ).
Merim also holds 329,696 options to take up shares in Style.
Merim acquired the options in May 2007, and became a shareholder in Style on 16 June 2008.
Mr Yunghanns says that Merim holds 9,578,229 shares in Style representing in excess of 8% of its issued capital.
According to Mr Christopher Ritchie, Style's Chief Financial Officer, in June and July 2008 Merim acquired shares in Style itself or through nominees totalling 8,276,682 shares or thereabouts.
For present purposes, the precise shareholding of Merim in Style is not critical.
Merim was entered on Style's register of members on 14 August 2008.
Style is a public company and has been listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") since April 2004.
It specialises in the manufacture and distribution of strand woven bamboo products.
In May 2007, Style completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the shares it did not hold in Anji Ya Feng Bamboo Products Limited, a company based in Anji, China, which produces wooden flooring made from strand woven bamboo.
At sometime around the middle of 2007, prior to 3 July 2007, Mr Yunghanns met on several occasions with Mr Stephen Roux, a director of Style, and Mr Marcus Freeman, an employee of Bell Potter Securities Limited, lead manager for an offer of convertible notes Style was proposing to make.
Each of them told Mr Yunghanns that the money raised by the issue of the convertible notes was to be used to fund the acquisition of 5,500 hectares of a bamboo plantation in China.
Style's business activities were significantly affected by a number of circumstances in late 2007 and early 2008 and it suffered a downturn in revenue for the financial year ended 30 June 2008.
Despite early encouraging forecasts for revenue and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation ("EBITDA") in market announcements made to the ASX on 24 September and 31 October 2007, Style did not achieve those forecasts in the financial year ended June 2008.
Style contends that this was due to a number of events that occurred between November 2007 and March 2008 that were not foreseeable at the time that the forecasts were made.
These events included: 
(a) quality problems with the flooring product in North America; 
 
 
(b) delays in the installation and commissioning of machinery for its manufacturing facility in Anji; 
 
 
(c) decimation of a bamboo plantation in Wanzai, China that Style had acquired, due to an ice storm which resulted in Style deciding to exit the plantation arrangement; 
 
 
(d) administrative delays in shipping bamboo.
Style asserts that it announced each of these matters to the market in the form of announcements to the ASX on 31 January 2008 and 30 April 2008 and downgraded its forecasts as a result.
Merim says that its purpose in applying for an order to inspect Style's books is to investigate whether directors and officers of Style have exercised their powers reasonably, in good faith and for a proper purpose consistent with their statutory and fiduciary duties.
It also seeks to investigate whether Style's chairman and directors misled Style's members and the market regarding the performance of Style, and in particular, whether announcements made to the market containing financial forecasts were designed to coincide with the sale of certain options to acquire shares in Style by Style's chairman.
STYLE'S REPORTING OF FINANCIAL RESULTS 
 Style says that the capital raising in mid 2007 through an issue of convertible notes was for the purpose of acquiring a bamboo plantation in Wanzai, China and to provide working capital.
Relevantly, on 9 March 2007, Style made an announcement to the ASX stating that Style: 
 "... is looking into the feasibility of investing in bamboo plantations within the People's Republic of China with the objective of having increased control of our product raw material prices and supply.


 
 The company has rights to purchase certain parcels of land within China and the suitability of this land forms part of the feasibility study.


 
 The company will inform the market as to when any milestones or decision occur.
" 

 On 25 May 2007 Style made an announcement to the ASX in which it announced the signing, that day, of an agreement to acquire the remaining 50% of the shares in Anji Ya Feng Bamboo Products Limited for a total consideration of US$6 million payable by a cash consideration of US$2.5 million payable on 30 June 2007 and by the issue of 6,552,222 shares.
On 4 July 2007, Style made an announcement to the ASX: 
 "ACQUISITION FUNDING AND 1 st BAMBOO PLANTATION SECURED 
 The Board of Style is pleased to announce another significant strategic milestone in the Company's development.
The Company is in the final stage of a transaction to acquire a substantial area of land in China under a 30 year lease with existing bamboo plantations.


 
 The Company has announced previously its decision to pursue a bamboo plantations strategy designed to mitigate volume and price risk and ensuring security of raw material supply over the medium to long term.


 
 ACQUISITION FUNDING 
 The Company has raised $10.0 million through the issue of 7,692,308 Convertible Notes with a Face Value of $1.30 .


 
 The Purpose of the issue is primarily to finance the first plantation acquisition and provide working capital ..." 

 On 31 July 2007 Hartleys Limited, a broker based in Perth, issued a research report to clients regarding Style.
Hartleys Limited had previously prepared reports on Style in 2006 and 2007.
Although Style has no record of any documents being provided to Hartleys Limited at any time, the report of 31 July 2007 set out a forecast of actual results for Style for the year ended 30 June 2006, and forecasts for the financial years 2007, 2008 and 2009.
In particular, it forecast revenue for the 2007 financial year of $20.1 million, rising to $78.3 million and $123.4 million in 2008 and 2009 respectively, and EBITDA of $1.7 million in 2007 rising to $18.7 million and $35.4 million in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
The Hartleys report recommended Style as a "Buy" for potential investors, noting that recent investment highlights included the capital raising and the company being in the final stages of acquiring a 30-year lease in a bamboo plantation in Wanzai, China.
Style released its preliminary financial report for the year ended 30 June 2007 on 31 August 2007.
On 24 September 2007, Style sent a market update to the ASX, stating that it had received a confidential preliminary approach from a private equity firm.
The update set out Style's inaugural forecast, noting that the 2007 financial year revenue was $19.8 million and that revenue was forecast to rise to a range of $60 million to $80 million in the 2008 financial year.
EBITDA for the 2007 financial year was reported as $1.8 million and was forecast to rise to a range of $14 million to $20 million in the 2008 financial year.
On 27 September 2007, Style sent a letter to the ASX advising that Mr Gregory Johnson, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Style, had sold 6,499,839 listed options in Style through Bell Potter Securities Limited to Australian and international institutional and professional investors for $4,159,988 on 24 September 2007.
On 28 September 2007, Style released its audited financial results and annual report for the financial year ended 30 June 2007.
It reported that revenue for the 2007 financial year was approximately $19.9 million, net profit was $112,178 and EBITDA $1,700,440.
The annual report stated that options over approximately 6,900,000 shares in Style had been granted which were due to expire on 30 January 2009.
The report stated further that Style had commenced proceedings to collect outstanding debts of approximately $65,000 owed to it by two former franchisees and that although one of the parties to the dispute had launched a counterclaim against Style and the other party had notified its intention to lodge a counterclaim, Style was confident that it had a strong case against these parties.
On 31 October 2007, Style sent its September 2007 quarterly report to the ASX in which it reported its results for the first quarter of the 2008 financial year, recording a 5.1% increase in revenue over the previous quarter's revenue, and reported EBITDA of $766,000.
The report reaffirmed Style's guidance revenue range for the financial year 2008 of between $60 million to $80 million and its EBITDA range of $14 million to $20 million.
The report recorded that in the quarter ended 30 September 2007 Style had paid the consideration for the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the shares in Anji Ya Feng Bamboo Products Limited.
On 23 November 2007 Style announced to the ASX that the terms for the acquisition of the Wanzai plantation had been met.
These terms included a contract term to 2057 under a 50 year lease.
Style also announced that it expected a 30% improvement in the total cost of goods sold.
On 31 January 2008, Style announced to the ASX that forecast revenue for the financial year 2008 had been revised to $30 million to $35 million with EBITDA of $3 million to $3.6 million.
The announcement stated that the lower than projected revenue had arisen from the effects of a five month delay in the delivery by the supplier of the initial phase of the upgrade of the factory facilities in Anji and short-term quality issues that had delayed the schedule of shipments to the United States of America.
The announcement stated: 
 "As a result in this delay the Company has reduced its expectations for Q3 and Q4 sales BUT it expects that in Fiscal 2009 the full benefits of the plant expansion will be realised.
" 

 
On 29 February 2008, Style announced to the ASX its half-year results for the period ended 31 December 2007, recording revenue of $12.3 million and EBITDA of $590,396.
The announcement stated:
 
 
 "Whilst this is a good operating result for the period it is less than that projected in 24 September 2007, in line with advice provided on 31 January 2008 relating to delays in commissioning new machines and short term quality.


 
 Both issues have been resolved satisfactorily and the full benefits of resolving these issues should become apparent from July 2008.
" 

 On 30 April 2008 Style released a report to the ASX for the quarter ended 31 March 2008 which stated that revenue was $3.18 million for the quarter and that EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $1.8 million.
The announcement stated that the new machine lines had been installed and were operational, and that "the full benefits of the plant expansion will be realised at the commencement of fiscal year 2009.
" It also noted that the shipments of finished product for the March 2008 quarter were below the shipments for the corresponding period in 2007 due to the time taken to rebuild sales in the United States market following the quality and machine delay issues announced in January 2008.
The announcement also stated that the severe ice and snowstorms that had affected China in February had prevented employees from working at the Anji factory and that it was experiencing administrative delays with Chinese customs.
On 3 June 2008, Style released an investor update.
It included a section "Outlook" which stated: 
 "FY2008 was disrupted severely by various operational issues 

 
 Financial result likely to be a loss, revenue for the year will be similar to prior year revenue 

 
 1H2009: expect management to execute strategic roadmap 

 
 Management does not intend to give forecasts at this stage, but plans to report regularly on factual progress made.
" 

 On 21 July 2008, Style made a further announcement to the ASX which referred to the Wanzai plantation and the settlement of the franchisees dispute.
In relation to the Wanzai plantation, Style stated that it had reviewed the project after receipt of an independent report confirming substantial damage caused to the plantation by the ice storm in February 2008.
The report had concluded that the plantation would take approximately four years to regenerate.
The announcement stated: 
 "The Company has formed the view that these events render the Project not viable and have hence sought to exit the project.


 
 In relation to the above the Company wishes to advise that it is has reached in-principle agreement with the relevant government authorities in China to exit from its obligations relating to the Wanzai Plantation project.

 ... 
 The net effect on the Company of this agreement will be to write down the value of assets by $1.3 million representing a $784,295 reduction in the carrying value of Biological Assets and $242,000 of Land Rights Use.
The Company will benefit from a reduction in ongoing annual leasing costs of RMB 5 million ($769,000) and an absence of a commitment to develop the plantations and industrial site.
" 

 
In relation to the franchisee litigation, the announcement stated:
 
 "Following recent legal advice and further discussions with the franchisee representatives, the Company has reached an in principle settlement agreement that will involve the Company paying the franchisees $675,000 and the cessation of action by all parties.
" 

 The fourth quarter's results for Style were announced to the ASX on 31 July 2008.
Unlike previous quarterly statements the results announced did not disclose Style's revenue, EBITDA or profit or loss.
Instead, figures relating to the cash flow of the company were released.
On 25 August 2008, Merim instituted this proceeding.
On the same day, Style released an update by its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Peter Torreele (who had taken on the position in June 2008) and an update from the Chairman, Mr Johnson.
It also released its preliminary results for the year ended 30 June 2008.
MR YUNGHANNS' REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION 
 Mr Yunghanns sent a substantial number of emails and letters to various persons associated with Style in and between July and September 2008.
The emails contained not only requests for information, but also invective and personal criticisms of particular members of Style's board of directors.
Mr Yunghanns swore affidavits which were relied upon by Merim but he was not required by Style to attend for cross-examination.
In those circumstances, it is not appropriate to draw any conclusions from the sometimes intemperate nature of Mr Yunghanns' communications.
I do not intend to set out verbatim all their contents.
It is sufficient, for present purposes, to set out the requests for information that Mr Yunghanns has made to Style and the responses that he has received which he contends have been unsatisfactory.
On 4 July 2008, Mr Yunghanns sent an email to one of Style's non-executive directors, Mr Stephen Roux, asking him to explain how particular working capital (to a value of $14,163,000) as recorded in the quarterly cash statement for the period ended 31 December 2007 was applied.
The email stated: 
 "You represented to me, in the presence of others, that the money to be raised by way of the convertible note issue in Style Limited was to be used to fund the acquisition of 5,500 hectares of a bamboo plantation.
This statement is also made in a number of other announcements issued by the company and lodged with the Australian Securities Exchange.


 
 The money raised was not so applied, therefore, I view your representations upon which I and others relied, as misleading and deceptive.


 
 The company had a cash balance of $6,263,000 at 30 th June 2007.
It raised $10,000,000 during the 1 st quarter of 2008, yet, at the end of the first quarter, it had cash of $7,884,000 and no bamboo plantations.
How was the $8,379,000 applied?


 
 The quarterly cash statement for the period ending 31 December 2007 shows " other working capital " consumed of $14,163,000.


 
 I am unable to reconcile these figures [in the quarterly cash statement] with the published information.
Please explain the asset category to which the $14,163,000 was applied.
" 

 
This email was copied to a number of other persons including Mr Torreele, Style's Chief Executive Officer.
Mr Roux sent an email in response to Mr Yunghanns on 7 July 2008, acknowledging receipt of the email on 4 July 2008 and stating: 
 " [We] are considering it and formulating a response.
We hope to be in a position to respond to you tomorrow.
" 

 
On 4 July 2008, Mr Yunghanns also wrote to Mr Torreele seeking permission to inspect the books of the company.
The letter stated: 
 
 
 "In view of the circumstances set out in the email forwarded to Mr Stephen Roux today, and copied to you, I seek permission to inspect the books of the company.


 
 If the company refuses this request then I shall rely upon section 247A of the Corporations Act .
" 

 On 9 July 2008, Mr Yunghanns sent another email to Mr Roux (copied to Mr Johnson and Mr Torreele) setting out some of the statements Style had made previously to shareholders.
