 Gunns Limited ("Gunns") proposes to build and operate a pulp mill at Bell Bay in Tasmania.
When the mill is operative effluent from the production process is to be discharged into Bass Strait some kilometres offshore.
It is possible that such discharge may have an adverse effect on an area of Bass Strait which forms part of the Commonwealth marine environment.
In order to undertake the construction of the mill it was, therefore, necessary that Gunns first obtained the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts ("the Minister") under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) ("the Act").
The Minister gave his approval on 4 October 2007.
The applicant ("LFF") has been found to be a person aggrieved by that decision within the meaning of s 487(3) of the Act: see Lawyers for Forests Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 588.
LFF seeks judicial review of the Minister's decision on a number of grounds.
The review is sought under both the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ("the ADJR Act") and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
I have come to the view that none of the grounds, relied on by LFF, is sustainable and that its application should, accordingly, be dismissed.
THE LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT 
 The Act includes amongst its objectives the protection of the environment and the conservation of biodiversity: see s 3(1)(a) and (c).
In order to achieve its objects the Act seeks to protect native species and ecosystems by various means: see s 3(2)(e).
The legislative scheme requires Ministerial approval before any person takes any action that will have or is likely to have a significant impact on specified matters of national environmental significance.
A person who is proposing to take some action which the person considers may be what the Act describes as a "controlled action", is required to refer the proposal to the Minister so that the Minister may determine whether or not the proposed action is a "controlled action": see s 68.
A "controlled action" is action which is prohibited by Part 3 of the Act: see s 67.
When a referral is made under s 68, the Minister is required to determine whether the action is a "controlled action" and, if so, which of the proscriptions imposed in Part 3 of the Act apply: see s 75.
If the Minister determines that the proposed action is "controlled action", Part 9 requires that the environmental impact of the action be assessed, using a method determined by the Minister under s 87 of the Act.
Once the assessment has been made the Minister must determine whether or not to approve the proposed action: see ss 130(1) and 133.
When deciding whether or not to approve "controlled action" the Minister is required to have regard to matters relevant to applicable "controlling provisions" and economic and social considerations: see s 136.
The Minister is obliged to have regard to the principles of ecologically sustainable development which include what is known as "the precautionary principle": see ss 3A, 136 and 391.
The Minister is also required to consider the written submissions of the designated proponent, the written advice on the proposal provided by the Minister's Department, any public comment on the proposal and any information which the Minister has available to him or her concerning the anticipated impacts of the proposed action: see ss 95B, 95C, 131A and 136 of the Act.
The Act prescribes tight time limits on each stage of the process prior to the final stage at which the Minister is called on to make a final decision on whether or not to grant approval.
The statutory processes have been said by Branson and Finn JJ to involve "studied haste": see The Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources [2007] FCAFC 175 ; (2007) 243 ALR 241 at 262 [84] .
THE BACKGROUND FACTS 
 On 2 April 2007 Gunns made a referral, relating to its proposed pulp mill, to the Minister, under s 68 of the Act.
On 2 May 2007 the Minister determined that the proposed action was "controlled action".
Relevantly, he determined that the controlling provisions were ss 23 and 24A of the Act which dealt with Commonwealth marine areas.
He directed that the method of assessment should be by way of preliminary documentation.
On 8 May 2007 Gunns advertised the preliminary documentation.
Public comment was invited by 5 June 2007.
Two hundred and seventy-nine submissions were received.
On 4 July 2007 Gunns sent its response to those submissions to the Minister: see s 95B of the Act.
The Department considered the submissions and other material and prepared a recommendation report which it submitted to the Minister on 17 August 2007: see s 95C of the Act.
The report recommended that the Minister approve Gunns taking the proposed action subject to certain conditions.
In making the recommendation the Department had regard to a number of scientific reports.
These included: On 19 August 2007 the proposed decision and conditions were published on the Departmental website.
Public comment was invited under s 131A of the Act.
This invitation led to over 30,000 comments being received from members of the public.
One of these responses was a joint submission from Drs Godfey, Raverty and Wadsley to which was attached a paper by Dr Wadsley.
On 10 August 2007 the Minister invited the Chief Scientist of Australia to review and report on the scientific aspects of the proposal.
The Chief Scientist formed a panel of experts to assist him to conduct the review.
On 29 August 2007 the Minister extended the time for making his final decision so that he would have time to consider both the public submissions and the Chief Scientist's report.
On 24 September 2007 the Chief Scientist sent his report to the Minister.
He subsequently expressed his agreement with the terms of the draft approval decision which had been recommended by the Department.
On 4 October 2007 the Minister determined to grant final approval to the proposal subject to a range of conditions.
He gave his reasons for so doing on 1 November 2007.
The Minister's decision approved Gunns proposal "to construct and operate a bleached Kraft pulp mill at Bell Bay, Tasmania, and associated infrastructure ..." subject to 48 conditions.
There is reference in many of these conditions to an "EIMP".
This is an Environmental Impact Management Plan which Gunns is required, by some of the other conditions, to develop in order to manage, monitor and respond to the environmental impacts occasioned by the operation of the pulp mill.
It will be convenient to return to the conditions relating to the development and approval of the EIMP after identifying the conditions to which most of the argument was directed.
Conditions 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40 and 42 are of particular relevance to the present application.
They read: 
 "31) The volume of wastewater effluent discharged from the operation of the pulp mill to the marine environment must not be more than 64 megalitres per day on an average monthly basis.


 Gunns Limited must sample the effluent discharge from the operation of the pulp mill for the parameters in the tables below on at least a daily basis.
The pulp mill must not operate if the monthly average effluent concentrations from the pulp mill exceed the maximum limits provided in the tables below.
These limits may be revised in the final EIMP if agreed by the Independent Expert Group and approved by the Minister as a result of further studies.
Maximum limits and trigger levels on additional effluent contaminants (for example, nitrate, resin acid and colour) will also be developed in the EIMP in accordance with Schedule 2.
