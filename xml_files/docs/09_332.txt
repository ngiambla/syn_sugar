 BACKGROUND 
 Factual Background
 Before the Court are Notices of Motion filed by the applicants ('Roadshow') and the respondent ('iiNet').
To understand the issues raised by such motions, it is necessary to describe the claims made by Roadshow against iiNet in the proceedings.
Roadshow's Amended Statement of Claim ('ASOC') pleads that Roadshow has copyright in a large catalogue of cinematograph films, which include, but are not limited by, 86 identified films for which copyright is specifically pleaded (hereafter both catalogue and identified films will be referred to as the 'films').
IiNet is a general purpose internet service provider.
It is acknowledged that iiNet provides both internet services and ' listed carriage services ' within the meaning of s 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth).
Roadshow alleges that subscribers or other users of iiNet use peer to peer software, such as that based on the BitTorrent protocol (which will be the software discussed in this judgment), and iiNet's internet facilities to download copies of Roadshow's films.
The downloading occurs as a result of the electronic transmission of minute packets of data which can be assembled to make up a file containing a film.
Having been downloaded, Roadshow claims that such films are made available from those iiNet users' computers and shared with the internet at large via iiNet's provision of internet facilities.
Specifically, Roadshow alleges that infringement of copyright in its films results from any one or all of the acts specified below, each act of which uses iiNet's facilities for the purpose of transmission.
Roadshow alleges, firstly, that the act of having a copy of a film stored on an iiNet user's computer which can be downloaded by other users of BitTorrent-based software constitutes an active infringement of Roadshow's copyright by that user since the film is being made available online.
Secondly, by the transfer via iiNet's facilities of packets of data of a file containing a film in response to a request made between BitTorrent users, Roadshow claims such iiNet users communicate the film to the public thereby committing an act of infringement.
Thirdly, having a copy of the film on an iiNet user's computer following its download in itself constitutes an act of infringement.
Fourthly, Roadshow claims that iiNet has authorised each of such acts by its users.
In support of its claims of copyright infringement, Roadshow relies upon evidence adduced by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ('AFACT').
The AFACT has retained the services of DtecNet Software APS ('DtecNet'), a company incorporated in Denmark, which undertakes the investigation of suspected unauthorised sharing and transfer of copyright files by users of peer to peer file sharing systems such as BitTorrent.
An affidavit of Kristian Lkkegaard sworn on 25 February 2009 describes the DtecNet technology and its method of investigation.
The affidavits of Aaron Guy Herps sworn on 9 December 2008 and 23 February 2009 and Gregory Donald Fraser sworn on 23 February 2009 explain the process that Mr Herps and Mr Fraser undertook to connect with BitTorrent users and to download copies of the films using iiNet's facilities.
Roadshow claims that the evidence provided by DtecNet, which includes the dates and times of when the films were downloaded and the internet protocol addresses ('IP addresses') of the BitTorrent users from which those films are sourced, is sufficient to enable iiNet to identify which of their users are engaging in such conduct.
Relevant Principles
 Each Notice of Motions seeks, as primary relief, the making of orders striking out sections of the pleadings under O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) ('the Rules') or granting summary judgment under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Court Act') in relation to specific parts of the pleadings.
Section 31A of the Court Act
 Section 31A of the Court Act (s 31A) relatively provides: 
 (1) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of the proceeding if:
 (a) the first party is prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.
(2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if:
 (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and
 (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.
(3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be:
 (a) hopeless; or
 (b) bound to fail;
 for it to have no reasonable prospect of success.

 There has been a judicial difference of opinion in two recent decisions of the Full Court concerning the interpretation of s 31A: see Jefferson Ford Pty Ltd v Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd and Others [2008] FCAFC 60 ; (2008) 167 FCR 372 and Wills v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2009) 253 ALR 228.
The test which was applied generally on an application for summary judgment prior to insertion of s 31A in the Court Act was that referred to in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (N.S.W.
) and Others [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125.
At 129 Barwick CJ determined the test to be applied where an application is made to strike out a claim.
His Honour said: 
 At times the test has been put as high as saying that the case must be so plain and obvious that the court can say at once that the statement of claim, even if proved, cannot succeed; or "so manifest on the view of the pleadings, merely reading through them, that it is a case that does not admit of reasonable argument" ; "so to speak apparent at a glance".

 Section 31A of the Court Act has been said to impose a less stringent test than that described in General Steel Industries and may be understood to enable summary dismissal of unmeritorious matters: see Jewiss v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 65 ATR 222 at [26] and Gordon J in Jefferson Ford at [124].
Gordon J at [126] said that ' whether a proceeding or part of a proceeding has no reasonable prospects of success ' requires: 
 1. identification of the cause of action pleaded;
 2. identification of the pleaded facts said to give rise to that cause of action;
 3. a review of the evidence (if any) tendered in support of the claim for judgment;
 4. identification of the defence pleaded;
 5. identification of any facts pleaded which are said to give rise to the defence; and
 6. a review of the evidence (if any) tendered in defence of the claim.

 Gordon J distinguished between ' hopeless ' cases and those ' without reasonable prospects of success .
' Her Honour said (at [132]): 
 By distinguishing between "hopeless" cases and those without reasonable prospects for success, the statute makes clear that the court need not (indeed, must not) refuse summary judgment on the basis of a factual dispute said to arise only from a plausible, as opposed to a reasonable, inference.

 Despite some difference in the judicial approach of Finkelstein J and Gordon J in Jefferson Ford , the Court is prepared to follow the observations of Gordon J as providing a practical guide to the interpretation of s 31A of the Court Act.
The conflict between Gordon J and Rares J in Jefferson Ford (see [129], [73]) and which was not resolved in Wills , relating to whether judges retain a general discretion to enter summary judgment under s 31A, is irrelevant to the current judgment, and accordingly it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the conflicting judicial opinions.
The observations of French J in Fortron Automotive Treatments Pty Ltd v Jones (No 2) [2006] FCA 1401 at [19] - [21] are particularly useful in distinguishing between the requirements for a summary judgment under s 31A and a strike out as discussed below.
His Honour observed that s 31A renders judgment, and is thus distinct from a strike out, which can be followed by the amendment of a pleading.
Thus judgment should only be entered where no amendment of pleadings or particulars is possible, that is, where there is a defect in the pleadings which cannot be cured.
