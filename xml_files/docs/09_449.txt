 The point in dispute lies in a narrow compass: Does legal professional privilege attach to correspondence from Maurice Blackburn Pty Ltd (MBC), a firm of solicitors, to holders and former holders of securities in Brookfield Multiplex Limited and Brookfield Multiplex Funds Management Limited (together, Multiplex), about the merits and progress of a potential class action against Multiplex?
The resolution of this dispute raises for consideration the scope of legal professional privilege prior to any retainer between a solicitor and his client.
Following the hearing I declined to allow production of the disputed communications, with minor exceptions.
What follow are my reasons.
Legal professional privilege has its origins in Elizabethan times: see Berd v Lovelace (1577) Cary 62; [21 ER 33].
Strangely, certain aspects of the privilege are still to be settled.
The current view is that there are two branches of legal professional privilege --- they are usually referred to as advice privilege and litigation privilege.
Advice privilege is concerned with direct communications between a lawyer and his client, or their respective agents or employees: Greenough v Gaskell [1833] EngR 333 ; (1833) 1 My  K 98; [39 ER 618] ; Anderson v Bank of British Columbia [1876] 2 Ch D 644 , 649.
Initially the privilege was confined to communications in relation to existing or contemplated litigation: The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company v Quick (1878) 3 QBD 315 ; Wheeler v Le Marchant (1881) 17 Ch D 675.
That is no longer the case: Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674.
The rationale for advice privilege is to promote "the public interest because it assists and enhances the administration of justice by facilitating the representation of clients by legal advisers": Grant v Downs at 685.
