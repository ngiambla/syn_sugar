 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China (China).
He arrived in Australia on 15 February 2008.
On 7 March 2008 he applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a Protection (Class XA) visa.
A delegate of the first respondent formed the view that the appellant is not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 , amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 1967 (Convention) and consequently, on 17 May 2008, refused to grant the visa.
On 18 June 2008, the appellant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (Tribunal) for a review of that decision.
On 13 August 2008, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa.
On 30 September 2008, the appellant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) seeking a review of the Tribunal's decision.
This appeal is against the judgment of the Federal Magistrate of 6 March 2009 dismissing an application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision: WZANI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  Anor [2009] FMCA 129.
