 
 1 On 4 July 2008, a notice of motion was filed on behalf of Hazel Brown, Glen Colbung, Ken Colbung, Rita Dempster and Mingli Wunjurri Nungala (the applicant movers), relating to the Wagyl Kaip native title claim.
The applicant movers seek orders that they replace the current applicant in the native title determination claim WAD 6286 of 1998 (the Wagyl Kaip applicant) pursuant to s 66B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act).
This application is part of a consolidated proceeding with WAD 6134 of 1998, which is known as the Southern Noongar claim.
2 Each of the applicant movers is a member of the current Wagyl Kaip applicant.
There are five other people who are members of the current Wagyl Kaip applicant, but who are not included in the proposed new Wagyl Kaip applicant.
Two of those people are deceased.
The other three are Kevin Miller, Samuel Miller and Mark Smith (the respondents) and they oppose the motion filed by the applicant movers.
The motion is not opposed by any other party to the proceeding.
I made a referral under O 80 of the Federal Court Rules in respect of the representation of the respondents.
