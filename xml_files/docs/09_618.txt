 MAGISTRATE'S DECISION 
 On 3 April 2009, Magistrate GN Calder, sitting in the Western Australian Magistrates Court at Perth, determined, pursuant to s 19(2) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act), that the applicant, Vincent Thomas O'Donoghue, is an eligible person for surrender for extradition to Ireland in relation to the extradition offences of obtaining property by false pretences (8 counts) and fraudulent conversion (8 counts).
REVIEW APPLICATION 
 By application, dated 3 April 2009, the applicant seeks review of the Magistrate's decision pursuant to s 21(1) of the Act.
By s 21(2) of the Act the Court following review may by order confirm the order of the Magistrate or quash the order and direct the Magistrate to order the release of the person (in the case of an order under subs 19(9), or order by warrant in the statutory form, that the person be committed to prison to await surrender under a surrender warrant or temporary surrender warrant or release pursuant to an order under subs 22(5), in the case of an order under subs 19(10)).
In conducting a review the Court shall have regard only to the material that was before the Magistrate: s 21(6)(d) of the Act.
It follows from these provisions that the review in this Court is in the nature of a rehearing limited to the materials that were before the Magistrate.
In other words, the review is not a fresh hearing at which new materials or evidence can be introduced.
The applicant submits that upon the rehearing, the Court should find that the documents produced by Ireland to support its extradition request fail to identify conduct on the part of the applicant sufficient to: As a consequence the applicant submits the Court should quash the order of the magistrate and order his release.
EXTRADITION REQUEST 
 As explained by the Full Federal Court in Harris v Attorney General of the Commonwealth (1994) 52 FCR 386 at 389, in summary form the scheme of the Act leading to extradition is as follows: 
 The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional warrant under s 12(1) or by the giving of a notice under s 16(1).
Once arrested, the person is required by s 15 to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s 19.
Where a person is on remand under s 15 and the Attorney-General has given a notice under s 16(1), provision is made under s 19 for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender.
If eligibility is so determined by the magistrate, provision is made by s 22 for the Attorney-General to decide whether the person is to be surrendered.

 In this case a warrant for arrest under subs 12(1) of the Act and reg 3 of the Extradition Regulations was issued on 21 December 2004 for the arrest of the applicant.
The warrant was issued on the application made in the statutory form on behalf of Ireland, an extradition country for the purposes of the Act.
That application alleged that the applicant is an extraditable person for the purposes of the Act in relation to Ireland.
On 5 January 2005, the Hon Philip Maxwell Ruddock MP, Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia signed a Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request (Notice) under the Act addressed to the Magistrate before whom the person named in the Notice is brought.
That Notice was issued by the Attorney-General under subs 16(1) of the Act and stated that an extradition request had been received from Ireland in relation to the applicant for the following extradition offences: The Extradition (Ireland) Regulations made 13 March 1989 by reg 5 provides that the Act applies in relation to Ireland subject to the Treaty on Extradition (Treaty) between Australia and Ireland done at Dublin on 2 September 1985 (being the treaty a copy of the text of which is set out in the Schedule).
Article V of the Treaty provides by paras 2(a), (d) and (e) that: A request for extradition emanating from Ireland shall be supported: 
 (a) if the person is accused, or has been convicted in his absence, of an offence by a warrant for the arrest or a copy of the warrant for the arrest of the person, a statement of each offence for which extradition is sought and a statement of the acts or omissions which are alleged against the person in respect of each offence:
 (d) in all cases, by a copy of the relevant provisions of the statute, if any, creating the offence or a statement of the relevant law as to the offence, including any law relating to the limitation of proceedings, as the case may be, and in either case a statement of the punishment that can be imposed for the offence: and
 (e) in all cases, by information or documents which will help to establish that the person whose surrender is sought is the person accused of or convicted of the offence.

 In this case, the First Secretary of the Embassy of Ireland in Canberra, being an officer in and of Ireland, provided with the relevant request a certificate which certified that documents attached to the certificate had been prepared in support of a request by Ireland for the extradition from Australia of the applicant, an Irish citizen, in order that he may be dealt with by the Irish Courts in accordance with law.
The certificate itself was signed and sealed at Dublin on 12 May 2004 by a person authorised by law to authenticate the Seal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland pursuant to the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 (Ireland).
In particular the certificate had attached documents in purported compliance with the requirements of paras 2(a), 2(d) and 2(e) of Art V of the Treaty.
