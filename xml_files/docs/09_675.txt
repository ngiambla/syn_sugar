 The amended application for relief filed by the applicants in these proceedings arises from claimed breaches of covenants in a share sale agreement, breaches of guarantees related to that agreement, and alleged breaches of ss 180(1) , 181 (1) and 182 (1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act ").
The applicants claim by way of relief: Specific performance of the guarantee accompanying the share sale agreement.
Damages for breach of a share sale agreement and the guarantee.
Damages for breach of duty as a director pursuant to s 1317H of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
Interest pursuant to a share sale agreement or pursuant to s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
Costs.
The respondents submitted that the applicants have abandoned aspects of their claim relating to breaches of duty under the Corporations Act .
Although there was no express abandonment of the Corporations Act claims by the applicants, in my view the respondents' submission is substantiated by the facts that: I consider it appropriate to treat this aspect of the applicants' claim as abandoned.
BACKGROUND 
 Relevant Parties
 At all material times, the first applicant ("Forbes Asia") was a company incorporated in Singapore, and a subsidiary of Teamsphere Ltd which was also a Singapore-based company.
Mr Poh Kiat, who gave evidence on behalf of the applicants at the hearing of this matter, and who was a key witness in these proceedings for the applicants, was at all material times Managing Director of both Forbes Asia and Teamsphere Ltd. The second applicant ("Forbes Australia") was, at all material times, a company incorporated in Australia which carried on business both within and outside Australia.
Prior to September 1997, Forbes Australia was a specialised company based in Brisbane which provided services to the concrete industry, notably in relation to establishment of plants and the construction of equipment for transportation of concrete.
After the sale of shares of Forbes Australia in September 1997 the company continued to carry on business in the same industry.
Until September 1997 the owners of the shares in Forbes Australia were two companies, Pearlbunch Pty Ltd ("Pearlbunch") and Talrate Pty Ltd ("Talrate"), both of which were controlled by the first respondent, Mr Forbes, as sole director.
Mr Forbes was sole shareholder of Pearlbunch, and was also the sole director and (with Mrs Forbes) a shareholder of another company, Forbes Screens Pty Ltd ("Forbes Screens").
At the time of the share sale agreement executed by Forbes Asia as purchaser and Pearlbunch and Talrate as vendors on 22 September 1997 by which the shares in Forbes Australia were transferred to Forbes Asia ("share sale agreement"), Mr Forbes was the managing director and chief executive officer of Forbes Australia.
He retained this position until 22 February 2000.
At all material times Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes were joint owners of certain property described as Lot 8 on RP 229240, County of Stanley, Parish of Toombul ("Lot 8").
Until 15 June 2000, Forbes Screens owned an adjoining property ("Lot 9").
Leases of Lot 8 and Lot 9
 On 17 September 1997 Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes entered into a lease of Lot 8 with Forbes Australia.
On 22 September 1997 Forbes Screens entered into a lease of Lot 9 with Forbes Australia.
Share Sale Agreement
 The shares in Forbes Australia were transferred to Forbes Asia on 22 September 1997 for a purchase price of $3.9 million.
The share sale agreement took place following what appear to be extensive negotiations during July, August and September 1997 between the parties.
The initial negotiations in respect of the acquisition took place primarily between Forbes Asia represented by Mr Poh, and the interests of the vendors of the shares in Forbes Australia represented by Mr Forbes.
Formal discussions in the period prior to execution of the share sale agreement involved the parties' legal representatives (including Mr Steven Grant for Mr Forbes and the vendors and Mr Freddy Chan for the purchasers) and accounting advisers.
I shall return to consider these negotiations later in this judgment, because findings in respect of the negotiations are important in relation to a number of the applicants' claims in this case.
Key provisions of the share sale agreement for the purposes of these proceedings were cl 2.3 and cl 3.3, Annexure 1 and cl 3.4.
The purchase price for the shares in Forbes Australia was to be paid in three tranches or "cash injections".
Clause 2.3 of the share sale agreement provided for the circumstances of the payment of third cash injection in the amount of $1,099,999.
Of that amount, $500,000 (referred to as "the Retention Sum") was to be retained in escrow unless the terms of cl 3.4 were satisfied and the balance of the purchase price was paid.
Clause 3.3 provided as follows: 
 3.3 The Vendors shall guarantee, ensure and cause the Company to achieve the following audited profits before tax during the following financial years of the Company provided always that the audited said profit before tax is calculated by reference to the formula set out in Annexure 1 attached hereto:- 

 
 3.3.1 For the financial year ending 31st December 1997 --- A$1,300,000.00 

 
 3.3.2 For the financial year ending 31st December 1998 --- A$1,400,000.00 and 

 
 3.3.3 For the financial year ending 31st December 1999 --- A$1,500,000.00 

 
 For the financial year ending 31st December 2000, the Vendors shall use its best endeavour to cause the Company to achieve an audited profit before tax of A$1,600,000.00.


 (The guarantees referred to in cl 3.3 were referred to throughout the proceedings, and shall be referred to in this judgment, as "the profit guarantees".
) Annexure 1 to which cl 3.3 referred provided: 
 Clause 3.3: Formula for calculating the audited Profit before tax of the Company:- 

 
 The calculation for the audited profit before tax of the Company shall be in accordance to Australian Accounting Standards as per audited financial statements but excluding extraordinary items, abnormal items, gain or loss on disposal and/or revaluation of assets, expenses relating to research and development, provisions for long service leave and additional depreciation and amortisation resulting from the value of any item (for depreciation or amortisation purposes) being increased over that item's value for that purpose as at 30 June 1997.


 In summary, cl 3.4 required the vendors' solicitors to hold the $500,000 Retention Sum for 365 days from the date of the agreement in their trust account, following which the monies would be withdrawn and specifically applied towards payment of certain accounts.
Side Letters Containing Written Indemnity and Guarantee Agreement
 On 22 September 1997, the same day as execution of the share sale agreement, Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes executed two "side letters".
Forbes Guarantee
 The first side letter executed by the respondents (the "Forbes Guarantee" also referred to in the proceedings as the "1st Lot 8 Side Letter") was addressed to Forbes Asia.
It recited the execution of the share sale agreement and the lease of Lot 8.
The document then continued: 
 1.
We hereby unequivocally and irrevocably admit and acknowledge that:- 

 
1.1 the Vendors are our nominee and it was at our requests that you agreed to enter into the SS Agreement with the Vendors;
 
 
1.2 in view of paragraph 1.1, all the warranties and representations and covenants and obligations made or assumed by the Vendors under the SS Agreement are actually our representations and warrants and our covenants and obligations; and
 
 
1.3 as regards the Vendor's (and hence our) covenants under Clause 3.3 of the SS Agreement, it was agreed that in the event that the audited profits before tax of FEH shall fall short of the amount guaranteed by the Vendors (and hence us), we, as Lessors under the Lease shall agree to reduce the total rent ("Rent") payable by FEH during the twelve (12) months period immediately following the last day of that particular financial year of FEH where the amount of the audited profit before tax so guaranteed is not achieved.

 2.
In consideration of you entering into the SS Agreement with the Vendors at our requests, we hereby agree, covenant and undertake as follows:- 

 
2.1 guarantee the performance and compliance by the Vendors of all the Vendor's obligations and covenants under the SS Agreement and:-
 
 
2.1.1 do, execute and perform such things, documents and acts as requested by you at any time and from time to time to ensure that the Vendors shall so comply with their obligations under the SS Agreement; and
 
 
2.1.2 indemnify you for all loss and damages suffered and costs and expenses incurred by you as a result of the Vendor's failure to so comply with the Vendor's obligations and covenants under the SS Agreement; and to pay to you on demand such losses and damages and costs and expenses;
 
 
2.2 as regards the reduction of the yearly rent for the Lease under paragraph 1.3 above, we agree to and covenant in terms of the provisions set out in paragraph 3 below; and
 
 
2.3 use our best endeavours to ensure that the suppliers and trade creditors of FEH and Forbes Industries Pty Ltd ("FI") will accept the take over of FI's debts with them by FEH's new subsidiary, Forbes Industries (Australia) Pty Ltd ("FIA") and that such suppliers and trade creditors shall continue to offer to FIA such credit terms which are not less favourable than those now enjoyed by FI.
Reduction of Rent under the Lease 
 
 
3.1 If the audited profit before tax ("Pretax Profit YE/97") of FEH calculated in the manner as provided under the SS Agreement for the period 1.1.97 to 31.12.97 ("YE/97") shall not be more than A$1,300,000.00 ("P/Profit Target") then we hereby irrevocably and unequivocally discharge and release FEH of all obligations to pay to us such proportion of the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.98 to 31.12.98 ("YE/98") which is equivalent to the difference ("Profit Shortfall") between the said P/Profit Target for YE/97 and the said actual audited Pretax Profit YE/97.
If the Profit Shortfall exceeds 100% of such Rent, then we shall release and discharge FEH of FEH'S obligations and liabilities to pay to us the Rent for YE/98.
If the Profit Shortfall is less than such Rent, then FEH shall deduct such Profit Shortfall from the Rent for YE/98.
Such deductions shall be recovered by FEH by deductions of the same amount to the Rent payable by FEH to us under the Lease (for the YE/98).
3.2 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.99 to 31.12.99 ("YE/99"), the same formula set out in paragraph 3.1 above shall apply save and except the following difference:-
 
 
3.2.1 the Rent for YE/99 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease; and
 
 
3.2.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/98 shall be A$1,400,000.00
 
 
3.3 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.2000 to 31.12.2000 ("YE/2000") the same formula set out in paragraph 3.1 above shall apply save and except the following differences:-
 
 
3.3.1 the Rent for YE/2000 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease:
 
 
3.3.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/99 shall be A$1,500,000.00
 
 
 4.
We hereby waive all our rights to defences available to (sic) in respect of the above guarantee and indemnity under the laws of Queensland, and shall pay to you on demand all monies, losses and damages and costs and expenses, suffered or incurred by you as a result of the Vendors' breach or failure to comply with the Vendors' obligations and covenants under the SS Agreements.


 
 5.
All covenants and agreement herein made by us are so made by us jointly and severally and binding on our respective successors-in-title, heirs and personal representatives.


 Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee
 The second side letter executed by the respondents (the "Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee" also referred to in the proceedings as the "2nd Lot 8 Side Letter") was addressed to Forbes Australia.
It recited the execution of the lease of Lot 8 and continued: 
 In consideration of your agreeing to enter into the Lease with us at our requests, we hereby agree that we are obligated to you to effect the adjustments of Rent and/or the monthly instalments of the Rent as provided in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of our above letter to Forbes Engineering (Asia) Pte Ltd and you are entitled to make such adjustments in your payment of rent to us.
In the event that under such adjustments we are required to refund to you such portion of the rent as have been paid by you to us, we shall pay to you on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.
If we shall have defaulted in such refund, without prejudice to your rights against us for our said default, we shall pay interest at the rate provided under Clause 6.8 of the Lease on such refund calculated from the date of our receipt of your demand until the date of actual payment of such refund.


 Forbes Screens
 On 22 September 1997, the same date as the execution of the two Lot 8 side letters, Forbes Screens also executed two side letters.
Forbes Screens Guarantee
 The first side letter executed by Forbes Screens (the "Forbes Screens Guarantee", also referred to in the proceedings as the "1st Lot 9 Side Letter") was addressed to Forbes Asia.
The letter referred to the share sale agreement and the lease of Lot 9, and continued as follows: 
 1.
We hereby unequivocally and irrevocably admit and acknowledge that:- 

 
1.1 we are a company owned and controlled by Mark Forbes ("MF") and Karen Lee Forbes ("KF")
 
 
1.2 the Vendors are also companies owned and controlled by MF and KF and the Vendors are their nominee and it was inter alia, at our requests that you agreed to enter into the SS Agreement with the Vendors; and
 
 
1.3 in consideration thereof, as regards the Vendors' covenant under Clause 3.3 of the SS Agreement, we hereby agreed that in the event that the audited profit before tax of FEH shall fall short of the amount guaranteed by the Vendors thereunder, we, as Lessor under the lease shall agree to reduce the total rent ("Rent") payable by FEH during the twelve (12) months period immediately following the last day of that particular financial year of FEH where the amount of the audited profit before tax so guaranteed is not achieved.

 2.
In consideration of you entering into the SS Agreement with the Vendors inter alia at our requests, we hereby agree, covenant and undertake as follows:- 

 
2.1 If the audited profit before tax ("Pretax Profit YE/97") of FEH calculated in the manner as provided under the SS Agreement for the period 1.1.97 to 31.12.97 ("YE/97") shall not be more than A$1,300,000.00 ("P/Profit Target") then we hereby irrevocably and unequivocally discharge and release FEH of all obligations to pay to us such proportion of the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.98 to 31.12.98 ("YE/98") which is equivalent to the difference ("Profit Shortfall") between the said P/Profit Target for YE/97 and the said actual audited Pretax Profit YE/97.
If the Profit Shortfall exceeds 100% of such Rent, then we shall release and discharge FEH of FEH'S obligations and liabilities to pay to us the Rent for YE/98.
If the Profit Shortfall is less than such Rent, then FEH shall deduct such Profit Shortfall from the Rent for YE/98.
Such deductions shall be recovered by FEH by deductions of the same amount to the Rent payable by FEH to us under the Lease (for the YE/98).
2.2 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.99 to 31.12.99 ("YE/99"), the same formula set out in paragraph 2.1 above shall apply save and except the following differences:-
 
 
2.2.1 the Rent for YE/00 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease; and
 
 
2.2.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/98 shall be A$1,400,000.00.
2.3 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.2000 to 31.12.2000 ("YE/2000") the same formula set out in paragraph 2.1 above shall apply save and except the following differences:-
 
 
2.3.1 the Rent for YE/2000 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease;
 
 
2.3.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/99 shall be A$1,500,000.00.
Forbes Screens Lot 9 Lease Guarantee
 The second side letter executed by Forbes Screens ("Forbes Screens Lot 9 Lease Guarantee", also referred to in the proceedings as the "2nd Lot 9 Side Letter") addressed to Forbes Australia.
It referred to the lease of Lot 9 and continued: 
 In consideration of your agreeing to enter into the Lease with us at our requests, we hereby agree that we are obligated to you to effect the adjustments of Rent and/or the monthly instalments of the Rent as provided in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.3 of our above letter to Forbes Engineering (Asia) Pte Ltd and you are entitled to make such adjustments in your payment of rent to us.
In the event that under such adjustments we are required to refund to you such portion of the rent as have been paid by you to us, we shall pay to you on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.
If we shall have defaulted in such refund, without prejudice to your rights against us for our said default, we shall pay interest at the rate provided under Clause 6.8 of the Lease on such refund calculated from the date of our receipt of your demand until the date of actual payment of such refund.


 I have described the guarantees executed by Forbes Screens for completeness, because the existence of these agreements is pleaded by the applicants in paras 15, 16, 17 and 18 of amended statement of claim.
However the respondents plead that, as no relief is sought against Forbes Screens Pty Ltd, the matters pleaded in those paragraphs are irrelevant and embarrassing.
I consider that this pleading of the respondents has merit - indeed no relief is sought by the applicants against Forbes Screens Pty Ltd. New Directors
 After execution of the share sale agreement and the side letters on 22 September 1997, Forbes Asia appointed two new directors to Forbes Australia to serve on the board of Forbes Australia with Mr Forbes.
These directors, Mr Freddy Chan (appointed September 1997) and Mr Norman Lee (appointed July 1998) were associates of Mr Poh.
Variations to Share Sale Agreement
 The parties to the share sale agreement executed a number of deeds of variation to that agreement (according to undisputed evidence of Mr Poh --- five separate deeds: affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed 15 March 2006 para 11).
For the purposes of these proceedings the relevant deeds were the second, third and fourth deeds of variation.
The second deed of variation was executed on 12 January 1998 by Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia, Mr Forbes, Mrs Forbes and Forbes Screens.
The deed provided that it was effective to vary the share sale agreement as from 22 September 1997.
The second deed recited that Forbes Asia, Pearlbunch and Talrate had entered into the share sale agreement, that Mr Forbes, Mrs Forbes and Forbes Asia had entered into a "Letter of Indemnity" on 22 September 1997, and that Forbes Asia and Forbes Screens had entered into a "Letter of Indemnity" on 22 September 1997.
(It is clear that the "Letters of Indemnity" to which the deed refers are the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Screens Guarantee respectively.
) The deed recited further that an error had been discovered in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and cll 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the Letters of Indemnity (Forbes Guarantee and Forbes Screens Guarantee).
The deed continued: 
 It is agreed effective 22 September 1997 that:- 

 
1.1 Clause 3.3 of the Share Sale Agreement is deleted and replaced by the following:-
 
 
"3.3 The Vendors shall guarantee, ensure and cause the Company to achieve at least 90% of the following audited profits before tax during the following financial years of the Company provided always that the audited said profit before tax is calculated by reference to the formula set out in Annexure 1 attached hereto:
 
 
3.3.1 for the first financial year ending 31 December 1997 A$1,300,000;
 
 
3.3.2 for the financial year ending 31 December 1998 A$1,400,000; and
 
 
3.3.3 for the financial year ending 31 December 1999 A$1,500,000
 
 
For the financial year ending 31 December 2000, the Vendor shall use its best endeavours to cause the Company to achieve 90% of an audited profit before tax of A$1,600,000.
"
 
 
1.2 Clause 3.1, 3.2.2 and 3.3.2 of each of the Letters of Indemnity are deleted and replaced by the following:
 
 
"3.1 If the audited profit before tax (Pretax Profit YE/97) of FEH calculated in the manner as provided under SS Agreement for the period of 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997 (YE/97) shall not be more than 90% of $1,300,000 (P/Profit Target) then we hereby irrevocably and unequivocally discharge and release FEH of all obligations to pay to such proportion of the rent payable to FEH to us for the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1998 (YE/98) which is equivalent to the difference (Profit Shortfall) between the said P/Profit Target for YE/97 and the said actual audited Pretax Profit YE/97.
If the Profit Shortfall exceeds 100% of such rent, then we shall release and discharge FEH of FEH's obligations and liabilities to pay us the rent for YE/98.
If the Profit Shortfall is less than such rent, then FEH shall deduct such Profit Shortfall from the rent for YE/98.
Such deductions shall be recovered by FEH by deductions on the same amount to the rent payable to FEH to us under the lease (for the YE/98).
"
 
 
"3.2.2 The P/Profit Target for YE/98 shall be 90% of A$1,400,000.
"
 
 
"3.3.2 The P/Profit Target for YE/99 shall be 90% of A$1,500,000.
"
 
 The third deed of variation was executed by Pearlbunch, Talrate and Forbes Asia on 16 February 1998.
So far as relevant, cl 2.2 of the third deed amended cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement in the following terms: 
2.3 On or before the date of expiry of a period of 182 days from the date hereof and subject to Clause 2.7 below and the Purchaser having received all the documents referred to in Clause 2.4 below, the Purchaser shall pay into the FEH Accounts a further and last capital injection of $A1,099,999.00 ("3rd Injection") by way of $$599,999.00 cash and the balance by way of 1,800,000 ordinary shares ("Teamsphere Shares") issued by Teamsphere Ltd (Co. No 199705215 G) a public company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and having its registered office at 1 Changi South Street 1, Changi South Industrial Estate, Singapore 486797 together with the prescribed Transfer Forms duly signed by the registered owner of the Teamsphere Shares, as the transferor thereof PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT the provisions in Clause 2.2 above shall have been complied with and the Purchaser is satisfied that the 3rd Injection shall be applied by the Company (and the parties shall ensure the company shall do so) in the following manner:-
 
 
2.3.1 firstly, to pay on behalf of the Vendors, such part of the Said Dividend (which are payable by the Company to the Vendors and the Vendors hereby irrevocably authorise such payment), amounting to A$500,000.00 by way of the delivery of all the Teamsphere Shares (together with the aforesaid signed Transfer Form) with the Vendors' Solicitors namely Cleary Hoare Solicitors of 1st Floor, 145 Eagle Street Brisbane (hereinafter called "the Vendors' Solicitors) which said Teamsphere Shares shall hereinafter collectively be referred to as "the Retention Sum".
The Retention Sum shall not be released or drawn upon without the written consent of the Purchaser, unless in pursuant to the terms set out in Clause 3.4 below and the BPP shall have been paid by the Purchaser to the Vendors on the Completion Date (as hereinafter defined) in pursuant to Clause 2.4 or pursuant to Clause 5.1 or 5.2.
For the purpose of Clause 5.1 and 5.2, the Teamsphere Shares shall be treated as if each of them is cash of equivalent of the greater of:-
 
 
1. their market value; or
 
 
2.
A$0.2778
 
 
2.3.2 secondly, payment to the Vendors such part of the Said Dividend declared and shall have been due and payable to the Vendors by way of cheque for the sum of A$371,000.00 drawn in favour of FEH subject to the Purchaser having received the following:-
 
2.3.2.1 a letter by the Vendors to the Purchaser authorising the payment of the said A$371,000.00 on behalf of the Vendort to Hevenfleet Pty Ltd as trustee for the Forbes Family Trust ("FFT") directly;
 
 
2.3.2.2 a letter by FFT to the Purchaser to pay the same A$371,000.00 (due to FFT pursuant to Clause 2.3.2.1) directly to FI; and
 
 
2.3.2.3 a letter by FI to the Purchaser to pay the same A$371,000.00 (due to FI pursuant to Clause 2.3.2.2) directly to FEH;
 
 
2.3.3 thirdly, payment to the Vendors of a sum of A$228,999.00 as full and final payment by FEH to the Vendors of the Said Dividends; and
 
 
2.3.4 fourthly, to pay on behalf of FIA, a sum of A$1.00 to FI towards full and final settlement of the net total purchase price of A$1,300,000.00 under the SB Agreement.
The fourth deed of variation executed by Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia and Mr Poh on 23 March 1998 acknowledged the earlier variations of the share sale agreement.
So far as is relevant, the parties in this deed of variation varied the share sale agreement to enable the provision of 1,800,000 ordinary shares in Teamsphere Ltd referred to in cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement to be satisfied by the transfer of 180,000 shares in Teamsphere Ltd. Acquisition of Favco
 In October 1998 an opportunity arose for Forbes Australia to acquire the business of Hood Favco Pty Ltd ("Favco"), a Sydney-based business operating in the same field as Forbes Australia.
Correspondence took place between Mr Forbes and Mr Poh in relation to, inter alia , the terms upon which the acquisition of Favco was to take place.
Liquidity Problems
 It appears that subsequent to the acquisition of Favco, Forbes Australia experienced liquidity problems.
Indeed there is some evidence before the Court that at one point Forbes Australia was subject to voluntary administration under Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act (affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed 18 December 2006 para 4).
Demand
 On 6 April 2001 the applicants demanded the respondents pay to Forbes Australia the amounts of $127,284 and $1,691,284.
These sums represented profit shortfalls alleged by the applicants to have been experienced by Forbes Australia in the years ending 31 December 1998 and 31 December 1999 respectively.
The applicants' demands were made pursuant to the profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and as stated in the letter of demand "the relevant side letters".
CLAIMS OF THE APPLICANT 
 As I observed at the commencement of this judgment, it appears that the applicants have abandoned claims against Mr Forbes in respect of breach of director's duties.
The remaining claims of the applicants as found in the amended statement of claim are: Forbes Asia therefore claimed the following relief: 
(a) a declaration that Forbes Asia is entitled to have the Forbes Guarantee specifically performed and carried into execution; and
 
(b) an order that the respondents specifically perform and carry into effect the Forbes Guarantee by paying Forbes Australia the amount of $1,818,568.00;
 
(c) alternatively, an indemnity pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee for loss and damage;
 
(d) interest pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth);
 
(e) costs; and
 
(f) such other orders as the Court thinks fit.
Forbes Australia claimed the following relief: 
(a) damages in the amount of $1,818,568.00;
 
(b) alternatively, damages in the amount of $265,974.16 for breach of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee;
 
(c) interest pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth);
 
(d) alternatively interest from 12 April 2001 pursuant to the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee;
 
(e) costs; and
 
(f) such other orders as the Court thinks fit.
DEFENCE 
 The respondents filed a third further amended defence on 13 February 2008.
The respondents conceded that cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement was in the nature of a guarantee of performance by the vendors.
Notwithstanding this concession, in substance the respondents plead as follows: The share sale agreement did not permit any calculation, ascertainment or proof of the audited profit before tax of Forbes Australia by: the mere fact of preparation of a document or documents (including documents styled as audited financial statements) in purported conformity with cl 3.3; or the presentation or delivery of such document or documents; 
by Forbes Asia to any person who might be liable in respect of the guarantee under cl 3.3 (para 4B(ba)(i)).
The share sale agreement upon its proper construction permitted the parties who were potentially liable in respect of the guarantee under cl 3.3 to undertake their own assessment, and challenge any assertion as to, inter alia , the profit earned by Forbes Australia in each of the 1997, 1998, and 1999 calendar years (para 4B (ba)(ii)).
The guarantee under cl 3.3 was, upon its proper construction, premised on the continuation of certain matters set out in cl 3.1 of the share sale agreement, namely that the vendors were and remained entitled to control the make up of the board of Forbes Australia.
This did not occur --- instead Forbes Asia controlled the make-up of the board of Forbes Australia and appointed new directors as and when it saw fit.
Accordingly, the guarantee under cl 3.3 was discharged (para 4B(c)).
Alternatively, prior to the formation of the share sale agreement, Mr Forbes provided profit forecasts to Forbes Asia in respect of Forbes Australia's business as it then was, namely based entirely in Brisbane.
Forbes Asia knew that the profit forecasts were based upon Forbes Australia's Brisbane-based business as it then was.
The profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement were based on the Brisbane-based business of Forbes Australia.
In 1999 Forbes Australia's business was altered significantly and substantially by the acquisition of Favco.
The acquisition of Favco rendered the profit forecasts originally provided by Mr Forbes inapplicable to Forbes Australia's business after the acquisition.
Accordingly, the acquisition of Favco was a fundamental alteration to the transaction guaranteed by the respondents and discharged the respondents from any liability under the profit guarantees (para 4B(d)).
The respondents deny that they incurred any liability under the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee; alternatively that there was no valid consideration for it and accordingly it was void (para 4D).
While the respondents admit the existence of the deeds of variation to the share sale agreement: the third deed of variation replaced the existing cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement with an entirely new and materially different clause.
Neither of the respondents agreed to extend any existing guarantee or indemnity provided by them to Forbes Asia.
The Forbes Guarantee was discharged by the third deed of variation or alternatively was unenforceable (para 4F(d)); alternatively, the fourth deed of variation substantially amended cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement which meant that the Forbes Guarantee was discharged or alternatively was unenforceable (para 4F(e)).
In defence of the entire claim the respondents say that the applicants' cause of action arose more than six years prior to the commencement of the claim and is thereby statute barred (para 12 --- see also TS p 16 and p 17).
Alternatively, the respondents say that Forbes Asia is estopped from relying on the profit guarantees in circumstances where: on or about 15 or 16 September 1997, prior to the execution of the share sale agreement and the side letters in respect of Lot 8 and Lot 9, Mr Poh on behalf of Forbes Asia said to Mr Forbes that the profit guarantees would never be enforced by Forbes Asia and were just matters necessary to be included to satisfy the demands of its parent company Teamsphere Ltd; in reliance on this representation Mr Forbes executed the documents; subsequent to the execution of the documents, Mr Poh on behalf of Forbes Asia has repeated to the respondents that it would not enforce the Profit Guarantee thereby maintaining the representation.
ISSUES FOR DECISION 
 It is important as a threshold point to note that Pearlbunch, Talrate and Forbes Screens are not parties to these proceedings.
The proceedings do not involve an attempt by Forbes Asia to enforce the terms of the share sale agreement against the vendors of shares in Forbes Australia, nor do the applicants seek any relief from Forbes Screens.
Accordingly, relief sought by the applicants in the amended application for damages for breach of the share sale agreement is without foundation, because the vendors of the shares who were parties to the share sale agreement are not named as respondents to this litigation.
The key issues in these proceedings relate to the enforceability or otherwise of guarantees given by Mr and Mrs Forbes in terms of the profit guarantees in the share sale agreement.
Mr and Mrs Forbes were parties to the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.
In my view, the following issues require decision.
Did Forbes Australia experience a profit shortfall in the financial year ending 31 December 1998?
What is the position of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall?
Was the effect of cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement such that the production of audited figures for the financial year ending 31 December 1999 was conclusive evidence of those figures, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Dobbs v National Bank of Australasia Ltd [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643?
Was the change of control of Forbes Australia from the vendors to Forbes Asia an alteration in the factual substratum sufficient to discharge the respondents as guarantors?
Did the third and fourth deeds of variation to the share sale agreement result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors?
Did the transaction resulting in the acquisition of Favco by Forbes Australia result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors under the Forbes Guarantee?
Even if the vendors' profit guarantees as articulated in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement are valid, are the applicants estopped from relying on them because of the alleged representations of Mr Poh as pleaded in para 13 of the respondents' defence?
Was the applicants' cause of action statute barred?
Was the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee enforceable?
What are appropriate rulings in relation to the notice of motion filed 12 September 2007?
I now turn to each of these issues.
1.
Did Forbes Australia experience a profit shortfall in the financial year ending 31 December 1998?
So far as concerns the 1998 financial year the applicants submit in their Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions as follows: The respondents submitted in summary: Mr Forbes agreed with Mr Poh that the agreed profit shortfall for the 1998 calendar year was $127,284 but the agreement was founded upon a misapprehension on the part of Mr Forbes that there had been a proper accounting of all of Forbes Australia's sales for the 1998 calendar year.
Forbes Australia had failed to record approximately $241,000 in sales, which sales had occurred in 1998 rather than 1997.
Although invoices were issued in November and December 1997, Forbes Asia asked for invoices to be re-issued to suit Forbes Asia, and therefore new invoices were issued in respect of the same goods in February 1998.
Forbes Asia, by its request for the issuing of credit notes in respect of those sales, knew that the sales had occurred in 1998.
Had those sales been taken up on Forbes Australia's accounts for the 1998 calendar year, there would have been no profit shortfall that year.
The respondents submit that those sales should have been recorded in Forbes Australia's 1998 calendar year accounts.
Notwithstanding statements of Mr Brauer and Mr Poh in relation to the accruals accounting basis of Forbes Australia: there is no evidence as to whether Forbes Asia treated the sales as having occurred in 1997 or 1998; the re-issued invoices state that title to the goods does not pass until payment for the goods is received (affidavit of Terrence Brauer filed 18 January 2008 exhibit "TB 5" invoices 23295 and 232396); Mr Lytras' evidence, which was not tested or challenged, its that on the face of the relevant invoice documents it is not possible to tell without access to Forbes Australia's books and records whether the sales should properly be attributed to the 1997 or 1998 calendar years (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 11 February 2008 para 4 and para 5).
Accordingly, it would be unconscionable to permit the applicants to enforce the agreement formed on 14 January 1999.
In any event, the agreement formed on 14 January 1999 did not involve, and was not binding upon, Mrs Forbes.
Further and alternatively, it is an abuse of process to permit the applicants to enforce the agreement of 14 January 1999 because Forbes Australia has failed to maintain its financial records, meaning that the respondents cannot reasonably and properly identify Forbes Australia's correct sales for the 1998 calendar year.
Consideration
 For the moment placing to one side the issue of whether the basis on which the agreement was reached was flawed --- it is clear from the evidence before the Court that an agreement was reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes at a meeting held on or about 14 January 1999.
The agreement was to the effect that Forbes Australia had suffered a profit shortfall of $127,284 for the financial year ending 31 December 1998.
It appears that this profit shortfall was calculated by Mr Brauer, the accountant for Forbes Australia, and Mr Kang Ching Hong, the internal auditor for Teamsphere Ltd, and accepted by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes.
It also appears that at that meeting the parties discussed the method by which the profit shortfall would be remedied by Mr Forbes.
Subsequently Forbes Australia recorded the sum of $127,294 as a prepayment of rent payable under the Lot 8 lease in the books of account of Forbes Australia.
A clear inference may be drawn that this action was in accordance with both the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee which as already noted provided respectively that Mr and Mrs Forbes guaranteed certain profits and that any profit shortfall would be met by way of waiving lease payments.
The fact that the oral agreement between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes did not result in a written amendment to the Forbes Guarantee does in my view detract from the validity of the agreement with respect to the 1998 profit shortfall so far as concerns Mr Forbes, where the agreement was implemented by reference to journal entries in the accounts of Forbes Australia (cf Koenigsblatt v Sweet [1923] 2 Ch 314).
Notwithstanding the agreement reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes however, it also appears clear that despite the relevant journal entry Forbes Australia continued to pay Mr Forbes rent in respect of the Lot 8 lease (TS p 302 ll 9-11).
Subsequently a journal entry reversing the prepayment was entered in Forbes Australia's general ledger on 30 June 1999.
The fact that this event occurred does not appear to be in doubt (for example evidence that it occurred was given by Mr Brauer in his affidavit sworn 25 January 2006 para 28).
Prima facie on these facts, it follows that if the 1998 profit shortfall agreed by the parties on 14 January 1999 is enforceable, not only is that amount ($127,284) outstanding from the respondents, but because Forbes Australia continued to pay rent of Lot 8 and Lot 9 and any purported prepayment of rent was reversed in the accounts, the applicants have substantiated their claims that: However despite the agreement of 14 January 1999, the respondents contend that it should not be enforced.
Three relevant issues arise.
The first issue is whether any finding as to a profit shortfall or otherwise can be made in the absence of the books and records of Forbes Australia for 1998, which books and records are no longer available.
The second issue concerns the claim by the respondents that in fact the agreement of Mr Poh and Mr Forbes was based on a false assumption as to the value of sales which took place in 1997, but which in fact should have been accounted as having taken place in 1998.
The third issue concerns the position of Mrs Forbes, which I will consider later in the judgment.
Absence of source financial documentation
 The history of these proceedings reflects the steps taken by the respondents to obtain source financial documentation of Forbes Australia.
It became clear prior to the trial of the substantive proceedings that the second applicant simply had not retained source financial documentation relating to its affairs in the 1998 and 1999 calendar years.
Further, it appears that notwithstanding an order of this Court for third party discovery, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (which conducted an audit of the accounts of Forbes Australia for the calendar year ending 31 December 1999) did not have this documentation.
I accept the submissions by the applicants that the respondents had not asked for source financial documentation until October 2006, which is after the seven year retention period in relation to the documents had elapsed.
There is no suggestion that source documentation had been deliberately destroyed.
In my view no adverse inferences can be drawn in relation to the absence of the relevant source financial documentation.
The courts have recognised the importance of access to source financial documentation in the face of conflicting financial evidence (for example, Hamilhall Pty Ltd v AT Phillips Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1446 ; (1994) 54 FCR 173 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey [2006] QSC 297).
However the fact that source financial documentation is not available does not mean that the Court is unable to make a determination on a question of financial position (for example, David Towney v Minister for Land  Water Conservation for NSW [1997] FCA 656 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey [2006] QSC 297).
In this case, notwithstanding that the books and records of Forbes Australia from the 1998 financial year are not available, the evidence is clear that Mr Poh and Mr Forbes, assisted by informed accounting advisors, agreed on 14 January 1999 that on available figures the profit shortfall for 1998 would be $127,284.
I do not consider that the absence in these proceedings of the source financial documents of Forbes Australia from 1998 undermines the existence of that agreement or in any way gives rise to an abuse of process with respect to this aspect of the claim (an issue to which I will return later in the judgment).
As to the lack of an audit for that period, I note that Mr Poh deposed in his affidavit affirmed 5 January 2008 as follows: 
 28.
I refer to paragraphs 5 to 9 of my First Affidavit affirmed on 25 October 2005.
Following what Mr Forbes had said during that meeting, I understood that there had been agreement between Mr Forbes and myself that the amount of the 1998 profit shortfall was $127,284 for the purposes of the Profit Guarantee.
I expected that the shortfall would be made up by Mr Forbes in the manner described.
Consequently, I did not arrange for Forbes Australia to have its accounts audited by the company auditor (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) for the year ended 31 December 1998.
Because I understood that there was an agreement as to the amount of the 1998 profit shortfall and expected it to be honoured, I considered the cost of an audit to be unnecessary.


 In my view this evidence is consistent with the fact that Mr Poh and Mr Forbes agreed as to the profit shortfall of Forbes Australia for 1998, leaving an audit unnecessary.
Were Forbes Australia's sales for 1998 actually understated by $240,866.42?
Of greater concern is the possibility that information which came to the parties' attention after 1998 demonstrated that in fact the agreement of 14 January 1999 was based on inaccurate data.
Mr Forbes in his affidavits deposes as to this belief --- in particular in paras 29-32 of his affidavit of 18 January 2008 wherein he deposes as follows: 
 29.
I refer to paragraph 34 of Kiat's 2nd Affidavit.
In paragraph 35 of my First Affidavit, I say that I verily believe that the profit figure for the year ended 31 December 1998 exceeded the Profit Guarantee figure of $1.4 million by $151,156.00.
My belief was based on calculations made by Forbes Australia's staff that were provided to my (sic) early in 2000.
The calculations were given to me in the form of a handwritten note, a true copy of which is Exhibit "MF-9" to this Affidavit.
My recollection is that at or shortly after the time I received this note I referred them to Terry Brauer.


 
 30.
I have since been informed by Terry Brauer that he no longer holds the view that the 1998 sales were understated by the sum of $418,000.00 and that the credit notes issued by Forbes Australia at the direction of the First Applicant all appear valid to the extent that the sales recorded in the invoices to which the credit notes relate are recorded elsewhere.


 
 31.
I have since reviewed the relevant invoices and credit notes myself and say that: 

 
 (a) the sales recorded in invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 (both dated 29 January 1998) are the same as those recorded in invoices numbered 23217 to 23224 (all dated 20 November 1997) and 23451 and 23452 (both dated 8 December 1997); 

 
 (b) the credit notes issued in 1998 in respect of invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 should have been issued in respect of invoices numbered 23217 to 23224 inclusive and invoices numbered 23451 and 23452, because the sales were not actually made until 1998 as indicated in invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 (both dated 29 January 1998).


 
 32.
In the circumstances, Forbes Australia's profit for the 1998 calendar year was understated by $240,866.42 (not $418,000.00 as I indicated in my First Affidavit) when account is taken of the fact that credit notes were issued, at the request of the First Applicant, in respect of sales that actually took place in 1998 rather than the end of 1997.


 Mr Forbes' evidence was supported by evidence of Mr Brauer who deposed that the understated profit for the 1998 was the result of the sale of various concrete mixers by Forbes Australia to the Asian subsidiaries of Teamsphere Ltd, and that following an examination of Forbes Australia's accounts he discovered that these sales had been reversed and were not treated as income in the accounts of Forbes Australia (affidavit of Terrence Brauer affirmed 25 January 2006 para 32 and para 33).
Indeed Mr Forbes in his affidavit deposed that sales in 1998 had been understated by $240,866.42, which is the sum total of the sales referred to in Invoices 21701 and 23702.
Invoice 23702 refers to the same mixer serial numbers as those supplied pursuant to Invoice 23701, however Invoice 23702 is an invoice for the labour to assemble those mixers.
These invoices are exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Brauer sworn 18 January 2008.
However it became clear during cross-examination of Mr Forbes and Mr Brauer that the sales which the respondents claimed should have been credited to the 1998 year actually took place in 1997, and were properly accounted as 1997 sales, as claimed by the applicants.
In fact, the sales which took place in 1997 were, as the applicants claimed, simply reinvoiced in 1998.
I note in particular Counsel's cross-examination of Mr Forbes (TS p 284 et seq) with respect to Invoice 21701, (dated 20 February 1998) which Invoice referred to the supply of ten hydraulic mixers and the serial numbers of mixers, and which on the face of the invoice totalled $140,000.
As Mr Jones' cross-examination demonstrated, Invoice 23701, dated 20 February 1998, merely reflected sales that were invoiced and shipped in 1997.
Further, I note that Mr Brauer conceded during cross-examination that the sales referred to in Invoice 23701 actually took place in 1997 (TS p 327 ll 21-24).
Mr Poh deposed that the two invoices 23701 and 23702 were not actual sales but repeat billings for the sales made in November and December 1997, and the Credit Notes 485 and 549 exhibited on pp 36 and 37 of exhibit TB5 to Mr Brauer's affidavit sworn 18 January 2006 were correctly issued to reverse those repeat billings.
In my view this evidence correctly represents the position with respect to the sales referred to in those invoices.
I note further that the expert evidence in relation to the existence (or otherwise) of a Forbes Australia profit shortfall for 1998 is conflicting and of marginal assistance.
Expert evidence tendered by both parties was qualified by the absence of audited financial statements for 1998.
The expert report prepared by Mr Blackwood for the applicants and dated 18 September 2006 calculated a profit shortfall for the year ended 31 December 1998 as either $195,397 or $171,096, depending on a number of variables.
Mr Lytras in giving expert evidence for the respondents deposed that from the information available and given the multiple invoices, it was not possible for him to definitively determine the calendar year in which the sales of hydraulic mixers the subject of invoices 23701 and 23702 took place (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 11 February 2008).
However I consider that Mr Lytras' evidence in relation to this issue is of little value in light of the concessions made by both Mr Forbes and Mr Brauer during cross-examination.
On this basis, contrary to evidence of Mr Forbes and affidavit evidence of Mr Brauer, I do not accept that that the profits of Forbes Australia were understated by $240,886.42 in 1998, or that the agreement of Mr Poh and Mr Forbes on 14 January 1999 as to the profit shortfall experienced by Forbes Australia in 1998 was based on inaccurate data.
Conclusion
 The law is clear that contractual provisions in a guarantee are to be construed strictly, and, in relation to provisions for the benefit of the principal, contra proferentum : Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Aust) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 561; Apple Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Mekrizis [2003] NSWSC 126 at [127] .
In relation to the 1998 profit shortfall however, it is clear that the fact and amount of a profit shortfall for 1998 were agreed, on an informed basis, by Mr Poh on behalf of both applicants and Mr Forbes.
Failing other reasons which have been advanced by the respondents, and to which I shall turn shortly, in my view the amount of $127,284 represents the profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1998 for the purposes of cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and is recoverable from Mr Forbes by the applicants pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee.
2.
What is the position of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall?
Notwithstanding any findings by the Court in relation to the position of Mr Forbes, the respondents deny that Mrs Forbes is bound to the agreed 1998 profit shortfall amount of $127,284 on the basis that she was not present during discussions about this issue.
The respondents claim further that Mrs Forbes cannot be bound by any agreement of Mr Forbes to the 1998 profit shortfall amount because Mr Forbes had no authority to act on behalf of Mrs Forbes.
This is because: Specifically, the respondents point to Mr Poh's evidence as deposed in para 8 of his affidavit affirmed 25 October 2005 which is as follows: 
 I recall having a conversation at the meeting with Mr Forbes to the following effect: 

 
 Poh Kiat: "Do you accept the figures by the accountants?
" 

 
 Mark Forbes: "Yes.
" 

 
 Mr Forbes did not deny any responsibility for paying the 1998 profit shortfall.


 
 Poh Kiat: "When are you going to pay the shortfall?
" 

 
 Mark Forbes: "I don't have the cash available to pay the debt at this time.
" 

 
 Poh Kiat: "Forbes Australia could raise a pre-payment of rent in its financial accounts in relation to Forbes Australia's leases of its Brisbane premises [leased from Mark Forbes, Karen Forbes (the Second Respondent) and Forbes Screens Pty Ltd].
The pre-payment of rent could be used to pay Forbes Australia's rent on the leases of Lots 8 and 9 for the next seven months.
" 

 
 Mark Forbes: "I can't accept your proposal because I have separated from my wife [Karen Forbes] and do not know what property settlement will be made.
" 

 
 Poh Kiat: "I will accept a repayment schedule from you setting out how the pre-payment of rent will be applied against rent as it becomes due.
" 

 
 By this arrangement I meant that only a portion of the rent falling due each month would be paid by application of the pre-payment of rent.


 
 Mark Forbes: "I accept that arrangement.
But if Forbes Australia achieves a profit over and above the 1999 profit target, I will use my entitlement of 10% of that profit to pay the 1998 shortfall.
" 

 
 Poh Kiat: "I accept your proposal.
" 

 Further, the respondents point to evidence of Mr Poh in his affidavit affirmed 5 February 2008 where Mr Poh deposed at para 28: 
 I expected that the shortfall would be made up by Mr Forbes in the manner described.


 The respondents submit that the effect of any such agreements between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes was that any obligation of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 calendar year was replaced by an obligation upon Mr Forbes' alone to pay, by some form of gradual repayment over time, the sum of $127,284.
The applicants submit that Mrs Forbes had allowed Mr Forbes to carry out all of the dealings in respect of these transactions, including the contractual negotiations, and in those circumstances she clothed him with ostensible authority to reach the agreed 1998 profit shortfall on her behalf.
Consideration
 In my view the submissions of the respondents concerning the liability of Mrs Forbes for the agreed 1998 profit shortfall have merit.
The Forbes Guarantee specifically referred to the profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and the formula in Annexure 1 to that agreement, both of which in turn referred to the machinery for calculating audited profits before tax.
The agreement reached between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes as to the 1998 profit shortfall, clearly in substitution of the machinery of calculation provided in the share sale agreement, was a material alteration to the terms of the Forbes Guarantee with respect to the 1998 year.
Mr Poh has submitted that it is binding, and, as I have already found, it is binding on Mr Forbes.
The position is, however, different with respect to Mrs Forbes.
It is not in dispute that Mrs Forbes was not present at the meeting of 14 January 1999 when the agreement as to the 1998 profit shortfall was reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes.
Indeed in this case there is no evidence of any contact between either applicant and Mrs Forbes in relation to the agreed 1998 profit shortfall (or any other matter), and certainly no actual agreement.
Principles of actual and ostensible authority in agency law are well-known.
A succinct explanation was given by Diplock LJ in Freeman  Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 at 502: 
 An "actual" authority is a legal relationship between principal and agent created by a consensual agreement to which they alone are parties.
Its scope is to be ascertained by applying ordinary principles of construction of contracts, including any proper implications from the express words used, the usages of trade, or the course of business between the parties ... 

 
 An "apparent" or "ostensible" authority, on the other hand, is a legal relationship between the principal and the contractor created by a representation, made by the principal to the contractor, intended to be and in fact acted upon by the contractor, that the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind within the scope of the "apparent" authority, so as to render the principal liable to perform any obligations imposed upon him by such a contract.
To the relationship so created the agent is a stranger.
He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as principal himself.
The representation, when acted upon by the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent, operates as an estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is not bound by the contract.
It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to enter into the contract.


 
 We have already indicated that actual authority may be implied.
It is, however, important to emphasise that the authority impliedly granted by the principal to the agent must be such as could be validly granted by express agreement.


 These principles represent the law in Australia ( Crabtree-Vickers Pty Ltd v Australian Direct Mail Advertising  Addressing Co Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 49 ; (1975) 133 CLR 72 , Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General [1990] HCA 32 ; (1990) 170 CLR 146 , Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; [2004] 218 CLR 451).
The applicants submit that Mrs Forbes had clothed Mr Forbes with authority to conclude such an agreement on her behalf.
However the only evidence before the Court relevant to Mrs Forbes in the context of the meeting of 14 January 1999 and the agreement there reached is that the applicants were aware that Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes had separated.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary (of which there is none before me) such circumstances run counter to any claimed representation that Mr Forbes had authority to bind Mrs Forbes to an agreement with the applicants in any respect.
Further, I agree with the respondents that the agreement concluded between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall was couched only in terms of Mr Forbes' obligations.
It is settled law that a surety will be discharged from his or her obligations where there is a fundamental alteration to the guaranteed obligations to which the surety has not consented: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 , Wallace-Smith v Thiess Infraco (Swanston) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 49 at [302] .
As the majority said in Ankar (1987) 162 CLR 546 after discussing a number of English cases: 
 These statements of principle ... indicate that the principle is the by-product, not so much of the general law of contract, as of the special relationship between creditor and surety arising out of the suretyship contract upon which equity fastened to protect the surety when the creditor's conduct affected the surety's liability: Holme v Brunskill .
According to the English cases, the principle applies so as to discharge the surety when conduct on the part of the creditor has the effect of altering the surety's rights, unless the alteration is unsubstantial and not prejudicial to the surety.
The rule does not permit the courts to inquire into the effect of the alteration.
The consequence is that, to hold the surety to its bargain, the creditor must show that the nature of the alteration can be beneficial to the surety only or that by its nature it cannot in any circumstances increase the surety's risk, e.g.
a reduction in the debtor's debt or in the interest payable by the surety.
The mere possibility of detriment is enough to bring about the discharge of the surety.
(at 559-560) 

 In Holme v Brunskill [1877] 3 QBD 495 Cotton LJ (Thesiger LJ concurring) said: 
 The true rule in my opinion is, that if there is any agreement between the principals with reference to the contract guaranteed, the surety ought to be consulted, and that if he has not consented to the alteration, although in cases where it is without inquiry evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or that it cannot be otherwise than beneficial to the surety, the surety may not be discharged; yet, that if it is not self-evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or one which cannot be prejudicial to the surety, the Court, will not, in an action against the surety, go into an inquiry as to the effect of the alteration, or allow the question, whether the surety is discharged or not, to be determined by the finding of a jury as to the materiality of the alteration or on the question whether it is to the prejudice of the surety, but will hold that in such a case the surety himself must be the sole judge whether or not he will consent to remain liable notwithstanding the alteration, and that if he has not so consented he will be discharged.
(at 505-506) 

 In my view Mrs Forbes is not bound by the agreement reached by Mr Poh on behalf of the applicants and Mr Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall.
Further, the substituted agreement with respect to the 1998 profit shortfall represented a material alteration to the calculation of that shortfall, the terms of the principal agreement and in particular the liability of the guarantors with respect to the amount guaranteed for the year ending 31 December 1998.
It is not claimed, and there is no evidence, that this alteration in any way benefited Mrs Forbes.
Accordingly, any liability of Mrs Forbes in relation to a profit shortfall for the calendar year ending 31 December 1998 pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee and cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement was discharged in light of the substituted agreement reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes in respect of that year, and to which she has not consented.
3.
Was the effect of clause 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement such that the production of audited figures for the 1999 financial year was conclusive evidence of those figures, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Dobbs v National Bank of Australasia Ltd [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643?
In relation to the year ending 31 December 1999 the applicants submit that Forbes Australia recorded an audited loss before tax, calculated by reference to the Formula in Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement, of $341,284.00.
This loss, recorded in Forbes Australia's audited financial report for that year prepared by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, together with the failure of Forbes Australia to reach the guaranteed profit of $1,350,000 (being 90% of $1,500,000 in accordance with cl 3.3.3 of the share sale agreement as varied) resulted in Forbes Australia experiencing a profit shortfall for that year of $1,691,284.
The applicants submit further that the fact that the loss was recorded following an audit in accordance with Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement means that it is conclusive evidence of that loss.
The applicants refer to the decision of the High Court in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 as authority for this proposition.
The applicants' case in relation to the claimed 1999 shortfall was helpfully summarised by Counsel in closing submissions, as follows: 
 Mr Jones: Your Honour, the applicant's case is very straight forward, and that is the terms of the share sale agreement, clause 3.3 says that the profit guarantee --- the amounts of the profit guarantee are to be referenced by the audited accounts.
Now, in evidence is the only document which fits within that description.
It's the audit by Deloittes, the company auditors.
They are the audited accounts.
If they are not audited accounts, and if they are not audited accounts to which that clause refers, then, one may ask rhetorically what conceivably could possibly fit that description of audited accounts.
There's no suggestion, there's no pleading that that audit report, those accounts are in any way were fraudulently prepared or are not what they say they are...
There's much complaint raised that, "Oh, we can't test it.
" That's true to a point, insofar as that every single document which those auditors would have seen are no longer available, and there's the evidence, particularly, that the correspondence between the instructing solicitors explain why that is, and, namely, that the company went into a period of administration for a period of time, and lost control of all of its records, and when it came out of administration it never got those --- all of those records back.
And for some reason the accountants --- the administrators no longer have them, and unfortunately Deloittes no longer have everything either.
Now, but it's... And it's a novel proposition put by the respondent that the plaintiff, in particular a company can't rely on its own audited accounts, which is what we're seeking to do.
Now, if your Honour accepts that they are the audited accounts of the company for the period 31 December 1999, then, in our submission, that is the end of the story.
They fit the description of the accounts referred to in the profit guarantee clause, and clearly on their face, they comply with the terms in the share sale agreement.
My friend, in his submissions, put to your Honour that they don't, they merely --- there's a further step that needed to be done, and that hasn't been done, is the effect of my friend's submission.
If you Honour will turn to exhibit 1A, at page 148, which is at the end of the audit report --- Deloittes audit report.
There it is.


 
 There it is.
That's the calculation in accordance with clause 3.3 of the share sale agreement.
So the applicant has done all it can conceivably, in terms of establishing what the profit was or --- and rather the loss was, and what the profit shortfall was, in this case.
And you have the subsequent to that report is the report of Ernst and Young which merely confirms the position of the Deloittes calculation.
But your Honour need not, strictly speaking, rely on refer to it as the only report, because the Deloittes report is what it is, the audited reports of the company.
(TS pp 391-392) 

 The respondents' case with respect to the claimed loss in the 1999 calendar year falls into three parts --- namely an attack on the applicants' interpretation of cl 3.3 as a matter of law, submissions with respect to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report itself, and submissions as to the admissibility of the report.
In relation to the applicants' interpretation of cl 3.3, the respondents submit that the applicants' claims with respect to the final and conclusive nature of an audit report allegedly produced in compliance with cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement are unsustainable in light of ordinary principles of interpretation applicable to commercial contracts because: Further submissions of the respondents with respect to the authority of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report are in summary: The respondents submitted that, in light of these concerns with respect to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, it should be ruled inadmissible.
Consideration
 Is the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report like a "bankers certificate"?
It is not in contention that, following the resignation of Mr Forbes as chief executive officer of Forbes Australia, Mr Poh asked Mr Singh, the new chief executive officer of Forbes Australia, to ask Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to prepare audited financial statements for the 1999 financial year (TS p 215), and that Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu did so.
The applicants rely on that report as being final and conclusive evidence in relation to that aspect of their claim concerning the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1999.
