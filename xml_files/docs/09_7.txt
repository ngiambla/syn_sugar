 Background 
 
 1 On 30 May 2007 the applicant, Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited, lodged a Fringe benefits tax (FBT) return for the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 with the Australian Taxation Office.
2 Under s 72(c) -(e) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) ('the FBT Act'), the furnishing of that return had the following effect:
 '72.
... 
 
 
 (c) the Commissioner shall be deemed at that time to have made an assessment (in this section referred to as the deemed assessment ) of: 
 
 
 
(i) the fringe benefits taxable amount (including a nil amount) of the employer of the year of tax; and (ii) the amount (including a nil amount) of tax payable on that fringe benefits taxable amount; 
 
 
 being those respective amounts as specified in the return referred to in paragraph (a); 
 
 (d) the return referred to in paragraph (a) shall be deemed to be a notice of the deemed assessment and to be under the hand of the Commissioner; 
 
 (e) the notice referred to in paragraph (d) shall be deemed to have been served at that time on the person liable to pay the tax.
' 
 
 


 
3 The amount specified in the return as the 'Fringe benefits taxable amount' was $548,116 and the 'Amount of tax payable' on that Fringe benefits taxable amount was $254,873.94.
4 By an objection dated 4 October 2007 which was apparently lodged with the Australian Taxation Office on 5 October 2007 the applicant objected against the assessment of the fringe benefits taxable amount and the amount of tax payable thereon under the FBT Act, the relevant grounds being recorded as follows:
 '(a) the Assessment is excessive and should now be set aside or altered by: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) excising the amount of Fringe Benefits Tax ("FBT") assessed to the applicant; and 
 
 (ii) re-calculating the FBT payable for the relevant period, accordingly.

 
 
 
The taxpayer relies upon the following grounds (none of which are to be taken as limiting any of the grounds in support of this objection): 
 
 1.
The applicant taxpayer is not liable to make withholding payments in connection with salary and wages because the salary and wages paid by the applicant are exempt income under s.23AG of ITAA36.

 
 
 
 2.
No part of the said assessed amount was an amount which should have been included in the Fringe Benefits Taxable Amount of the taxpayer for the purposes of s.66 of the FBT Act because: 
 
 
 
 
 a) The applicant makes payments of salary and wages to its employees in connection with contracts of employment but the applicant is not an employer for the purposes of s.136(1) of the FBT Act because: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 b) The payments of salary or wages made by the applicant are not 'salary or wages' for the purposes of s.136(1) of the FBT Act because the payments are exempt income of the employees by operation of s.23AG of ITAA36, and accordingly, the payment of salary or wages are not payments from which the taxpayer is required to withhold amounts under the Pay-As-You-Go ('PAYG') withholding tax system in accordance with s.12-1 of Schedule 1 Part 2-5 of the TAA 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 c) Payments made by the applicant to its employees are exempt income by operation of s.23AG of ITAA36 insofar as the payments constitute remuneration in connection with contracts of employment which were performed by the applicant's employees who at all times in the relevant income year satisfied the requirement of a continuous period of not less than 91 days in foreign service for the purposes of ss.23AG(1), (6) and (6A).

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 d) In the alternative, any days the employees are not considered to be engaged in foreign service within the meaning of s.23AG of ITAA36 should constitute recreation leave or sick leave for the purposes of s.23AG(6), and therefore should fall within the extended meaning of 'engaged in foreign service'.
Accordingly, the requirement of 91 days continuous period of foreign service should still be satisfied.

 
 
 
 
 
 3.
Further and alternatively, and without in any way limiting any of the grounds in this objection, if the Commissioner purported to have formed any opinion or to be satisfied or to have failed to be satisfied as to any matter or to have exercised any discretion or power or to have failed to exercise any discretion or power under the FBT Act or the TAA as a basis of, or as justifying the Assessment, including any assessment of additional tax and of exercising any discretion to remit additional tax, then the Commissioner took into account an irrelevant consideration or considerations, and/or failed to take into account a relevant consideration or considerations and otherwise acted arbitrarily, capriciously and contrary to law.

 
 As the Notice contains insufficient particulars of the basis of the Assessment, the taxpayer reserves the right to raise before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a Court upon the hearing of any appeal arising here from further grounds or may, before such Tribunal or Court, make an application pursuant to s 14ZZK or s 14ZZO of the TAA, as the case may be, for leave to amend the grounds of this Notice of Objection.
' 

 
5 By a 'NOTICE OF DECISION ON OBJECTION' dated 12 March 2008 the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation disallowed the applicant's objection.
6 Thereupon, the applicant filed an Application on 7 May 2008 appealing to the Court against the relevant appealable objection decision, being the decision of the respondent made on 12 March 2008 to disallow in full the applicant's objection, said to have been dated 5 October 2007, against the Notice of Assessment issued by the respondent on 30 May 2007 of the applicant's Fringe Benefits Taxable Amount for the tax period ending 31 March 2007.
The relief sought in the Application was that the applicant's objection be allowed in full and the setting aside of the fringe benefits tax assessment.
7 The applicant, a company incorporated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited ('Cathay Pacific').
8 The applicant retains the services of air crew around the world who are made available to serve as air crew for Cathay Pacific under a service agreement between the applicant and Cathay Pacific.
Employment Contracts 
 
9 A typical employment contract between an individual aircrew member and the applicant took the form of a letter from the applicant to the potential aircrew member inviting acceptance by the potential aircrew member at the foot thereof and the insertion of the appropriate date, thereby creating the contractual relationship.
The form of the offer of employment was expressed to be subject to the 'Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited Conditions of Service (2002)', a copy of which was attached to the form of letter.
That document comprised some 90 odd pages.
In turn, it provided for it to be 'read in conjunction with the Operations Manual, Volume 1, as the same may be amended from time to time, subject to the provisions of Section 21' (Volume 1 of Cathay Pacific's Operations Manual comprised some 390 odd pages).
It also provided for the Conditions of Service to 'be interpreted in accordance with the law as set out in the various applicable Ordinances of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region'.
10 The form of letter offering employment was as follows:
 ' OVERSEAS AIRCREW BASING LIMITED A wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited 3/F, Central Tower Cathay Pacific City 8 Scenic Road Hong Kong International Airport Lantau Hong Kong Dear We are pleased to offer you employment with our company as a on the Airbus with effect from This offer is subject to the Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited Conditions of Service (2002) a copy of which is attached hereto.
This employment contract is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and the parties hereto shall submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong.
If you agree to accept the terms of our offer, kindly sign the duplicate of this letter and return the same to us.
Yours faithfully, For and on behalf of OVERSEAS AIRCREW BASING LIMITED Andrea Lucas Manager Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited Accepted: Date: ...' 

 
11 The determination of the 'Home Base' and/or 'Preferred Port' of an aircrew member would appear to be addressed in an 11 page 'Permanent Basings Policy Agreement 2006' or a 10 page 'Freighter Aircraft Basings Policy 2000', which form part of the 'Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited Conditions of Service (2002)' as amended.
12 The former agreement would appear to have been reached between the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers' Association on behalf of its members of the one part and Cathay Pacific, the applicant, New Zealand Basing Limited, USA Basing Limited and Veta Limited (collectively referred to as 'the company') of the other part.
13 Clause 16 of the Permanent Basings Policy Agreement 2006 provided as follows:
 '16.
ADMINISTRATION 16.1.
The Base Administrative Centres are: a. Sydney for the Australian and New Zealand Base Areas; b. London for the European Base Area; and c. Vancouver for the Canadian and USA Base Areas.

 
 
 These centres will handle specific duties for Based Officers as directed, and on behalf of, the Basing Company Headquarters in Hong Kong.

 
 
 
 16.2 Officers will be required to commence and finish a duty cycle at their HB [Home Base] and, if applicable, their PP [Preferred Port] .
Travel between the Officer's residence and HB or PP and any accommodation and expenses at the HB or PP are for the Officers' own account.

 
 
 
 16.3 Positioning from other than the Officer's HB or PP at the commencement or completion of a scheduled duty will be in accordance with Company Policy.

 
 
 
 16.4 Any personal taxation or personal social security liability resulting from an Officer's choice of residence will be for his/her own account.

 
 
 
 16.5 Based Officers will be responsible for ensuring that they comply with any immigration and/or visa requirements of the relevant authorities in the Officers choice of residence although the Company will render Officers reasonable assistance wherever possible.

 
 
 
 16.6 The Basing Companies will render reasonable assistance to an Officer taking up a base appointment in obtaining such professional advice as the Officer may require provided that the Company shall not incur any financial or other liability in so doing.

 
 
 
 16.7.
The Basing Company will satisfy all reporting and income tax withholding requirements on behalf of any of its employees who are subject to such requirements.

 
 
 
 16.8.
Protection given to Officers, in accordance with the "Responsibility of the Company" Section of the Conditions of Service, in the event of incident or accident, shall be no less than that provided by CPA [Cathay Pacific] .
' 
 


 
14 Clause 4 of the Permanent Basings Policy Agreement 2006 included the following definitions:
 '4.2 Base Area 
 
 A defined area within which the Home Base and/or Preferred Port is situated.
Current Base Areas are Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, New Zealand and the USA.

 
... 4.8 Home Base (HB) 
 
 The port mutually agreed by both the Company and the Officer from where the Officer normally starts and ends a Duty Cycle.

 
... 4.10 Preferred Port (PP) [TI] 
 
 The CPA [Cathay Pacific] passenger on-line port mutually agreed by both the Company and the Officer which is not the Officer's HB but from where the Company may schedule the Officer to start and/or end a Duty Cycle.
An Officer's Preferred Port must be located within the Officer's Base Area' 
 


 
15 According to Captain Philip Richard Walker, General Manager, Aircrew of Cathay Pacific, there are four Home Bases within the Australian Base Area being Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.
16 As indicated in clause 16.1 of the Permanent Basings Policy Agreement 2006, Sydney is the Base Administrative Centre for the Australian and New Zealand Base Areas.
17 Clause 6.9 of the Permanent Basings Policy Agreement 2006 provided for the crew establishment in each Home Base to be determined by Cathay Pacific.
18 A number of provisions within the Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited Conditions of Service 2002 make reference to aircrew with a Home Base in Hong Kong and aircrew with Home Bases elsewhere (see for example clauses 38 and 39).
19 Clauses 44 and 45 contemplate applications by aircrew to be temporarily based in ports other than their Home Base or to be permanently based in such ports.
Clause 50 deals with the situation which arises where a Home Base is closed in which case an opportunity is afforded to the relevant aircrew to relocate to another Home Base within the relevant Base Area or to Hong Kong.
20 Clause 51.1 dealt with the possibility of the applicant being 'wound up' or otherwise ceasing to operate, in which case aircrew were to 'rejoin' Cathay Pacific in their existing rank and grade on Cathay Pacific Conditions of Service, Veta on Veta Conditions of Service or USAB on USAB Conditions of Service.
Alternatively, they could apply to join NZBL on NZBL Conditions of Service.
21 Matters dealt with by the Overseas Aircrew Basing Limited Conditions of Service 2002 included Terms of Employment (clause 3), Salary (clause 7, when taken with Schedule 1), Rostering (clause 21), Crew Positioning (clause 22), Annual Leave (clause 25), Guaranteed Days Off (clause 26), Statutory Holidays (clause 27), Sickness Allowance (clause 28), Compassionate Leave (clause 29), Maternity Leave (clause 30), Redundancy (clause 31), Discipline and Grievance (clause 32), Suspension of Employment (clause 33), Termination of Employment (clause 34) and Retirement (clause 35).
22 Clauses 3 and 7 relevantly provided:
 '3.

 ...' 
 


 
23 Schedule 1 to the Conditions contained various salary scales.
One such scale was headed:
 'Australian Base --- AUD Salary Applicable to Officers whose Base Administration Centre is Sydney' 

 
Another was headed:
 'Australian Base --- AUD Salary Applicable to Officers whose Base Administration Centre is Sydney who were employed by CPA prior to 1st April 1993' 

 
and a third was headed:
 'AUSTRALIAN BASED FREIGHTER AIRCREW ANNUAL BASIC SALARY 2006' 

 A separate question 
 
24 In opening the applicant's case, senior counsel for the applicant, Mr A H Slater QC said:
 'The issue which divides the parties is whether the income of pilots employed by the applicant is exempt from tax under section 23AG [of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the 1936 Act')].
If the income is wholly exempt then there is no fringe benefits tax payable in respect of benefits provided to the pilots.
If the income is partly exempt then there'll be consequences which the parties are agreed should not tax your Honour but rather, if your Honour can decide the extent to which the income is exempt or the criteria by reference to which it is exempt in your Honour's reasons and then stand the matter over, the parties will do the calculations and resolve the differences.
In other words, we're not going to ask your Honour to do elaborate calculations of the amount of fringe benefits tax.
' 

 
25 The Court's response to this approach was to suggest that an order should be made in accordance with Order 29 rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') for the decision of a defined question separately from other questions and before any further trial in the proceedings.
This suggestion was soundly rejected by senior counsel for the applicant because, firstly, he said that a separate question had not been formulated and, secondly, 'formulating separate questions generally involves more controversy than simply dealing with the matter'.
26 In the circumstances, senior counsel for the applicant proposed that the Court should, without formally ordering the decision of a separate question in accordance with Order 29 rule 2 of the Rules, decide the following question namely:
 'Whether the income derived by the seven pilots, whose rosters are tendered in evidence, from the services they provide to the applicant, is exempt from tax and, if partly, to what extent?
' 

 
27 The reference to 'the seven pilots (whose rosters are tendered in evidence)' is a reference to seven individual pilots out of 116 who have been selected for the purposes of these proceedings as typical, being the pilots who are the subject of Pilot Rosters 2, 43, 58, 71, 75, 82 and 104.
The rosters themselves are seven pages in length for each of pilots 2, 43, 58, 71, 75 and 104, the roster for pilot 82 being six pages in length.
They each cover the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007, although the last entry for pilot 43 is shown as 30 March 2007.
28 These pilot rosters were selected by the parties as illustrative of the various combinations and permutations, sufficient to enable the matters of principle to be determined, without the necessity of exploring the detail of each and every member of the applicant's aircrew's circumstances.
29 Mr Slater has invited the Court to address the question as formulated by him in paragraph 26 above on the basis that, once it has been decided, the matter should be stood over for a period of three months to allow the parties to bring in short minutes to give effect to the Court's reasons for judgment.
30 Senior counsel for the respondent, Mr B J Sullivan SC, invited the Court to proceed generally along the lines that Mr Slater proposed.
31 I note that for the purposes of Order 29 of the Rules, 'question' includes any question or issue in any proceeding, whether of fact or law or partly of fact and partly of law, and whether raised by pleadings, agreement of parties or otherwise.
32 In the foregoing circumstances, I will proceed to address the question as formulated by Mr Slater on the basis that a precise formulation of it and the Court's decision thereon will be settled at the conclusion of this part of the appeal.
I must say that I would have preferred a greater degree of formality.
The tortuous path leading to s 23AG of the 1936 Act 
 
33 In explaining why liability for fringe benefits tax is to be determined, in this case, by the true meaning of s 23AG of the 1936 Act, senior counsel for the applicant was less than complimentary about the drafting of the relevant legislation.
His criticism appears to be well founded.
34 To enable the question as agreed between the parties to be determined it is necessary to turn to, firstly the FBT Act, secondly the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('the Administration Act') and Schedule 1 thereto, thirdly the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the 1997 Act') and, fourthly, the 1936 Act.
At times one senses that one is caught in a maze, where there is no way out.
35 The path that one must follow is as follows:
 
(a) Section 136 of the FBT Act contains a number of definitions under the heading 'Interpretation'.
Relevantly, the important definitions for present purposes, not necessarily recorded in strict alphabetical order, are as follows:
 '136(1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears: 
 
 
 ... 
 " fringe benefit ", in relation to an employee, in relation to the employer of the employee, in relation to a year of tax, means a benefit: 
 
 (a) provided at any time during the year of tax; or 
 
 (b) provided in respect of the year of tax; 
 
 being a benefit provided to the employee or to an associate of the employee by: 
 
 (c) the employer; ... 
 ... 
 in respect of the employment of the employee... 
 ... 
 " employee ", means: 
 
 (a) a current employee; 
 ...; or 
 (c) a former employee 
 ... 
 current employee means a person who receives, or is entitled to receive, salary or wages.

 ... 
 " former employee " means a person who has been a current employee.

 ... 
 " employer" means: 
 
 (a) a current employer; 
 ...; or 
 (c) a former employer 
 ... 
 ... 
 current employer means a person ... who pays, or is liable to pay, salary or wages... 
 ... 
 " former employer" means a person who has been a current employer.

 ... 
 salary or wages means: 
 
 
 
(a) a payment from which an amount must be withheld (even if the amount is not withheld) under a provision in Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 listed in the table, to the extent that the payment is assessable income; ... ... 
 
 
 [At the conclusion of the definition of salary or wages a table appeared which included under the heading ' Withholding payments covered ' a reference to s 12-35 of the Administration Act in relation to 'Payment to employee'] '.

 
 
 

I should digress to indicate that the applicant submits that if payments to the selected aircrew members are not payments to employees within the meaning of s 12-35 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act, then such payments are not 'salary or wages' with the consequence that the relevant recipient is not a 'current employee' and therefore not an 'employee' and, consequentially, the amount paid in respect of the recipient is not a fringe benefit.
(b) In relation to the withholding of amounts from payments to employees s 12-35 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act provided as follows:
 '12-35 An entity must withhold an amount from salary, wages, commission, bonuses or allowances it pays to an individual as an employee (whether of that or another entity).
' 
Section 12-35 was itself subject to the exceptions which are to be found in s 12-1 of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act.
(c) Section 12-1(1) of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act relevantly provided:
 
 
 
 '12-1(1) An entity need not withhold an amount under section 12-35 ... from a payment if the whole of the payment is exempt income of the entity receiving the payment.
' 
 
 
 

As an aside, I should indicate that the respondent places emphasis on 'if the whole of the payment'.
(d) By virtue of s 3AA(2) of the Administration Act expressions used in Schedule 1 to the Administration Act have the same meanings as they have in the 1997 Act.
The definitions in the 1997 Act are to be found in s 995-1 which spans some 180 pages.
Apart from the definitions contained in s 995-1 of the 1997 Act there are expressions that are defined elsewhere in the 1997 Act, which supplement those definitions eg the definition of 'entity' in s 960-100 of the 1997 Act.
(e) One added complication lies in the fact that in s 995-1(1) of the 1997 Act ' this Act ' is defined to include:
 
 
 
 '(a) the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ; and 
 
 (b) Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 , so far as that Part relates to: 
 
 
 
(i) this Act or the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ; or (ii) Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; and 
 
 
 (c) Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ; 
 
 except in Division 950 (Rules for interpreting this Act)' 
 
 


 
(f) In this context, the expression 'exempt income' as used in s 12-1(1) of Schedule 1 to the Administration Act is defined by s 995-1(1) of the 1997 Act as follows:
 
 
 
 '995-1(1) In this Act [an expression having the expanded meaning referred to above] , except so far as the contrary intention appears: 
 
 
... exempt income has the meaning given by section 6-20' 
(g) In s 6-20 of the 1997 Act 'exempt income' was defined, inter alia, as follows:
 
 
 
 '6-20(1) An amount of ordinary income or statutory income is exempt income if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this Act [which has the extended meaning referred to above] or another Commonwealth law.
' 
 
 
 

[Section 6-5(1) and 6-10(2) of the 1997 Act provided as follows:
 
 
 
 '6-5(1) Your assessable income includes income according to ordinary concepts, which is called ordinary income .
... 
 6-10(2) Amounts that are not ordinary income, but are included in your assessable income by provisions about assessable income, are called statutory income .
' ]
 
 
 

It is common ground between the parties that wages and salary are ordinary income within the meaning of s 6-20(1) of the 1997 Act.
(h) 'Entity' where used in s 12-1(1) of the Administration Act is defined in s 995-1(1) of the 1997 Act, subject to the preamble (see (f) above), as follows:
 
 
 
 '995-1(1) ... 
 
 
entity has the meaning given by section 960-100' 

 
(i) Section 960-100 of the 1997 Act provided, inter alia as follows:
 '960-100(1) Entity means any of the following: 
 
 
 (a) an individual; 
 (b) a body corporate; 
 (c) a body politic; 
 (d) a partnership; 
 
 
(e) any other unincorporated association or body of persons; (f) a trust; (g) a superannuation fund; ...' 
At the foot of s 960-100(1) a 'Note' appears which provided:
 'Note: the term entity is used in a number of different but related senses.
It covers all kinds of legal person.
It also covers groups of legal persons, and other things, that in practice are treated as having a separate identity in the same way as a legal person does.
' 
Thankfully, I need go no further, in this case, than focussing my attention upon subparagraphs (a) and (b).
(j) Another complication which arises from the legislative path that one must follow to try and make sense of the FBT Act is posed by s 3AA(3) of the Administration Act which provided:
 
 
 
 '3AA(3) Division 950 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (which contains rules for interpreting that Act) applies to Schedule 1 to this Act as if the provisions in that Schedule were provisions of that Act' 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Division 950 of the 1997 Act contained 'Rules for interpreting this Act' [where 'this Act' does not have the extended meaning for which s 995-1(1) provided].
