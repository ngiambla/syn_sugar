 Introduction
 Ms Jane Rutter is a professional flautist.
Between 1989 and 2007 she released eleven albums in Australia and has sold her albums both in Australia and in other countries.
At various times in her career she has performed as a soloist with very well-known international musicians.
Ms Rutter is also a composer.
In late 1992, according to her evidence, she composed and wrote a melody which she called "Blo".
The eight bars of the melody were written on a scrap piece of manuscript which was subsequently lost.
In mid 1993 she wrote a complete musical piece based on the melody.
The manuscript was in evidence.
Her fourth album was entitled "Blo" and was released in 1996.
This album included an arrangement of Blo.
The essence of Ms Rutter's claim in the present proceedings is that her copyright as author of Blo was infringed when the first respondent which, as will be seen, was in 1999 granted a 12 month licence to reproduce the score of the melody for specified purposes, continued thereafter to do so without her permission.
Brookland Valley Estate Pty Limited ("Brookland Valley") is the operating company of the Brookland Valley vineyard in the Margaret River region of Western Australia.
The land upon which the vineyard is situated was acquired by the second respondent, the family trust company of Mr Malcolm Jones and his wife, Mrs Deidre Jones, in 1983.
The first wines were produced in 1988.
In 1993 the family trust, JFT (WA) Pty Limited ("JFT"), went into partnership with a company called Mulloway Pty Limited ("Mulloway").
In 1997 BRL Hardy Limited (later Hardy Wine Company Limited and then Constellation Australia Limited) ("BRL Hardy") acquired a 50% interest in the vineyard.
From that time the business operated as a joint venture under the name of the first respondent in which BRL Hardy had a 50 percent interest, JFT a 25 percent interest and Mulloway a 25 percent interest.
Proceedings against JFT were settled before the matter came to trial.
Although Mulloway and BRL Hardy had, respectively, one and two representatives on the board of Brookland Valley, day to day management was retained by Mr and Mrs Jones with assistance from BRL Hardy.
Mr Jones was managing director of Brookland Valley from 1997 until September 2004 and then acted as a consultant to Brookland Valley until December 2004.
From 1997 to 2004 Mrs Jones was employed by Brookland Valley as the marketing manager.
The Verse 1 range
 On 21 October 1997, not long after the establishment of the joint venture, Mr Jones as managing director of Brookland Valley made a proposal to the board that two new brands be introduced to the range to supplement the existing Brookland Valley brand.
One was described as a "Margaret River" brand.
The proposal for the third brand was discontinued a short time later but the proposal for the new Margaret River brand continued.
Mrs Jones was closely involved, both professionally and personally, in the development of a marketing strategy.
The development of that strategy became intimately connected with a statue (which Mr and Mrs Jones knew as "Pan", but which a witness in the proceedings identified as "Daphnis") which they had purchased in 1978.
Mrs Jones described the matter as follows: 
 "Malcolm and I purchased the statue of Pan in 1978 in an antique shop in Double Bay, Sydney.
When we purchased the land to become the Brookland Valley Vineyard I came up with the idea of placing the statue on a rock on the land.
The statue had become a symbol in our family of enjoying the good life, music, fun and wine.
This was also our approach to making wine.
Over the initial years of developing the winery the family often held parties around the statue and decorated it for Christmas, making it an important part of our family history.


 
 In 1988 Malcolm and I decided to place an image of the Pan statue on the first wines produced by Brookland Valley Vineyard.
From 1990 when the Flutes Caf was established I came up with the idea of placing the Pan statue on a rock at the front of the restaurant.
We often played Pan music in the restaurant.
The statue and story of Pan became strongly connected to Brookland Valley Vineyard and was often used in our marketing initiatives from the very beginning of the winery.
" 

 It was decided that the new brand would be called the "Verse 1" range.
Mrs Jones said: 
 "Given that the new range sought to engage a new market for Brookland Valley and was the winery's second label, I considered that it was important to launch the product in a way to attract the interest of retailers, restaurateurs and wine media.


 
 It was in this context that I drew the association between Pan, as a flautist and the possibility of the launches involving a musical performance.
I also came up with an idea to have music incorporated in the label and to have a CD produced which was associated with Pan and the second label.
This CD could then be played in the Flutes Caf and Gallery and in the restaurants and retail stores which stocked Verse 1.


 
 Getting retailers, restaurateurs, wine media and wine judges to attend a launch of a winery's second label is very difficult.
As such, I anticipated that there would be a need for a reasonably large budget to have a launch which would entice their attendance.


 
 In or about late 1997 or early 1998 my concept for the launch of the second label involved having a flautist play at each of the launch functions which would be likely to be held in Sydney, Melbourne and either Perth or Margaret River.
My initial idea was to hire a local flautist in each city.
I also came up with a mock up idea for the label to include an excerpt of a piece of music which was to be associated with the second label.
My idea was that the piece of music on the label would be played by the flautist at the launch functions.
" 

 Mrs Jones developed the idea of involving Ms Rutter.
She said: 
 "I thought that she would be a good fit with the concept I was developing which incorporated Pan and his magical panflute and I thought that given that she had not been performing for some time, she may be willing to be involved in the launch of the second label.


 
 My original marketing concept involved Jane performing at launch functions and composing a piece of music which could be associated with Verse 1 and Pan.
I wanted the piece to be called Pan's Song.
Also part of my concept was for a CD to be compiled with Pan's Song and some other tracks to be given away at the launch functions and to the retailers and restaurateurs as an incentive.
" 

 The concept was discussed at a meeting on 12 and 13 November 1998 where Mr and Mrs Jones and representatives of BRL Hardy were present.
It was decided that the Verse 1 range would be constituted, at least initially, by a white wine, a Semillon Sauvignon Blanc from 1999, and a red wine, a Cabernet Merlot from 1998.
The proposed involvement of Ms Rutter was discussed.
The following was recorded: 
 "Promotion: Malcolm outlined plans to involve Jane Rutter as a Verse 1 ambassador.
This was well received and all agreed support on this scale was required to achieve the sales distribution and growth targeted.
Negotiations are continuing.
" 

 In a 1999 Australian Marketing Plan prepared for Brookland Valley by the brand manager, Mr Hornabrook, in November 1998 sales of the Verse 1 brand were forecast at 9,500 cases (114,000 bottles) but when the 1999 Australian Marketing Plan was discussed at a meeting on 16 December 1998 it was recorded that wine volumes would be reduced to 7,500 cases (90,000 bottles).
The record of the same meeting included the observation: 
 "Jane Rutter contract:
 Malcolm and Dee to finalise negotiations with Jane Rutter's management for the promotion of Verse 1.
This contract should be for a minimum of 2 years with agreement to make personal appearances, perform, endorse and provide exclusive rights to a CD of selected music tracks.
A meeting in Sydney is planned for Tuesday 23 February to finalise the launch activities.
" 

 Use of Ms Rutter's services and music
 From mid 1998 to mid 1999 Ms Rutter was represented by Mr Roy Ferin.
They fell out in mid 1999 but before that happened negotiations had commenced with Mr Ferin to involve Ms Rutter in promotion of the Verse 1 range.
A report made by Mr Jones to the Brookland Valley board for the 1998 December quarter board meeting recorded: 
 "The Verse 1 label will be released in late September 1999 and bearing in mind the significant future production of this label a substantial promotional budget has been prepared.
The package includes use of Jane Rutter in the production of a piece of music and a CD.
" 

 Ms Rutter did not become personally involved in negotiations until 23 February 1999 when she attended a meeting in Sydney with Mr and Mrs Jones and Mr Ferin.
Mr and Mrs Jones and Ms Rutter each gave evidence about the conversation at that meeting.
Mr Ferin was not called to give evidence by either Ms Rutter or Brookland Valley.
I am satisfied that he was not, by the time these proceedings came to be heard and for a considerable time prior to that, in the camp of either side.
No inference is available from the failure of either side to compel him to give evidence.
However, the passage of time (ten years), the fact that nobody made any note of the meeting but relied instead upon recollection to attempt to recreate the substance of the conversation and that no independent version of events was available means that the evidence about what was said at the meeting needs to be approached with considerable caution.
Both parties agreed that the arrangement between them had later been captured in a written form.
However, a matter of considerable difficulty for the resolution of the present case is that no written contract was ever finally executed and there was some real lack of certainty about which documents should be regarded as stating the final terms of the agreement which was made.
Nevertheless, resolution of those matters does not depend upon preferring any particular version of the conversation which took place on 23 February 1999.
I am satisfied that, at that time, both Ms Rutter and Mrs Jones in particular were very enthusiastic, both about the concept and Ms Rutter's participation in it.
The 1999 Australian Marketing Plan was presented to a meeting of the board on 25 February 1999, two days after the meeting with Ms Rutter in Sydney.
Apart from the meeting on 23 February 1999, negotiations took place, up to mid 1999, through the agency of Mr Ferin.
Central to the concept which Mrs Jones had developed was the provision by Ms Rutter of an original piece of music.
She had in mind that the piece of music would be performed and promoted to the public in various ways.
First, it would be performed for the purpose of creating a complimentary music CD upon which would also be recorded other pieces of Ms Rutter's music.
The CD would be paid for by Brookland Valley and would be available to restaurants and bottle shops as a promotional tool associated with the Verse 1 range.
Naturally, one benefit to Ms Rutter would be a greater exposure of the public to her music.
Arrangements for the production of the CD were negotiated between Mr Ferin and Mr Hornabrook of BRL Hardy.
The recording was made in early 1999.
A second aspect of the overall arrangement was the proposal that Ms Rutter perform the original piece of music and other music on three occasions: 9 August 1999 in Melbourne, 11 August 1999 in Sydney and 20 November 1999 at the Brookland Valley vineyard.
In due course it became necessary to alter the date and location of the third performance which occurred finally in mid 2000 in Brisbane.
The third aspect of the arrangement was that Ms Rutter would provide a manuscript of the original composition for reproduction on the Verse 1 label.
She provided the score of the melody of Blo and later played Blo at each of the three launches, in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.
While negotiations were going on about the terms upon which Ms Rutter would licence the use of her original composition she approved, on 13 May 1999, artwork for the label which in due course appeared on the Verse 1 range.
The front label for Verse 1 wines showed an image of a young, impish, naked, male flautist, together with three staves (12 bars) of Ms Rutter's music.
The back label included the words: "Pan's Song written by Jane Rutter".
Ms Rutter described the significance of the music which she approved for reproduction on the label in the following way: 
 "Collectively, this part of the composition is the centrepiece of Blo.
The complete musical piece of Blo lasts for around four minutes.
Of the 12 bars of the melody of Blo depicted on the [label], I believe the relative significance of the bars of music in the context of the complete musical piece are as follows: 

 
 (a) The first set of 4 bars of music on the first stave are the crux of melody.
These 30 odd notes form the expositional statement and are the most important part of the composition.
Without this melody, the composition would not exist.
The scale used is an Aeolian mode (A D Minor scale with an added note --- a flattened 7 th as well as a raised 7 th ).
The scale has two 7ths in it which has an emotional, ethnic and historical relevance.
The melody is Greek/Middle Europe and exotic in style.
The rhythm is that of a Pagan dance.
It has both Classical and Greek as well as cross-over influences.
It is an unusual and distinctive melody and rhythm.
If played on a flute, the first 4 bars would have a duration of between 10 and 13 seconds.
It is the genesis of Blo.


 
 (b) The second set of 4 bars of music (appearing on the middle stave of music) are also very important and represent the completion of the most important part of Blo's melody.
If played on a flute, the 4 bars would have a duration of between 10 and 13 seconds.
The music in the first and second set of 4 bars is repeated several times throughout the entire 4 minute composition.


 
 (c) The third set of 4 bars of music (appearing on the bottom stave of music) is an embellishment of the first set of 4 bars of music which forms the centrepiece of the composition and melody.
" 

 In the first instance, three staves of music, each of four bars, appeared on the label of Verse 1 wines.
As will be seen the label was changed in 2006.
Thereafter, only the first stave of music appeared --- described by Ms Rutter as the crux of the melody.
The license arrangement
 The task of determining the terms of the final arrangement has been made more difficult by the fact that neither side kept full records.
Indeed, despite the fact that Mr Jones gave evidence that he left all records connected with the negotiations at Brookland Valley Vineyard when he ceased to be managing director of Brookland Valley and the fact that there was evidence of a thorough search for such records, Brookland Valley was not able to produce any written record of, or arising from, the negotiations.
Ms Rutter's records were incomplete.
They consisted of documents which were sent to her from time to time by Mr Ferin.
Some of them bore handwritten annotations by her which appeared to find reflection in later versions of the document.
There were a number of documents transferred by facsimile from Mr Ferin to Ms Rutter.
They included three draft agreements and some other documents, in the form of letters, dated 21 May 1999 intended, apparently, to be transmitted by facsimile to Mr and Mrs Jones.
Mr and Mrs Jones both stated in their evidence that they had no recollection of ever seeing the letters apparently intended to be sent to them by facsimile.
There is no other objective indication that they were.
They might just as easily have been drafts of letters sent to Ms Rutter for her examination.
I am not prepared to assume, in the absence of any evidence, that these communications were ever made by Mr Ferin to Mr and Mrs Jones.
However, it is possible to make confident findings about a number of matters.
On 28 July 1999, Mr Jones wrote to Ms Rutter.
Mr Ferin had been dismissed only a matter of days before.
In his letter Mr Jones described the essential features of the arrangement which had been agreed.
He proposed a small number of changes to the terms of a draft contract which was obviously before him.
He proposed to make payment of the bulk of the agreed payment within a matter of days and in fact did so.
Indeed, by mistake, the payment was made twice and Ms Rutter refunded the overpayment.
Those events, which require more detailed examination, provide a foundation for determining the written terms of the arrangement which, although not signed by Mr Jones and Ms Rutter, is nevertheless evidenced in writing and by the payment and acceptance of the contract payment then due.
There were four drafts in evidence of a document entitled "Jane Rutter Agreement for Services".
The fourth document post dated critical events and the time at which the contract was concluded.
Nobody suggested that it accurately set out the concluded terms of the agreement.
It requires no further attention.
The first three documents were sent by facsimile transmission from Mr Ferin to Ms Rutter on 19 May 1999, 23 June 1999 and 29 June 1999 respectively.
The documents were progressively more detailed.
It seems to me possible to exclude two of the documents as the one before Mr Jones on 28 July 1999, when he wrote to Ms Rutter.
I shall discuss this matter again in more detail when the specific terms of the contract, as I have found it, have been set out.
However, it is possible to commence to narrow the field by reference to the surrounding circumstances.
It is convenient to deal first with the document sent to Ms Rutter on 23 June 1999.
Ms Rutter's evidence was inconclusive.
However, it seems unlikely that the contract agreed was the version faxed to Ms Rutter on 23 June 1999.
That document indicated that the contract would be between Ms Rutter, Mr Ferin and Brookland Valley Vineyards.
The later version sent to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999 indicated that the contract would be signed by Ms Rutter only and Brookland Valley Vineyards.
A suggestion made by Mr Jones in his letter of 28 July 1999 --- "Change Address in document to Jane Rutter" --- is consistent with the later version of 29 June 1999.
The second document contained handwritten notes by Ms Rutter which found substantial reflection in the third document.
I think it unlikely that Mr Ferin sent this version as a neutral participant both to Ms Rutter and to Brookland Valley.
He was representing Ms Rutter.
I think it much more likely that it was sent to Ms Rutter for consideration, before being sent to Brookland Valley if acceptable to her.
There are further matters of detail referred to shortly which also contributed to my conclusion that the second version did not form the basis of the final contract.
The first document, of 19 May 1999, does not match the terms of the document which was obviously before Mr Jones at the time he made his suggestions for inclusion in the final contract.
Mr Jones' evidence was that to the best of his recollection he only ever saw one version of the "Jane Rutter Agreement for Services".
In his affidavit evidence he said in two places that he believed it was likely that document was the version sent by Mr Ferin to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999 or an earlier version.
In his oral evidence Mr Jones made some attempt to suggest that he probably had before him the first version and not some later version.
I am not prepared to accept that evidence.
As will be seen shortly Mr Jones, on 28 July 1999, made specific suggestions for final amendment of whatever document he had before him.
Those suggestions cannot be reconciled with the terms of the first version.
I am satisfied it was not the first version which was before him.
The third document, sent to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999, bore the notation "Draft #5".
It is unclear whether this notation, which does not appear on any other version, referred to drafts given to Ms Rutter for her consideration or drafts provided to Brookland Valley.
It is impossible to be certain that there was not some other document before Mr Jones of which no record now remains but, having regard to the terms of the proposals which he made and the general description that he offered Ms Rutter of the arrangement, I am satisfied that the version sent to Ms Rutter on 29 June 1999 reflects, in substance, the terms of the bargain finally concluded.
At the time he made his final suggestions, Mr Jones also had before him a facsimile from Ms Rutter dated 27 July 1999.
Ms Rutter and Mr Ferin had fallen out a few days earlier.
In a facsimile dated 24 July 1999 Mr Ferin proposed, nevertheless, that he continue as event co-ordinator for the events which had been arranged, while engaging someone else to actually manage the events, and work with Ms Rutter, on the days in question.
On 26 July 1999, Ms Rutter sent a facsimile transmission to Mr Ferin indicating her lack of understanding of the state of negotiations but protesting that a contract should earlier have been concluded.
Mr Ferin replied on the following day indicating that Mr Jones had "agreed to pay $27,500 by this Friday," a figure which I will shortly explain.
Mr Ferin also alerted Ms Rutter to the possibility that the proposed performance at Brookland Valley Vineyard in November might need to be postponed.
He said that, subject to one or two matters, "there's no problems with the Agreement" from Mr Jones' standpoint.
This gives further support to my conclusion that the document receiving Mr Jones' endorsement was not one of the early versions.
Ms Rutter's facsimile transmission to Mr Jones of 27 July 1999 said the following: 
 "Dear Malcolm 

 
 Further to our conversation today, I enclose my account number.
As agreed you will deposit $27,500 into this account.
The remaining $7,500 will be settled by 30 th November 1999.


 
 I have no problem with changing the dates in November.
I would like this to be as successful as possible for you.
I have turned down work for this to the tune of about $10,000 so how about settling $1,000 worth of Verse 1 wine on me?!!
(as compensation).
Please let me know your thoughts!


 
 Account J. E. RUTTER
 [Account details omitted] 

 
 PS I hope this is OK" 

 It is evident that Mr Jones understood that Ms Rutter was not fully familiar with the course of negotiations and perhaps not with the significance of the document about which he, the following day, was to make final suggestions.
His letter dated 28 July 1999 should be set out in full: 
 "Date: 28 th July 1999
