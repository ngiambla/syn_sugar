 On 2 December 2008, I made a number of orders in a proceeding brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the Commission") against Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd ("Skins"), Mr Jaimie Royston Fuller and Mr Christopher Thomas Warhurst.
The proceeding consists of two parts.
In the first part of the proceeding, the Commission alleged that Skins, by making various representations, engaged in conduct, in trade or commerce, that was misleading or deceptive, or was likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
In the second part of the proceeding, the Commission alleged that Skins engaged in the practice of resale price maintenance in contravention of s 48 of the Act, and that Mr Warhurst was, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, the contraventions by Skins.
There were detailed discussions between the parties and, as a result of those discussions, they were able to agree a number of matters.
In relation to the misleading or deceptive conduct allegations, I was given draft consent orders and I admitted in evidence a statement of agreed facts.
In relation to the resale price maintenance allegations, I was given draft consent orders and I admitted in evidence joint submissions of the applicant and respondents and a statement of agreed facts.
The statements of agreed facts were in the form required by s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and they were admitted in evidence pursuant to that section.
These are my reasons for the orders I made on 2 December 2008.
The respondents
 It is convenient to begin with a brief description of the respondents and the businesses they were engaged in at the relevant times.
Skins is a body incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), is liable to sue and be sued in its corporate name and is a trading corporation within the definition of that term in s 4 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act").
At all material times, Mr Royston was the sole director of Skins.
The company carried on a business, in trade or commerce, as the supplier of compression sports performance garments ("Skins products") to a distributor and retailers across Australia, and as a retailer of Skins products to the general public in Australia via telephone and internet sales.
Mr Warhurst was the sole director and shareholder of Artipena Springs Pty Ltd, which was incorporated in or about September 2002.
Mr Warhurst was an employee, servant or agent of the company.
The company traded as Warhurst Agencies, and I will refer to it in that way.
At all material times, Mr Warhurst acted within the scope of his actual or apparent authority as an employee or agent of Warhurst Agencies.
Warhurst Agencies carried on a business whereby it acted as agent for suppliers of sports goods including sports clothing, footwear and equipment.
In that role, Warhurst Agencies was involved in the promotion of the products of the suppliers to sports retail stores in South Australia and the obtaining of orders for the suppliers' products.
In performing those tasks, employees and representatives of Warhurst Agencies, including Mr Warhurst, regularly visited retailers or potential retailers of products supplied by suppliers for whom Warhurst Agencies acted as agent.
In October 2004, Warhurst Agencies acted as agent for various suppliers of sports goods.
On 30 October 2004, Skins and Warhurst Agencies entered into an agreement whereby the latter agreed to act as Skins' agent in respect of the sale of Skins products in consideration whereof Skins agreed to pay a commission on all payments received on orders placed by Warhurst Agencies.
Misleading or deceptive conduct
 A summary of the relief I granted in relation to the misleading or deceptive conduct allegations by the applicant is as follows: I made five declarations of conduct by the first respondent, in trade or commerce, which was misleading or deceptive, or was likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the Act; and I made orders for corrective advertising by Skins via the home pages of websites on the Internet, the SBS national television network, and a publication called the B  T Weekly .
In addition, the first and second respondents each gave an undertaking to the Court.
Those undertakings are in the following terms: 
 "Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd (ACN 110 666 923) ('Skins') the First Respondent in these proceedings gives the following undertakings to the Court.


 Skins undertakes to the Court that Skins shall not, by itself, its servants, agents or otherwise howsoever, for a period of 3 years from the date of these undertakings, market, promote or sell its products by making representations that:
 
 1.1 it does not pay money for sports stars to wear Skins products;
 1.2 it does not pay money for sports stars to endorse Skins products; and/or
 1.3 it does not provide Skins products for sports stars to wear unless the Skins products are paid for with money; 

 
 or representations to similar effect, unless the representations are true.


 Skins undertakes to the Court that Skins shall not, by itself, its servants, agents or otherwise howsoever, for a period of 3 years from the date of these Orders, induce or attempt to induce, any person or corporation not to sell or advertise Skins products supplied to it by Skins for sale at a price less than a price specified by Skins.
"
 
 "Jaimie Royston Fuller, the Second Respondent in these proceedings gives the following undertaking to the Court.


 I undertake to the Court that I will not, for a period of 3 years from the date of this undertaking, be in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, Skins Compression Garments Pty Ltd (ACN 110 666 923), or any other corporation whether by itself, its servants, agents or otherwise howsoever, marketing, promoting or selling Skins products by making representations that:
 
 1.1 Skins does not pay money for sports stars to wear Skins products;
 1.2 Skins does not pay money for sports stars to endorse Skins products;
 1.3 Skins does not provide Skins products for sports stars to wear unless the Skins products are paid for with money, 

 
 or representations to a similar effect, unless the representations are true.
" 

 As far as the five declarations are concerned, the Court's power to make binding declarations of right is contained in s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
In the ordinary case, a Court will not make a declaration by consent unless it is satisfied by evidence that it should do so.
In this case, I have the statement of agreed facts under s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and, by reason of that section, evidence is not required to prove the existence of the agreed facts.
In addition to being satisfied by evidence that it is appropriate to make the declarations sought, I must be satisfied that I have the power to make the declarations and that they are appropriate: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 (" Real Estate Institute ").
The power to make orders for corrective advertising is contained in s 86C of the Act and the power to accept undertakings of the nature proffered is part of the power to grant injunctions in s 80 of the Act.
Again, as with the declarations, the Court must be satisfied that it has the power to accept the undertakings and that they are appropriate, although the Court will not substitute its own view for that of the parties if the undertakings fall within an appropriate disposition of the case: Real Estate Institute at 87, 89 [21], [26] per French J.
Skins admits that, on a number of occasions, it engaged in conduct, in trade and commerce, that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the Act.
At the heart of the contravening conduct were three representations.
The first representation was that Skins did not pay money to sports stars, or their representatives, clubs, teams or governing bodies, for the sports stars to wear Skins products.
The parties referred to this as the "no payment to wear" representation, and it is convenient to adopt that shorthand way of referring to the representation.
The second representation was that Skins did not provide Skins products to sports stars, or their representatives, clubs, teams or governing bodies, unless the Skins products were paid for with money.
The parties referred to this representation as the "always paid for" representation and again it is convenient for me to do likewise.
The third representation was that Skins did not pay money to sports stars, or their representatives, clubs, teams or governing bodies, for sports stars to endorse Skins products.
The parties referred to this representation as the "no payment to endorse" representation, and again it is convenient for me to do likewise.
From about June 2005, Skins undertook a significant and award-winning advertising campaign in relation to Skins products.
The campaign consisted of print advertising, radio advertising, television advertising and the marketing of Skins products on its website.
I will deal with each form of advertising in turn.
Print advertising
 The print advertising took place between June and October 2005 and involved Skins causing advertisements for Skins products to be published in the print media in various parts of Australia.
It is not necessary for me to outline the names of the print media in which the advertisements appeared or when that happened.
Three versions of the print advertisements were published.
Each version of the print advertisements: 
(1) contained the statement "[w]e don't pay sports stars to wear our products.
