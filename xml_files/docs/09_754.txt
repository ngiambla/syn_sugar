 The Australian Communications and Media Authority has applied for orders that Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd pay pecuniary penalties pursuant to s 205F(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) in respect of 13 breaches of a condition in Radio 2UE's commercial radio broadcasting licence and for declarations recording each contravention.
Each breach contravened s 140A(3) of the Act and attracted liability for a civil penalty (s 140A(7)).
Each contravention attracted a maximum civil penalty of 500 penalty units, a total of $55,000 (see ss 139(3), 140A(3), 205F(4)).
The breaches occurred over the course of 2 months in late 2007 when the well-known broadcaster, John Laws, failed to make disclosure announcements that he was sponsored by businesses at the time and as part of the broadcasts in which his sponsors', or their products' or services', names were mentioned during the course of his morning radio program, The John Laws Morning Show .
I have attached a description of each contravention in a schedule to these reasons taken from the Authority's investigation report No 2100 of October 2008.
Mr Laws was paid very large sums of money by these businesses for their sponsorship.
The Authority had made a program standard known as the Broadcasting Services (Commercial Radio Current Affairs Disclosure) Standard 2000 pursuant to s 125 of the Act.
The disclosure standard commenced in January 2001.
It had been made following a report of the Authority's predecessor, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, called the " Commercial Radio Enquiry ".
That had enquired into a broadcasting practice colloquially referred to as "cash for comment".
The purpose of the disclosure standard was to require commercial radio licensees to ensure that whenever one of the station's presenters mentioned the name of a sponsor, or its products or services, the presenter made a disclosure announcement about his or her commercial relationship with the sponsor.
Radio 2UE had to comply with the disclosure standard because this was a condition of its commercial radio broadcasting licence by force of cl 8(1)(b) in Sch 2 of the Act.
There is no doubt that Mr Laws was fully aware of who his sponsors were and how much they were paying him on the occasion of each contravention.
But he did not comply with the obligations of Radio 2UE to make disclosure.
The parties prepared an agreed statement of facts which I will set out shortly.
They agreed that it was appropriate to suggest to the Court that a penalty of $10,000 per contravention should be imposed.
That would result in a total of $130,000 in civil penalties being payable by Radio 2UE.
The Authority and Radio 2UE suggested that these figures were appropriate to reflect a penalty at the lower end of the range having regard to all the circumstances, including Radio 2UE's immediate co-operation with the Authority's enquiry, its contrition and acceptance of responsibility for the contraventions.
In addition, Radio 2UE agreed to pay $20,000 in respect of the Authority's costs.
The maximum penalties were $55,000 per contravention or a total $715,000.
Radio 2UE submitted that a number of matters should be seen as significant mitigating factors.
It contended that, overall, its conduct warranted a conclusion that a penalty at the lower end of the range was appropriate, as the Authority had accepted.
Radio 2UE relied on the evidence of Graham Mott and his conduct in support of its position.
Mr Mott had been the group general manager for the Southern Cross Radio network from February 2003 to 8 November 2007 when it was taken over by Fairfax Media.
Since 9 November 2007 he has been the group general manager of Fairfax Radio Network where he is responsible for managing the day to day operations of 28 radio stations and ensuring their compliance with, among others, financial and legal regulatory requirements.
He has had over 40 years experience in radio broadcasting, gained largely at music and talk-back radio stations.
Mr Mott was not cross-examined.
I accept that he gave his evidence candidly and honestly.
However, I must still weigh that evidence against the objective facts, the requirements of the Act and Radio 2UE's licence.
I also accept that Mr Mott, and through him Radio 2UE, intended that Radio 2UE would comply with the disclosure standard.
But that compliance depended on its presenters', and in particular, Mr Laws', on-air behaviour.
When the matter was first listed for hearing, I was concerned that, as this was the first action for civil penalties under the Act, the relationship between the contravention and a commercial licence might involve different considerations than those in other situations permitting the imposition of civil penalties for contraventions of other legislation.
Accordingly, I asked the parties to consider whether there ought be a contradictor.
Both opposed that course.
However, the Authority identified the Communications Law Centre as a body that might be an appropriate intervenor: see Australian Communications and Media Authority v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 214.
Soon afterwards, the Centre sought to intervene.
The Centre appeared by its director, Prof Michael Fraser, and he and each of the parties provided considerable assistance at the hearing.
THE STATUTORY SCHEME 
 The objects of the Act are set out in s 3(1).
They include: Significantly, the Act provides in s 4(1): 
 "The Parliament intends that different levels of regulatory control be applied across the range of broadcasting services, data casting services and Internet services according to the degree of influence that different types of broadcasting services, data casting services and Internet services are able to exert in shaping community views in Australia .
" (emphasis added) 

 The Parliament also expressed its intention that the Authority be the body charged with the duty of regulating, relevantly, broadcasting services in a manner that, in its opinion, enabled public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that did not impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on providers of broadcasting services (s 4(2)(a)).
The Act charged the Authority with responsibility for monitoring the broadcasting industry (s 5(1)(a)).
The Act conferred on the Authority a range of functions and powers to be used in a manner that, in its opinion, would produce regulatory arrangements that were stable and predictable and would deal effectively with breaches of the rules established by the Act (s 5(1)(b)).
And, in s 5(2) the Act provided that where it was necessary for the Authority to use any of the powers conferred on it by the Act to deal with a breach of the Act or regulations: 
 "... the Parliament intends that the ACMA use its powers or a combination of its powers, in a manner that, in the opinion of the ACMA, is commensurate with the seriousness of the breach concerned.
" 

 Radio 2UE held a public licence granted under the Act, namely, a commercial radio broadcasting licence.
The licence was subject to a condition that the licensee comply with program standards applicable to the licence under Pt 9 of the Act (Sch 2, cl 8(1)(b)).
Subclause 8(1)(b) of Schedule 2 provided:
 
 " 8 Standard Conditions of Commercial Radio Broadcasting Licences 

 
 (1) Each commercial radio broadcasting licence is subject to the following conditions:
 
 ...
 (b) the licensee will comply with program standards applicable to the licensee under Pt 9 of this Act.
" 

 The disclosure standard was a program standard made applicable under Pt 9.
Relevantly, s 139(3) of the Act provided that a commercial radio licensee that engaged in conduct that breached a condition of cl 8(1)(b) of Sch 2 was guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of 500 penalty units.
THE 2006 AMENDMENTS 
 In 2006 the Communications and Legislation Amendment (Enforcement Powers) Act 2006 (Cth) was enacted.
It inserted s 140A into the Act.
That expanded the powers of the Authority to deal with breaches of licences by arming it with powers to bring civil proceedings to recover a civil penalty.
Thus, s 140A(3) provided: 
 "(3) A commercial radio broadcasting licensee must not breach a condition of the licence set out in sub cl 8(1) of Schedule 2.
" 

 The 2006 amendments also inserted s 205F.
That provided that if the Federal Court is satisfied that a person has contravened a civil penalty provision, it may order the person to pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty, known as a "civil penalty order" (s 205F(1) and (2)).
Relevantly, s 205F(3) provides: 
 "In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Federal Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including: 
 (a) the nature and extent of the contravention; and 

 
 (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and 

 
 (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and 

 
 (d) whether the person has previously been found by a court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct.
" 

 The maximum pecuniary penalty payable in respect of a contravention of a civil penalty provision cannot exceed the maximum fine that could have been imposed had the person been convicted of an offence against the provision of the Act that corresponds to the civil penalty provision (s 205F(4)).
A pecuniary penalty is a civil debt payable to the Commonwealth which it is entitled to enforce as a judgment debt (s 205F(8)).
Only the Authority may apply for a civil penalty order (s 205G(1)).
The Authority also obtained the power to accept an enforceable undertaking.
This is a written undertaking given by a person, among other things, to take specified action in order to comply with the Act (s 205W(1)(a)).
Such an undertaking is enforceable under s 205X.
The Authority may apply to this Court for, among others, orders requiring the person to comply with the undertaking, directing the person to pay to the Authority, on behalf of the Commonwealth, a sum up to the amount of any financial benefit reasonably attributable to the breach that the person obtained directly or indirectly and compensation (s 205X(2)).
The explanatory memorandum circulated by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in support of the Bill that became the 2006 amending Act explained the purpose of introducing the civil penalty and enforceable undertaking regime.
This was to complement the use of enforceable undertakings by providing further mid-range enforcement options for the Authority and industry to consider in the event that a breach had been committed.
One express purpose considered in the explanatory memorandum was a perceived deficiency in the Authority's enforcement powers.
The explanatory memorandum said: 
 "For example, the experience of the ACMA in its attempt to prosecute the licensee of commercial radio service 2UE for multiple breaches of the Broadcasting Services (Commercial Radio Current Affairs Disclosure) Standard 2000 indicates some of the difficulties confronted by the ACMA because of its limited enforcement powers.
" 

 The 2006 amendments were intended to address the then lack of middle range penalties to deal with breaches of the Act, regulations and licences by adding to the Act the civil penalty and enforceable undertaking provisions.
Such breaches were ones that did not warrant criminal sanctions, suspension or cancellation of a licence (see EM pars 14, 16).
The explanatory memorandum referred to difficulties associated with criminal sanctions that had been highlighted following the Authority's findings in December 2003 that Radio 2UE had committed 19 breaches of the disclosure standard.
However, later, the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the Authority that on the evidence available there would be no reasonable prospect of a conviction of Radio 2UE in relation to those breaches.
These breaches also involved Mr Laws.
The explanatory memorandum observed that suspension or cancellation of a licence was a severe penalty that affected consumers of the service as well as the broadcaster who could be expected to suffer significant economic loss as a consequence.
It noted that the Authority had never used this power in respect of breaches by commercial broadcasters.
THE DISCLOSURE STANDARD 
 The object of the disclosure standard was stated in cl 3 as being: 
 "... to encourage commercial radio broadcasting licensees to be responsive to the need for a fair and accurate coverage of matters of public interest by requiring the disclosure of commercial agreements that have the potential to affect the content of current affairs programs.
" 

 The disclosure standard applied to all commercial radio broadcasting licensees who broadcast current affairs programs (cl 4).
The standard required, relevantly: The disclosure standard defined a "current affairs program" as a program that had a substantial purpose of providing interviews, analysis, commentary or discussion, including open line discussion with listeners, about current social, economic or political issues (cl 6).
Thus, the standard applied to "talk back radio", where the presenter and callers speak on-air about current topics.
Additionally, the standard provided that a "commercial agreement" meant an agreement, arrangement or understanding: one of the purposes of which was that a presenter in exchange for any benefit or valuable consideration; 
- promoted a third party or its products, or services or interests;
 
- refrained from making negative comments about a sponsor; or 
 
- provided consultancy services in respect of publicity, promotion or public relations; or 
 which imposed obligations on a presenter to provide services in consideration of which the presenter or some service company, other than the licensee, would receive more than $25,000 p.a..
The standard defined "sponsor" to mean a party to a commercial agreement (other than a presenter) as well as the party or parties who were directly to benefit from the promotion or other services provided by the presenter.
For the purpose of these proceedings a critical obligation was contained in cl 7(1).
That provided relevantly that: 
 "(1) ... a licensee must cause to be broadcast during a current affairs program a disclosure announcement at the time of and as part of: 

 
 (a) a broadcast of any material in which the name, products or services of a sponsor are mentioned.
" 

 
The disclosure announcement had to include at least one of the six phrases set out in cl 7(3), such as "[the name of the sponsor] ... is a sponsor of mine".
A licensee had to keep a register of current commercial agreements between sponsors and presenters of current affairs programs (cl 9(1)).
That register had to be available free of charge for public inspection and published on the licensee's website (cl 9(2) and (3)).
The register had to identify details of each commercial arrangement, including specifying the value or benefit to be provided under it as either falling within one of three bands, $10,000 or less p.a., more than $10,000 but not more than a $100,000 p.a.
or more than $100,000 p.a.
(cl 10(5)).
Presenters had to disclose all commercial agreements to their licensee employer (cl 12).
And, cl 13 provided that a licensee had to require each presenter to comply with relevant obligations imposed on the licensee by, among other things, the disclosure standard.
The disclosure standard contemplated that a presenter would be able to earn remuneration directly from a third party.
Generally such a third party would be a person who could have advertised on the presenter's employer's radio station.
The licensee might lose the benefit of advertising revenue while the presenter used its licence to earn remuneration for himself or herself from the sponsor without accounting to his or her employer.
Moreover, unless the commercial agreement were disclosed on-air, listeners may not appreciate the true context for the presenter's reference to his or her sponsor or their product or service, including any apparently favourable treatment.
The disclosure standard was intended to provide for transparency in broadcasting.
One important purpose was to enable a listener to judge whether a presenter's reference to one of his or her sponsors was his or her genuine opinion, or simply something that he or she was being paid to say as if it were their genuine opinion.
It is patent how such a practice could mislead listeners into believing that the references made to sponsors, their products or services or opinions expressed by a presenter, instead of being an advertisement or potentially an advertisement, were the presenter's opinion.
Thus, when a person telephones a talk back radio presenter of a current affairs program and discusses a particular product or service, mentioning a sponsor's name, unless the presenter disclosed that he or she was being sponsored by that entity, the public discussion which would occur between the presenter and the caller would not be transparent.
After all, the presenter could select or pre-arrange for a caller who would mention the sponsor, product or service as part of the presenter's commercial arrangement with the sponsor.
The chairman of the Authority, Chris Chapman, explained its reasons for commencing these proceedings in a media release.
Radio 2UE relied on the media release, its dissemination and its terms as evidence of harm to Radio 2UE's reputation in respect of compliance and of its public denunciation in respect of the 13 contraventions (cf Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21 ; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 284-286 [52] - [59] per McHugh J, 303-304 [123] per Kirby J, 318-319 [177] per Callinan J).
Mr Chapman said: 
 "ACMA has taken the step of applying for civil penalty orders against 2UE, having earlier tried to address 2UE's compliance failures through other means.
These latest breaches occurred at a time when 2UE had given ACMA an enforceable undertaking to improve its performance, particularly in relation to the John Laws Morning Show.... 
 
 However, ACMA ---and the Australian Broadcasting Authority before it--- has emphasised in previous findings against 2UE that the obligation to comply with program standards lies with the licensee itself; in fact it goes to the heart of a licensee's obligations .


 
 Broadcasting licences are not given out lightly by government and convey significant benefit to those to whom a licence is granted .
It is a licensee's unrelenting responsibility to manage its business, including its presenters and production staff, so as to ensure satisfactory compliance with the regulatory requirements.


 
 Company management put at real risk the retention of these licences when they allow on-air personalities or other staff to breach the rules.
One consideration informing the Authority's agreement to consenting to the civil penalty order was its assessment that Fairfax genuinely accepts that proposition.
" (emphasis added) 

 THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF SS 140A AND 205F 
 The grant of the licence is a privilege to use the public resource of the radio spectrum.
Abuse of the privilege, by breaching a condition of a licence, attracts liability under ss 139(3) and 140A(3).
The primary purpose of s 140A(3) is to protect the public by holding licensees to the standard of conduct that their licence requires them to observe.
The disclosure standard addresses a particular, and insidious, means of abusing the privilege of a commercial radio broadcasting licence.
That standard recognised the significant degree of influence current affairs presenters could exert in shaping community views in Australia (see s 4(1)).
The more prominent the presenter, the greater the potential he or she has to exert influence in shaping community views.
The spoken word is the vehicle used to shape views on radio current affairs programs.
The identity of the speaker, if known to the audience, can itself influence their receptivity to what he or she says; as can the speaker's oratorical style and manner of delivery.
And, because of its orality, publication in a radio broadcast conveys a transient message.
The listener may tune in or turn on the radio part way through a program; he or she may have missed an earlier disclosure announcement by the presenter when he or she returns to a topic that attracts an obligation to make such an announcement.
If it is not made, that new listener will not be aware of what the disclosure standard, and the licence, require be conveyed contemporaneously, namely the presenter's sponsorship.
Additionally, listeners may not always be attentive to what is being broadcast on radio and may miss the significance, or indeed the occurrence, of an earlier disclosure statement in the same program.
That can affect the meaning which the listener understands to have been conveyed by what he or she hears the presenter saying later.
These characteristics of transient communications, such as radio or television broadcasts, are also recognised in the common law principles of defamation: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 165G-166E per Hunt CJ at CL, Mason P and Handley JA agreeing.
Thus, the transience both of what is spoken on-air during a radio broadcast and of the listening audience (who may tune in or out at any time and, when tuned in, may pay closer or lesser degrees of attention) underlie the policy behind the disclosure standard's insistence on the presenter making a disclosure announcement contemporaneously each time one of his or her sponsor's name, products or service is mentioned.
The liability in s 140A(3) corresponds to, but is distinct from the criminal liability imposed by s 139(3).
The conduct proscribed by each section is the same, namely a breach of a condition of a licence set out in cl 8(1) of Sch 2, including a breach of the disclosure standard.
But the objects of the two sections are not the same.
One object of s 140A(3) is to create a civil, not criminal, liability so as to enable the Authority to secure compliance with important provisions in the Act more readily than through criminal proceedings.
But another object of the section is to reinforce the norm of conduct for licensees in s 139(3) and to provide a means to enforce their compliance with it less drastic than the remedies existing before 2006.
The Parliament provided that the civil penalty could match the criminal penalty for the same conduct of a commercial radio broadcasting licensee in breaching a condition of its licence.
However, the imposition of a civil penalty under s 140A(3) would not carry the stigma attached to a criminal conviction under s 139(3).
And, pursuant to s 205K of the Act the civil penalty could be imposed after a trial using the civil onus of proof (see too s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)): see too Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 at 477-482 [19] - [38] per Weinberg, Bennett and Rares JJ.
A primary purpose of civil penalties is deterrence: Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 per French J.
Hence, in assessing the penalty to be imposed, a court will consider whether, in all the circumstances relevant to be taken into account (here under s 205F(3)), others would be deterred by the penalty and at the same time the licensee will be penalised or punished appropriately.
The range of relevant matters under s 205F(3) ordinarily will include (borrowing from what French J suggested in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152-52,153): The parties urged that no difference in approach to fixing an agreed civil penalty was called for under the Act as compared to the approach taken under legislation such as under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 42Y of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth).
They relied on what Flick J had said in Secretary, Department of Health and Aging v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1545 at [17] , [23]-[25].
He helpfully reviewed a large number of cases imposing civil penalties arising under a number of Acts: Pagasa [2008] FCA 1545 at [23] - [27] , concluding at [27]: 
 "Although the form of words set forth in other legislative provisions may be the same or comparable to those employed in the 1989 Act, the legislative mandate that the Court " must have regard to all relevant matters " in s 42Y(3) assumes obvious importance.
It is that mandate which directs attention to those more specific matters which can only be discerned from an analysis of the 1989 Act itself.
Of central importance in identifying those matters which are " relevant " --- and which must therefore be taken into account --- are the objects and purposes of the 1989 Act.
" 

 I agree with Flick J's approach to the construction of provisions like s 205F(3) of the Act.
French J remarked in CSR (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152 the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence, namely retribution and rehabilitation, had no "... part to play in economic regulation of the kind contemplated by Pt IV" of the Trade Practices Act .
However, I am of opinion that other considerations arise under the Broadcasting Services Act .
The purpose of regulation under the Act, including the imposition of civil penalties for contraventions of s 140A(3) under s 205F, must be gleaned from the detail of the provisions of the Act.
The common law recognises that its remedy of damages for tort includes, in addition to deterrence, punishment and condemnation of both the actual wrongdoer's behaviour and the behaviour of another for whose conduct the defendant is answerable.
Those objects are, therefore, not exclusively a function of the criminal law.
In Lamb v Cotogno [1987] HCA 47 ; (1987) 164 CLR 1 at 8 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ cited with approval Pratt LCJ's explanation in Wilkes v Wood [1763] EngR 103 ; (1763) Lofft 1 at 19 [98 ER 489 at 498-499] that exemplary damages are awarded "as a punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future and as a proof of the detestation of the jury to the action itself".
