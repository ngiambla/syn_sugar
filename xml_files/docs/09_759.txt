 The applicant in this proceeding challenges an authorisation and determination made by the Board of the Australian Crime Commission ("the Board") under s 7C of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) ("the Act") and two summonses issued by an examiner under s 28 of the Act and served on the applicant.
The applicant's proceeding is brought under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (" Judiciary Act ").
He seeks declarations that the determination and each of the two summonses is invalid.
The Australian Crime Commission ("the Commission") is the first respondent and the examiner, Mr Jeffrey Philip Anderson, is the second respondent.
The facts and grounds of challenge
 The summonses
 In October 2008, the applicant was served with a summons to appear before the Commission.
The summons was issued by the second respondent at 11.26 am on 8 October 2008.
I will refer to this summons as the first summons.
The first summons stated that the Commission was conducting a special investigation pursuant to a determination of the Board, a copy of which was attached to the summons.
The determination of the Board is an eight-page document which is entitled Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Financial Crimes) 2008 .
In these reasons, I will refer to this determination of the Board as the determination.
The first summons stated that the examiner, being satisfied that it was reasonable in all the circumstances to do so, pursuant to s 28(1) of the Act, summoned the applicant to attend at 1.00 am on Tuesday, 21 October 2008 before an examiner at an examination to be held for the purpose of the said special investigation.
A place was then identified and the summons stated that the applicant's attendance was required to give evidence of federally relevant criminal activity involving his knowledge of the federally relevant criminal activities of a named person and two named companies.
The summons stated that the applicant's attendance was required "from day to day unless excused or released from further attendance".
There are obligations in the Act relating to disclosure of certain information.
An examiner may include a notation on a summons that information about the summons or any official matter connected with it not be disclosed.
In this case, the second respondent included such a notation on the first summons.
In those circumstances, he was required, and did, serve with the summons a written statement of rights and obligations under s 29B of the Act.
The written notice which accompanied the first summons set out the rights and obligations under s 29B(1) and (2) and referred to, without setting out, the rights and obligations under s 29B(3).
No reference was made to s 29B(4).
Finally, the first summons referred to the obligations of the person served with the summons set out in s 30 of the Act.
The second respondent prepared written reasons for his decision to issue the summons.
There were some minor redactions of the document put before me.
That was done on the basis of a claim for public interest immunity by the respondents.
In the Reasons document the examiner set out the purpose of the summons and then under the heading "Material Facts" he stated: 
 "I had regard to the following material for the purposes of being satisfied under subsection 28(1A) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) that it was reasonable in all the circumstances to issue the summons:
 (a) A statement of facts and circumstances dated 7 October 2008 and
 (b) Legal submissions dated 7 October 2008.
" 

 
The examiner sets out his conclusions under the heading "Consideration":
 
 "Based upon my consideration of the statement of facts and circumstances and the legal submissions, which are referred to above: 
 I was satisfied that the operation was within the terms of the Determination and that the Determination was still operative.
I was satisfied that it was reasonable in all the circumstances that the Summons be issued to the person to whom it is directed.
I was satisfied that it was reasonable in all the circumstances that the Summons be issued in the terms approved by me.
I was satisfied that the summons does, so far as is reasonably practicable, set out the general nature of the matters in relation to which it is intended to question the person.
I was satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the special ACC operation to which the examination relates, it would prejudice the effectiveness of the special ACC operation for the summons to state beyond that which it does the general nature of the matters in relation to which the examiner intends to question the person.
I was satisfied that this was an appropriate Summons for the inclusion of a notation pursuant to subsection 29A(1) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 , in the terms approved by me, because if such a notation were not included it would reasonably be expected to prejudice the effectiveness of the operation and that a failure to do so might be contrary to the public interest.
"
 The Reasons document identified the return date for the summons as 21 October 2008 at 1.00 pm.
The Statement of Facts and Circumstances document dated 7 October 2008 (referred to in the Reasons document) was tendered, but it is very heavily redacted.
The Legal Submissions document (also referred to in the Reasons document) dated 7 October 2008 was tendered and it is partly redacted.
Again, the redactions were done on the basis of a claim for public interest immunity by the respondents.
The latter document details the history of the determination (and earlier determinations) and the purpose of the special investigation.
As I have said, the first summons required the applicant to attend before an examiner at 1.00 am on Tuesday, 21 October 2008.
The applicant, his counsel, Mr Michael Abbott QC, and his solicitor, Mr Harry Patsouris, attended at the nominated place at that time, but no one was present.
The applicant was served with a second summons.
The second summons was issued by the second respondent at 3.30 pm on 23 October 2008.
It required the applicant to attend at 9.30 am on Monday, 10 November 2008.
The federally relevant criminal activity was described in terms similar to the description in the first summons, save and except that it included activity "involving yourself" and, in addition to the reference to the named person and two named entities, it referred to "and other entities".
Other than the matters to which I have referred, the second summons was in the same terms as the first summons.
Like the first summons, the second summons had the determination and a written statement of rights and obligations attached to it.
The examiner prepared written reasons for his decision to issue the second summons.
There were some differences between the examiner's reasons for issuing the second summons and his reasons for issuing the first summons.
The "federally relevant criminal activity" involved, not only the applicant's knowledge of the activity of others, but also his own activity.
