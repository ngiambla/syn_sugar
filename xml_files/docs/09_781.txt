 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate on 14 November 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs made on 11 April 2008 to refuse to grant a Class BN subclass 136 skilled---independent visa ("the visa") to the appellant.
BACKGROUND 
 The appellant is a non-citizen of Australia and a national of the Philippines.
On 28 March 2006, the appellant's migration agent submitted the appellant's visa application to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ("the Department").
The application, received on 30 March 2006, was for the appellant, his wife and two children to enter Australia on the basis that the appellant was in a skilled occupation and performing the duties of a cook, equivalent to the level of Australian standards for a specified period, in accordance with the requirements in cl 136.213 of Sch 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 ("the Regulations").
A third child was added to the visa application on 31 October 2006.
Clause 136.213 of Sch 2 of the Regulations provides that: 
 "(1) Subject to subclause (2), the applicant has been employed in a skilled occupation: 

 
 (a) if 60 points are specified by an instrument in writing for this paragraph as available for the skilled occupation nominated in the application -- for a period of, or for periods totalling, at least 12 months in the period of 18 months immediately before the day on which the application was made; or 
 
 
 (b) if 40 or 50 points are specified by an instrument in writing for this paragraph as available for the skilled occupation nominated in the application -- for a period of, or for periods totalling, at least 24 months in the period of 36 months immediately before the day on which the application was made.

 
 
 (2) Subclause (1) does not apply to an applicant if: 

 
 ..." 
 
 The appellant claimed that he satisfied cl 136.213(1)(a).
The appellant's visa application stated that he was employed by Woods Place Hotel ("Woods Place") as a Chef Cook from April 1998 to October 2005.
This statement was supported by an undated certificate from the manager of Woods Place certifying that the appellant had been employed by the restaurant as a Chef Cook from 15 April 1998 "up to present" (presumably October 2005).
The appellant lodged a Notification of Changes in Circumstances with the Department on 31 October 2006 stating that the appellant was no longer employed at Woods Place, but was now employed at the Wood Nymph Restaurant ("Wood Nymph").
The appellant's Notice was supported by a certificate of employment from the manager of Wood Nymph which, dated 19 October 2006, was provided to the Department on 27 October 2006.
The certificate of employment certified that the appellant had been employed by Wood Nymph with the designation as Cook from 23 February 2006 up until the date of the certificate.
The appellant's personal particulars for character assessment, also lodged on 31 October 2006, further stated that the appellant had been employed by Woods Place from April 1998 until December 2005 and that he was currently employed by Wood Nymph and had been so employed since February 2006.
On 14 November 2006, an Officer in the Australian Embassy in Manila telephoned the Wood Nymph and spoke with the front desk clerk to investigate the appellant's claims.
The Officer recorded that she was informed that the appellant did not teach or train or plan menus at the restaurant, as had been indicated in the visa application.
The Officer was further informed that the Wood Nymph was previously known as Woods Place (since July 2006).
For the purposes of the Officer's inquiries, the clerk advised that the Officer should contact the restaurant manager.
The manager stated, inter alia, that the appellant had been employed full time as a Cook since February 2006 and that he had been previously employed by the restaurant when it was known as Woods Place.
The manager stated, however, that the appellant's employment at Woods Place was not on a continuing basis and that there were gaps in the appellant's employment record.
The manager was unable to provide the exact date when the appellant commenced employment at Woods Place.
On 27 November 2006, an Officer of the Department wrote to the appellant's migration agent.
The letter stated: 
 "I have received the following information which indicates that an applicant may have provided incorrect information or failed to advise that information has become incorrect (ie.
