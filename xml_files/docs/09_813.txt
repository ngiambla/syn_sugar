Introduction
 The liquidators of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (OPSL) and three related companies, Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (Leveraged Capital), Hawkswood Investments Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (Hawkswood) and Opes Prime Group Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (OPGL) propound a scheme of arrangement between each company and its creditors.
They seek leave under s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to convene meetings of creditors to consider the proposed schemes.
The hearing is usually ex parte.
But this application raised several important issues of principle that were dealt with at a hearing at which a number of creditors, as well as Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), appeared.
What follows are my reasons for permitting the meetings to be held.
OPSL, a stockbroking firm, was a member of the Australian Securities Exchange.
It provided institutional and private clients with a range of stockbroking services, predominately in the form of securities lending and equity financing.
Leveraged Capital also provided securities lending and equity financing services to its clients.
Mostly, they were its employees and employees of OPSL.
A broad outline of securities lending is given in Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 594 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 116.
For present purposes a brief summary will suffice.
Securities lending is the practice by which securities are transferred from one party (the lender) to another party (the borrower), with the borrower contractually obliged to redeliver to the lender at a later time securities which are equivalent in number and type.
The modern securities lending market can be divided into two markets: one that is defined by the motive of the borrower (the "securities driven" market) and the other by the motive of the lender (the "cash driven" market).
In the securities driven market the lender transfers securities to the borrower who must return "equivalent securities" to the lender either on demand or on the occurrence of a defined event.
The borrower: (a) obtains an outright transfer of title to the securities, which may then be sold or on-lent; (b) pays a fee for the use of the securities, calculated by reference to the value of the lent securities; and (c) provides collateral to the lender in the form of cash, other securities or other assets, title to which passes to the lender.
The value of the collateral exceeds the value of the borrowed securities, the difference in percentage terms being referred to as the "margin" (which may need to be "topped up").
At the conclusion of the transaction there is an exchange of "equivalent securities" for "equivalent collateral".
In the event of default, provision is made for placing a money value on each party's obligations, setting one off against the other, and, if there is a net balance, for payment of the balance.
A securities loan in the cash driven market follows the same structure, but there are some important differences.
First, the collateral is always provided in the form of cash.
Second, the amount of cash collateral is less than the value of the lent securities.
Third, the lender pays a fee, much like interest, calculated by using a discounted interest rate.
OPSL and Leveraged Capital entered into "back-to-back" securities lending arrangements with various financiers to obtain the funds needed to finance their clients' share trading.
Under the arrangement, OPSL and Leveraged Capital transferred the securities they had received from their clients to financiers.
The principal financiers were Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) and Merrill Lynch International and Merrill Lynch International (Australia) Limited (collectively Merrill Lynch).
Hawkswood's main function was to act as the investment vehicle for directors of OPSL and OPGL.
The investments included shares in public and private companies, motor vehicles, real estate, and loans to OPSL directors and their related entities.
The remaining corporate plaintiff need be mentioned only briefly.
OPGL is the holding company of the group.
The stock market crashed in late 2007 both in Australia and around the world.
Clients who had lent shares to OPSL and Leveraged Capital were required to "top up" the securities they had lent or return some of the cash they had received.
Most did not do so.
Many wanted to get back their securities and return the cash they had obtained from OPSL or Leveraged Capital.
But, apart from isolated instances, neither OPSL nor Leveraged Capital held the securities they were required to redeliver to their client.
Nor did they have the funds to buy the securities on the open market.
By March 2008 it was clear that the companies in the Opes group were hopelessly insolvent.
So, on 27 March 2008, Messrs Lindholm, Brown and McCluskey of Ferrier Hodgson were appointed joint and several administrators of the companies.
On the same day ANZ appointed Messrs Algeri and Campbell of Deloitte Tohmatsu receivers and managers over the assets and undertakings of the companies pursuant to several debenture charges which were said to secure debts totalling around $650 million.
In due course the creditors of the companies in administration resolved that each company should be wound up.
By virtue of s 499 of the Corporations Act Messrs Lindholm, Brown and McCluskey became the companies' liquidators.
The collapse of the Opes group led to a spate of litigation in the Federal Court, in several State Supreme Courts and in the High Court of Hong Kong.
In most instances the action was brought against an Opes company (usually OPSL, Leveraged Capital or Green Frog Nominees Pty Ltd (in liq) (Green Frog) - the group's nominee company) as well as ANZ or Merrill Lynch.
In each proceeding the plaintiff relies on several causes of action.
At the heart of the claim against the Opes company is the allegation that the client was misled when it "lent" its securities.
Most clients allege they thought they were providing securities under a mortgage arrangement or a margin lending facility.
There are also allegations of breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and mistake.
The liquidators have estimated that the aggregate amount of client claims is approximately $630 million.
As against ANZ and Merrill Lynch, the Opes group's former clients allege the banks received from an Opes company property (the securities) knowing that the transfer was in breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty or constituted a wrongful disposal of the clients' securities.
There are also claims alleging knowing involvement in Opes' misleading conduct.
It is not only the Opes group's former clients that have claims against ANZ and Merrill Lynch.
The liquidators have foreshadowed a claim relating to a transaction that took place a few days before the Opes group was placed into administration.
Pursuant to a "Co-operation Deed" (a) ANZ loaned $95 million to OPGL, OPSL and Leveraged Capital; (b) ANZ released certain securities to OPSL in order for those securities to be re-delivered to a client of Leveraged Capital; (c) an amount of $95 million was retained by ANZ to, in effect, meet a margin call on OPSL; (d) ANZ obtained a fixed and floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of OPGL, OPSL, Leveraged Capital and Hawkswood; (e) various amendments were made to the terms of the securities lending agreements in place between ANZ on the one hand and OPSL and Leveraged Capital on the other hand; (f) ANZ obtained a cross-guarantee and indemnity from OPGL, OPSL and Leveraged Capital and a guarantee and indemnity from Hawkswood and from the directors of OPSL in respect of the $95 million loan; and (g) ANZ obtained a share mortgage from the directors of OPSL.
According to the liquidators this transaction may be an unfair loan under s 588FD , an uncommercial transaction under s 588FB and the floating charges may be void as against the liquidator under s 588FJ.
The liquidators estimate that, if established, the claims would bring in somewhere between $210 million and $275 million.
However, the liquidators have no funds with which to fund an action against ANZ.
They have discussed obtaining funding from a litigation funder, but to date nothing has been agreed.
The liquidators have also foreshadowed a claim against Merrill Lynch arising out of an international prime brokerage agreement made on 26 September 2006 pursuant to which Merrill Lynch was granted a charge over OPSL's assets.
The charge was not registered until 5 October 2007.
On 18 March 2008 the arrangement was "re-papered" and a second charge granted and registered the day following the appointment of administrators.
The charge might be void as against the liquidators under s 588FJ , an unfair preference under s 588FA or an uncommercial transaction under s 588FB and thus liable to be set aside.
If the charge is set aside the liquidators could recover approximately $500 million.
But the claim is not regarded as very strong.
ASIC is also concerned about actions that have been taken by the banks.
In a press release published on 6 March 2009 ASIC announced it had commenced an investigation into whether the arrangements between OPSL and its clients amounted to an unregistered (and therefore illegal) managed investment scheme in which the banks were knowing participants.
The press release also indicated that ASIC was considering the possibility of civil penalty and compensation claims against the directors of OPSL and ANZ respectively for breach of directors' duties.
In the light of the existing and potential claims the liquidators entered into mediation with the banks.
The mediation was protracted but resulted in settlement being reached on 6 March 2009.
The terms of settlement were given effect in an implementation agreement dated 1 May 2009.
The key elements of the implementation agreement follow.
The liquidators agreed to promote schemes of arrangement for each company along the lines of the presently proposed schemes (more of which later).
The banks (ie ANZ and Merrill Lynch) are to contribute $226 million toward a scheme fund, which, together with other money, will under the proposed schemes be distributed between creditors.
Certain assets (to the value of approximately $27 million) presently in the possession of the banks' receivers will be returned to the liquidators.
The banks, receivers, Green Frog and Green Frog's liquidators (and their related parties) will be released from all claims by the Opes companies, their liquidators and Opes clients.
ASIC is to indicate it will not take action against the banks or their officers.
2.
Procedure
 In addition to the usual considerations that arise for determination on an application to convene scheme meetings, there are several other issues concerning the proposed schemes I will consider at this the first of the three-stage process for sanctioning a scheme under s 411.
The three stages are, the application for meetings, the holding of the meetings and, if agreed by the requisite majority, the application for approval.
The issues to be considered are: (a) Do the proposed schemes contain provisions which the court has no jurisdiction to approve; (b) Is more than one meeting of creditors required for each proposed scheme; (c) Is it also necessary to convene a meeting of members; (d) Does a right of appeal exist under s 1321 from a decision concerning a creditor's proof of debt; (e) Are the proposed schemes so unfair they would not be approved even if agreed by the creditors?
; and (f) Should the liquidators be granted leave to act as the scheme administrators?
The traditional practice has been for the court not to address most of these issues at the first stage.
For example, in England the practice note reported in [1934] WN 142 affirmed that it was for the company to decide whether creditors should be divided into classes for voting purposes, taking the risk that the correct decision was made, which would only be discovered at the approval hearing.
In UDL Argos Engineering  Heavy Industries Co Ltd v Li Oi Lin [2001] HKCFA 54 ; [2001] 3 HKLRD 634 Lord Millett, sitting as a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, said this practice was a sound one.
It has been applied to other issues relating to jurisdiction.
In England, however, this view has been overtaken.
The change followed comments by Chadwick LJ in Re Hawk Insurance Co Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 241 ; [2001] 2 BCLC 480.
Chadwick LJ pointed out that the effect of the practice was to require the court when deciding whether to approve a scheme to review the utility of the order it had made convening the scheme meetings.
He went on to say that those propounding the scheme were entitled to feel aggrieved if the court then found its first order to have been pointless.
A new practice statement was published in [2002] 1 WLR 1345.
Under the new practice the applicant for a scheme meeting must draw to the attention of the court as soon as possible any issue that may arise about the constitution of the meetings or which might otherwise affect the conduct of the meetings.
If appropriate, notice must be given to any person affected by the proposed scheme so they may apply to be heard at the convening application.
I adopted this practice in In the Application of United Medical Protection Limited [2007] FCA 631.
The purpose of the new practice is to avoid the waste of costs and court time which would result if it were not until the approval hearing that it was determined that classes were wrongly constituted.
In England it has been said that this underlying purpose means that if other issues which go to the jurisdiction of the court to approve a scheme (as in Re Savoy Hotel Ltd [1981] 1 Ch 351) , or issues which would lead the court unquestionably to refuse the scheme, should also be dealt with at the convening application: Re T  N Ltd (No 3) [2006] EWHC 1447 ; [2007] 1 All ER 851 , 862.
The liquidators appreciated the proposed schemes raised controversial issues.
They brought on a preliminary application asking for directions.
Orders were made for the publication on Ferrier Hodgson's website of the proposed schemes, the draft explanatory statement, the affidavits in support of the applications and the liquidators' outline of argument.
Creditors wishing to make submissions at the convening application were advised to appear on an earlier date which had been set aside to deal with any application for leave to appear.
In the event, several parties sought, and were granted, leave (if leave was necessary) to appear.
They included persons who supported the proposed schemes such as ANZ (for whom Mr Archibald QC with Mr Crutchfield and Ms Neskovcin appeared), Merrill Lynch (for whom Mr Hutley SC with Mr O'Bryan appeared), Green Frog (for whom Mr Elliott SC appeared) and an unsecured creditor, Cedarange Pty Ltd (for whom Mr Zwier appeared).
There were creditors who opposed the proposed schemes or aspects of them.
They were a group of former clients, referred to as the Lavan objectors, who had commenced an action against Opes companies and ANZ (Mr Gleeson SC with Mr Douglas appeared on their behalf); Imobilari Pty Ltd, the plaintiff in a class action (Mr Armstrong appeared on its behalf); a group of more than 80 former clients (for whom Mr Sweeney SC appeared); and a number of other small creditors namely Panopus PLC (represented by Mr Bigmore QC), Danpen Pty Ltd (represented by Mr Wallis) and Mr Mitsius (who appeared unrepresented).
The receivers appeared and were represented by Mr Galvin.
Mr Sifris SC with Mr Boston and Mr Horan appeared for ASIC.
Each party including the plaintiffs, for whom Mr Scerri QC and Mr Strong appeared, was given a fixed time within which to make submissions so as to ensure the hearing would not exceed two days.
Everyone kept to their allotted time.
Special mention should be made of the role played by the liquidators.
The liquidators' obligation is to remain neutral and, usually, the liquidators would not be permitted to appear on this type of application: see the discussion between Lindley LJ and counsel recorded in Re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railway Company [1891] 1 Ch 213 , 233 - 234.
Here however the liquidators' central role in bringing about the implementation agreement which led to the schemes being propounded meant they were best suited to assist the court.
In any event, what would otherwise have been an undesirable position was made good by there being other proponents and opponents of the opposed schemes.
3.
The Proposed Schemes 
 An outline of the proposed schemes is necessary.
The liquidators will become the scheme administrators to realise and distribute assets in accordance with the provisions of the schemes.
This is not to occur on a company by company basis.
Instead, the undertaking, assets and liabilities of each scheme company, other than OPGL, are to be transferred to OPGL, in effect "pooling" the assets and liabilities of the companies (with all inter-company debts and claims to be extinguished).
Included among the assets to be pooled is the $226 million the banks will pay to the liquidators as well as the property that it has been agreed should be returned by the receivers.
The pooled assets (less $11.5 million) will, after payment of the usual costs and expenses, be distributed between the unsecured creditors.
The $11.5 million is to be distributed as follows: (a) $1 million to CLF, a litigation funder who is funding the class action commenced by Imobilari Pty Ltd; (b) $2.5 million to IMF, a litigation funder who is funding several proceedings which have been brought against an Opes company or the banks; and (c) $8 million to be placed in a plaintiffs' costs fund to cover, at least proportionately, the legal costs incurred by Opes clients in other actions brought against Opes companies or the banks.
The unsecured creditors of the Opes companies comprise, loosely speaking, trade creditors and clients or former clients.
A panel of three experts (constituted by one former superior court judge, a senior counsel and a well-known accountant) will rule on any dispute between a creditor and the scheme administrators concerning the existence and value of a creditor's claim.
The schemes will also bind creditors who assert a beneficial interest in certain securities still held by a scheme company.
As nothing turns on their status, when referring to unsecured creditors this group is included.
An essential feature of each scheme is that all unsecured creditors, each scheme company and the liquidators are to release their claims against the banks, Green Frog, the liquidators of Green Frog and the receivers (the released parties).
So far as the creditors are concerned this will be achieved by the execution of a formal deed of release and indemnity by the scheme administrators acting on behalf of each scheme creditor.
The deed contains a covenant that the creditor will not bring or pursue claims against the released parties.
Authority is given to the scheme administrators to take all necessary steps (eg by consenting to orders) to bring to an end any existing action against the banks.
4.
The Third Party Release
 There is a real issue whether a scheme of arrangement can bar a claim against a third party.
The answer depends upon whether a scheme containing such a provision is, within the words of s 411(1) , "a compromise or arrangement .... between a ... [company] and its creditors or any class of them".
Putting the matter this way raises two distinct points: (a) What is meant by a compromise or arrangement (neither being a defined term); and (b) If barring a claim amounts to, or may be an aspect of, either a compromise or an arrangement is it a compromise or arrangement between the company and its creditors?
When considering these points it is necessary to keep in mind that the words "compromise" or "arrangement" must be construed liberally: Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Limited [1993] HCA 15 ; (1993) 177 CLR 485 , 501 citing Re International Harvester Co of Australia Pty Ltd [1953] VLR 669.
It is also necessary to recall that, however widely the expressions "compromise" or "arrangement" are to be construed, there are differences between them.
A compromise involves the resolution of some dispute, for example as to the power to enforce rights or as to what those rights might be: Mercantile Investment  General Trust Company v International Company of Mexico [1893] 1 Ch 491n.
There is no such limitation to an arrangement.
In other words, an arrangement is not something that is analogous to a compromise: Shaw v Royce Limited [1911] 1 Ch 138 , 148; Re Guardian Assurance Company [1917] 1 Ch 431.
What is often said to suffice for an "arrangement" is a transaction that involves some "give and take" or the provision of some "benefit": Re NFU Development Trust Ltd [1972] 1 WLR 1548.
In reality "almost any arrangement otherwise legal which touches and concerns the rights and obligations of the company or its members or creditors may be come to under [s 411]": Re International Harvester [1953] VLR at 672 per Lowe ACJ.
Of course a scheme cannot authorise something which is contrary to law: Re St James' Court Estate Limited [1944] Ch 6.
Nor can a scheme authorise a transaction which is beyond the power of the company ( Re Cooper, Cooper  Johnson, Limited [1902] WN 199; Re Oceanic Steam Navigation Company Limited [1939] 1 Ch 41) , although, nowadays, few acts are ultra vires: see Corporations Act , Pt 2B.1.
There are some limitations on the meaning of "arrangement".
It would not cover a scheme where a creditor abandons all his claims without a compensating advantage, or a scheme which involves the confiscation of rights: Re Alabama at 243 per Bowen LJ (The court will not sanction "what would be a scheme of confiscation"); Re NFU Development Trust (at 1555) per Brightman J ("Confiscation is not my idea of an arrangement.
A member whose rights are expropriated without any compensating advantage is not, in my view, having his rights rearranged in any legitimate sense of that expression"); Isles v The Daily Mail Newspaper Limited [1912] HCA 18 ; (1912) 14 CLR 193 , 197 per Griffith CJ ("Every compromise or arrangement is a bargain, but not every bargain can be fairly described as a compromise or arrangement with creditors --- for instance, a bargain by which creditors would become debtors to the Company instead of creditors").
Mr Gleeson employed the reasoning behind these cases to attack the release clause.
First he said the release amounted to a confiscation of creditors' property, at least as regards those creditors who had claims against the banks, and therefore was not an "arrangement" for the purposes of s 411.
His second submission was that the release could not be binding because a scheme could not bind a creditor in his capacity as a creditor of a third party.
The first submission cannot be accepted.
It assumes that creditors will get nothing for the release.
That is very far from the truth.
When considered from a business point of view, the banks are putting a very large sum of money into the schemes to be rid of claims by the liquidators and the creditors.
True it is the money has not been apportioned between the claims and any attempt to do so would face all sorts of difficulties.
But what I know from the information before me is that a valuer could apportion a not insignificant proportion of the $226 million toward the present and potential claims against the banks.
What is proposed, then, is not a confiscation of property (ie the release of the choses of action) but a true compromise of the claims against the banks.
It is, I suppose, possible to view as a confiscation the manner in which it is proposed to distribute what could be attributed to the compromise of the claims against the banks.
This is for the reason that the whole amount recovered from the banks is to be divided between all the unsecured creditors of the Opes companies whether or not they have claims against the banks.
There is a group, loosely referred to as trade creditors, who do not have claims against the banks.
They are recovering more than they should at the expense of those who do have claims against the banks.
But their proportion of the total amount of unsecured claims is so small (i.e.
0.80%) that it is a misnomer to speak of a confiscation.
The second point raised by Mr Gleeson (whether a scheme under s 411 can release a third party) is a difficult one.
It is made all the more difficult because there are conflicting decisions in point.
It is, therefore, necessary to look at those decisions in some detail.
The only Australian case directly in point is Re Buildmat (Australia) Pty Ltd and the Companies Act (1981) 5 ACLR 689 , an anti-release case.
There the petitioning creditor sought to wind up a company on the ground of insolvency.
The alleged debt was an amount (rent and outgoings) due under a lease.
By the lease the company had covenanted to be jointly and severally liable with the lessee for the payment of money owing under the lease.
The company denied it was liable to pay any rent or outgoings.
It contended that its liability under the lease had been discharged.
It relied upon a scheme of arrangement which the lessee company had entered into with its creditors.
The scheme extinguished creditors' claims against the lessee.
It also contained a provision that creditors who had the benefit of any guarantee or indemnity given to them by any person in respect of the lessee's indebtedness to them should release and discharge the guarantor or indemnifier.
Needham J rejected the company's argument that the scheme released the guarantee.
First of all he said (at 692) that, on the basis of authority (he referred to Hill v Anderson Meat Industries Ltd [1972] 2 NSWLR 704 but the cases go back to at least McGrath v Gray [1874] LR 9 CP 216 (a co-debtor case)) "where a creditor's debt has been discharge by the operation of a scheme of arrangement approved by the court, the approval of the scheme does not affect the right of a creditor bound by the scheme to take proceedings for recovery against the guarantor".
Needham J then held that the release in the scheme did not discharge the guarantee.
His reasoning on the subject is very brief.
He said (at 692): "A scheme of arrangement between a company and its creditors affects those creditors only in the capacity as creditors of the company --- cf Bridges v Hershon [1968] 3 NSWR 47 at 55.
The right of the petitioner against [the company] is not a right in that capacity and it follows that the provisions of the scheme cannot affect it".
The case to which Needham J referred, Bridges v Hershon , should be mentioned because it seems to go against his conclusion.
There a scheme was approved which had as an essential element that certain members of the company would sell their shares to other interested parties.
The court held that the agreement became binding upon the approval of the scheme.
It therefore bound members in their dealings with non-members.
The approach in Re Buildmat has not been followed in other jurisdictions.
Where the point has been considered, the courts have adopted a pro-release approach.
I propose to refer to three cases to which Mr Scerri drew my attention.
The first is Re T  N Ltd (No 3) .
T  N and a number of its related companies (companies that were in administration) for many years engaged in the manufacture of asbestos-containing products.
Many of their employees were exposed to asbestos dust which caused them to suffer certain diseases.
Some had commenced action against the companies.
Others were likely to do so when they suffered symptoms of the diseases, but that might not occur for some time.
T  N and a number of related companies held insurance which they said covered the claims.
For their part, the insurers contended that the policies did not cover asbestos claims.
If they did, the insurers said the policies could be avoided for non-disclosure or misrepresentation.
The T  N companies sued the insurers and were successful.
The insurers then appealed.
Before the hearing of the appeal the claims were settled.
