 Siam Polyethylene Co Limited is a Thai corporation which manufactures linear low density polyethylene in pellets ( the product ).
Depending on the grade, the product can be used to make anything from films and plastic bags to pipes, containers, telephones and other house wares to tanks and drums.
It is used in a variety of extrusion and other moulding applications.
There is one Australian manufacturer of the product, Qenos Pty Limited, and a number of other exporters from overseas which sell the product in the Australian market.
On 3 December 2003, the Minister imposed anti-dumping duties on imports into Australia of the product from Korea (except for one manufacturer there) and from Thailand pursuant to a declaration made under s 269TG(2) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).
Earlier, in 2000, anti-dumping duties and other measures had been taken in respect of importations of the product from Indonesia.
A review of the anti-dumping measures applying to Indonesia, Korea and Thailand began in late 2004 concluding in September 2005 when the variable factors used to assess the incidence of anti-dumping duty for imports of the product from each of those countries were altered.
In July 2005, a continuation enquiry under Div 6 of Pt XVB of the Customs Act resulted in anti-dumping measures being continued in respect of Indonesia for a further five year period.
On 12 November 2007, Qenos lodged an application under s 269ZA of the Act for a review of the anti-dumping measures in respect of the product imported into Australia from Indonesia, Korea and Thailand.
The Chief Executive Officer of Customs, the second respondent, defined as the " CEO " in the Act, advertised his decision to conduct a review in early December 2007.
The CEO published a statement of essential facts in accordance with s 269ZD of the Act on 25 March 2008.
Interested parties had to make submissions in response to the statement of essential facts by mid April 2008 under the strict timetable laid down in the Act under s 269ZDA(1).
On 6 May 2008 the CEO gave the Minister Trade Measures Report 134 containing his recommendations.
That report recommended changes to the variable factors for the assessment of anti-dumping duties which had the effect of raising the previously assessed duty on Siam from nil to a more substantive figure.
On 23 June 2008, the Minister accepted the CEO's recommendations by making a declaration pursuant to s 269ZDB(1) and, on 3 July 2008 his declaration was published.
The Minister's declaration stated that his reasons were those in Report 134.
Siam complained that the decision of the CEO to make the recommendations and the decision of the Minister to accept them were not authorised by the Act.
Siam raised three issues in this application: Did the Minister and CEO misconstrue the provisions of Div 5 of Pt XVB of the Act in the review by failing to apply the test in s 269TG(2)(b) , and so did not inquire whether material injury to Qenos had been or was being caused or threatened by the export to Australia of the product by Siam from Thailand?
Was each of the CEO and the Minister authorised to calculate a non-injurious price, within the meaning of s 269TACA(a) and s 8(5A) of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 (Cth) ( the Dumping Duty Act ) simply by following Customs' ordinary policy of identifying an industry selling price at a time unaffected by dumping, without identifying the injury or threat to the Australian industry (here Qenos) which that price would prevent.
Were the decisions of the CEO, to recommend, and of the Minister, to declare that the anti-dumping measures remain in force with variations made without evidence or other material before either of them that any injury to the Australian industry had been caused by Siam's exports of the product to Australia?
THE STATUTORY SCHEME 
 Division XVB of the Act covers about 150 pages.
It is necessary to summarise some of those provisions for the purposes of explaining enough of the statutory background to enable the issues in these proceedings to be understood.
Following the enactment of the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Act 1994 (Cth) and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping Amendments) Act 1998 (Cth) the purpose of Pt XVB was to give effect to the obligations Australia had assumed under agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Australia is a State party to the Agreement on Implementation of Article IV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ( the implementation agreement ).
The explanatory memorandum circulated by the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs for the 1998 Bill, stated that the, then, present system and the proposed amendments were premised upon conformity with Australia's obligations under the World Trade Organisation Agreements.
Relevantly, Pt XVB contemplated that there will be three significant decisions made at various stages under its provisions.
The first such decision will be whether to impose an anti-dumping measure or not.
If imposed, the measure remains in force for five years unless revoked earlier.
A particular process is set out for the Minister to arrive at that decision which I will describe later.
The second significant decision is whether the initial anti-dumping measure should be changed in consequence of a review during its five year life.
The third significant decision is whether, towards the end of the five year period, there should be a continuation of anti-dumping measures for a further period of five years.
Because the Parliament has enacted Pt XVB to deal with the subject matter of the implementation agreement, the legislation must be interpreted and applied, so far as its language permits, so that it is in conformity, and not in conflict, with Australia's international obligations.
Where the language of a statute is ambiguous, the Court should favour a construction consistent with the international instrument and the obligations which it imposes over another possible construction of that legislation.
The meaning of obligations in an international instrument, such as the implementation agreement, must be ascertained by giving primacy to the text of the instrument as well as considering its context, objects and purposes.
And, an international instrument is interpreted in a more liberal manner than ordinarily when a court construes exclusively domestic legislation: Pilkington (Australia) Ltd v Minister for Justice and Customs [2002] FCAFC 423 ; (2002) 127 FCR 92 at 100 [25] - [26] per Mansfield, Conti and Allsop JJ.
International treaties should be interpreted uniformly by States party: LK v Director General, Department of Community Services (2009) 253 ALR 202 at 213 [36] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ.
The starting point for the process of construction of the Act, is found in the words that the Parliament has chosen.
The terms of the implementation agreement, or other international convention, are an aid to construction of domestic legislation enacted by the Parliament: see Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 142 ; (2008) 170 FCR 560 at 568-570 [32] - [41] per French, Rares and Besanko JJ.
CONTEXT OF THE PRESENT APPLICATION IS A REVIEW OF EXISTING ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 
 Relevantly, in December 2003, the Minister decided to make a declaration of anti-dumping measures and to cause publication of a notice of its making under s 269TG(2) which provides: 
"(2) Where the Minister is satisfied, as to goods of any kind, that:
 
 
 
(a) the amount of the export price of like goods that have already been exported to Australia is less than the amount of the normal value of those goods, and the amount of the export price of like goods that may be exported to Australia in the future may be less than the normal value of the goods; and 
 
 
(b) because of that, material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or is threatened , or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered;
 
 
the Minister may, by public notice (whether or not he or she has made, or proposes to make, a declaration under subsection (1) in respect of like goods that have been exported to Australia), declare that section 8 of the Dumping Duty Act applies to like goods that are exported to Australia after the date of publication of the notice or such later date as is specified in the notice.
" (emphasis added)
 
 The " export price " was defined in s 269TAB(1)(a) as being the price paid or payable by the importer into Australia in an arms length transaction with an exporter.
Here, Siam sold to Dow Chemical (Australia) Limited at arms length.
Section 269TAB(1) provided that the export price excluded any part of the price representing a charge in respect of the transport of the goods after exportation or in respect of any other matter arising after exportation.
The " normal value of the goods " was defined in s 269TAC(1) as the price paid or payable for like goods sold in the ordinary course of trade for home consumption in the country of export in sales that are arms length transactions made by the exporter.
The CEO was able to ascertain the normal value of the product sold by Siam in Thailand.
Thus, where the Minister is satisfied under s 269TG(2)(a) that a price broadly equivalent to the f.o.b.
(free on board) price for the goods exported to Australia is less than the price for which the same goods would have been sold in Thailand, the sale to Australia is regarded as being at a "dumped" price.
Here, there is no dispute that the CEO and the Minister were entitled to be satisfied that Siam exported the product to Australia at a dumped price.
The second condition in s 269TG(2)(b) required that the dumped price be causative of "material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods" in the sense that such an injury had either been occasioned, was currently caused or was being threatened.
Here, the relevant Australian industry was Qenos, the only Australian manufacturer.
The concept of " material injury " under Div 3 was dealt within s 269TAE.
That provided that for the purposes of s 269TG in determining whether material injury has been, is being caused or is threatened because of any circumstance in relation to the exportation of goods to Australia from the country of export, the Minister "may, without limiting the generality of that section but subject to subsections (2A), (2B) and (2C), have regard to" a range of factors including: Next, s 269TAE(2A) provided that in making a determination in relation to the exportation of goods to Australia "the Minister must consider whether any injury to an industry ... is being caused or threatened by a factor other than the exportation of those goods" and any such injury or hindrance must not be attributed to the exportation of those goods.
The section then listed a number of examples of the factors which the Minister must not attribute to the dumping, including the volume and prices of imported like goods that are not being dumped, contractions in demand or changes in patterns of consumption, restrictive trade practices of, and competition between, foreign and Australian producers of like goods, developments in technology, export performance and productivity of the Australian industry.
This list of factors was not intended to be exhaustive or a set of factors necessarily to be taken into account.
The critical question, for the purposes of s 269TAE(2A), for the Minister to consider was whether the injury was being caused or threatened by a factor other than the exportation of the dumped goods.
Next, section 269TAE(2B) provided: 
"(2B) In determining:
 
 
 
(a) for the purposes of subsection (1), whether or not material injury is threatened to an Australian industry; or
 
 
(b) for the purposes of subsection (2), whether or not material injury is threatened to an industry in a third country;
 
 
because of the exportation of goods into the Australian market, the Minister must take account only of such changes in circumstances , including changes of a kind determined by the Minister, as would make that injury foreseeable and imminent unless dumping or countervailing measures were imposed .
" (emphasis added)
 
 It follows that, ss 269TAE(1) and (2B) together applied when the Minister had to determine, for the purposes of making a decision under s 269TG, whether material injury to an Australian industry had been or was being caused or was threatened, or would or might have been caused, because of any circumstances in relation to the dumping of goods here.
In that situation, s 269TAE(2B) required the Minister to take account only of such changes in circumstances as would make that injury both foreseeable and imminent unless anti-dumping measures were imposed.
These provisions sought to give effect to Art 3.7 of the implementation agreement which stated: 
"3.7 A determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility .
The change in circumstances which would create a situation in which the dumping would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent .
(One example, though not an exclusive one, is that there is convincing reason to believe that there will be, in the near future, substantially increased importation of the product at dumped prices.
) In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, the authorities should consider, inter alia , such factors as:
 
 
(i) a significant rate of increase of dumped imports into the domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially increased importation;
 
 
 (ii) sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of the exporter indicating the likelihood of substantially increased dumped exports to the importing Member's market, taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any additional exports;
 
 (iii) whether imports are entering at prices that will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices, and would likely increase demand for further imports; and
 
 (iv) inventories of the product being investigated.


No one of these factors by itself can necessarily give decisive guidance but the totality of the factors considered must lead to the conclusion that further dumped exports are imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur.
" (emphasis added)
 
 
And Art 3.8 provided that in a case where injury was threatened by dumped imports "... the application of anti-dumping measures shall be considered and decided with special care".
The Dumping Duty Act provided that the Customs Act was incorporated and must be read as one with it (s 6).
Significantly, s 8(2)(a) expressly provided that dumping duty "is imposed, and ... must be collected and paid, on goods ... to which this section applies by virtue of a notice under subsection 269TG(1) or (2) of the Customs Act ".
Dumping duty payable on goods the subject of a notice under s 269TG(2) of the Customs Act was fixed by ss 8(2) and 8(6)(a) of the Dumping Duty Act as the difference between the amounts that the Minister ascertained to be the export price and the normal value of those particular goods.
Interim dumping duty was levied by ss 8(3) and (4) of the Dumping Duty Act pending final assessment of the dumping duty payable, as the difference between the export price and normal value of the goods as ascertained or last ascertained by the Minister for the purpose of the notice.
Prices and values were ascertained for the purpose of a notice in accordance with the provisions of Div 5 of Pt XVB of the Customs Act .
Those provisions also permitted review of the operation of a notice during its currency.
The Minister had to direct, by a signed notice, that the amount of interim dumping duty be ascertained as a proportion of the export price of the particular goods or goods of that kind as ascertained or last ascertained by the Minister for the purpose of the dumping duty notice, whichever is the greater: s 8(5) of the Dumping Duty Act.
And, s 8(5A) provided that the Minister must, if the non-injurious price of goods of the kind ascertained, or last ascertained, by him or her for the purpose of the notice was less than the normal value of the goods of that kind, have regard to the desirability of fixing a lesser amount of duty so that the sum of the export price of the goods of the kind as ascertained or last ascertained and that lesser duty did not exceed the non-injurious price.
In other words, the mechanism for fixing an interim duty of this kind required the Minister to ascertain what would be the non-injurious price and to have regard to the desirability of imposing a duty which did not exceed it.
The concept of a " non injurious price " was defined in s 269TACA(a) as: 
"The non-injurious price of goods exported to Australia is the minimum price necessary :
 
 
(a) if the goods are the subject of, or of an application for, a dumping duty notice under subsection 269TG(1) or (2)--- to prevent the injury, or a recurrence of the injury , or to remove the hindrance, referred to in paragraph 269TG (1)(b) or (2)(b) ;" (emphasis added)
 
 
Thus, the non-injurious price was the price "necessary" to prevent the injury or a recurrence of the injury referred to in s 269TG(2)(b).
The standard in s 269TACA(a) is an objective one.
So, the Minister must first identify the material injury to the Australian industry producing the like goods that has been, is being caused or threatened by the dumping.
Next, the Minister must determine a price at which the dumped goods are to be sold that will prevent the actual or threatened injury to the Australian industry.
This reflects the important provisions of Art 3.1 of the implementation agreement.
That provided that a determination of injury:
 
 "... shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of both 
 
 
(a) the volume of the dumped imports and the effect of the dumped imports on prices in the domestic market for like products, and
 
 
(b) the consequent impact of those imports on domestic producers of such products".
(emphasis added)
 
 Under s 269TG(3)(b) a notice issued under s 269TG(2) must include a statement of the respective amounts that the Minister ascertained, at the time of publication of the notice, was or would be the normal value of the goods to which the declaration relates, the export price of those goods and their non-injurious price.
However, s 269TG(3A) permits the Minister to retain the confidentiality of commercial and valuable information as to those prices by not making them part of a public notice (see Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister for Home Affairs (No 3) [2009] FCA 839].
Nonetheless, the scheme of s 269TG(3A) is clear: it requires the Minister to ascertain the normal value, export price and non-injurious price for the purposes of the declaration and the consequent imposition of anti-dumping duties under the Dumping Duty Act .
Where a notice under s 269TG(2) has been published by the Minister, the notice expires five years after the day of publication unless it is revoked before the end of that period: s 269TM(1).
REVIEW OF ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 
 Under Div 5 of Pt XVB of the Act, persons affected by anti-dumping measures, such as an anti-dumping notice, can apply for a review and the Minister can initiate, of his or her own motion, a review within the five year currency.
An affected party may lodge an application pursuant to s 269ZA(1) requesting the CEO to initiate a review of anti-dumping measures that have been taken in respect of goods where the affected party considers that it may be appropriate to review those measures as they affect either a particular exporter of the goods or exporters generally.
However, s 269ZA(1) required the applicant for a review to identify at least one of two bases for the review.
These were, first, that there had been a change of one or more variable factors relevant to that importer or manufacturer or the current situation is such that if there were no anti-dumping measures then in place, the Minister would not be entitled (at the time of the request) to take such measures.
Thus, an importer or affected Australian manufacturer can apply for a review.
However, an application for review cannot be made until 12 months after the publication of the notice or 12 months after the last review (s 269ZA(2)).
Next, s 269ZB prescribed the content of an application for review which must be in an approved form (s 269ZB(1)).
Where the application for a review is based on a change in variable factors, the applicant must provide a statement of its opinion concerning the relevant variable factors that have changed, the amount by which each factor has changed and the information that establishes that amount (s 269ZB(2)(c)).
Where the application for a review is based on any other circumstances that in the view of the applicant would prevent the Minister, in the absence of anti-dumping measures, from taking such measures, the applicant must provide a statement of those other circumstances (s 269ZB(2)(d)).
The CEO must examine the application for review within 20 days after Customs receives it (s 269ZC(1)) and must, either, reject the application, if not satisfied of the matters referred to in s 269ZC(2), or commence the review.
The matters which the CEO is required to consider under s 269ZC(2) are whether the application complied with the formal requirements of s 269ZB and, pursuant to s 269ZC(2)(b): 
"(b) whether there appear to be reasonable grounds for asserting either:
 
 
(i) that the variable factors relevant to the taking of anti-dumping measures have changed; or
 
 
(ii) that, if the anti-dumping measures to which the application relates had not been taken, the Minister would not be entitled to take such measures.
"
 
 When the CEO has decided not to reject an application for review of anti-dumping measures, the CEO must publish a notice in a newspaper circulating in each State and Territory indicating the proposal to conduct the review.
Then s 269ZC(7) set out a timetable that required, in effect, that a report will be made to the Minister within either 110 or 155 days.
Once a notice of review has been published, the CEO must place on the public record a statement of facts upon which the CEO proposes to base a recommendation to the Minister in relation to the review of those measures, which was called a " statement of essential facts " (s 269ZD(1)).
In formulating the statement of essential facts s 269ZD(2) required the CEO to have regard to the application or request and any submissions relating generally to the review received by Customs within 40 days after the publication of the public notice, and may have regard to any other matters that the CEO considered relevant.
The CEO must then prepare a report pursuant to s 269ZDA(1)(a) which provided as follows: 
(1) The CEO must, after conducting a review of anti-dumping measures and before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 269ZC(7)(c) as it applies to those measures, give the Minister a report recommending:
 
 
(a) to the extent that the measures involved the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice:
 
 
(i) that the notice remain unaltered; or
 
 
 (ii) that the notice be revoked in its application to a particular exporter or to a particular kind of goods or revoked generally; or
 

(iii) that the notice have effect in relation to a particular exporter or to exporters generally, as if different variable factors had been ascertained;"
 
 For present purposes it is important to recognise that the provisions of s 269ZDA(1)(a) required the CEO to recommend to the Minister one of three specified choices.
The CEO was required, in deciding on the recommendations to be made to the Minister in the report, to have regard to the application or request for review, any submission relating generally to the review to which the CEO has had regard for the purpose of formulating the statement of essential facts, the statement itself, and any submission made in response to that statement received by Customs, within 20 days after it had been placed on the public record, together with any other matter that the CEO considered to be relevant pursuant to s 269ZDA(3).
In addition, the CEO is required by s 269TE(2) to determine any such recommendation in the same manner, and having regard to the same considerations, as if he or she were the Minister.
The report to the Minister must include a statement of the CEO's reasons for any recommendation contained in it, set out the material findings of fact upon which the recommendation was based and provide particulars of the evidence relied on to support those findings (s 269ZDA(5)).
The Minister then makes the decision under s 269ZDB(1), which provided relevantly as follows: 
"(1) After considering the report of the CEO and any other information that the Minister considers relevant, the Minister must declare, by notice published in accordance with subsection (7), that for the purposes of this Act and the Dumping Duty Act:
 
 
 
(a) to the extent that the anti-dumping measures concerned involved the publication of a dumping duty notice or a countervailing duty notice:
 
 
 
(i) that the notice is to remain unaltered; or
 
 
 (ii) that, with effect from a date specified in the declaration, the notice is taken to be, or to have been, revoked either in relation to a particular exporter or to exporters generally or in relation to a particular kind of goods; or
 

(iii) that, with effect from a date specified in the declaration, the notice is to be taken to have effect or to have had effect, either in relation to a particular exporter or to exporters generally, as if the Minister had fixed different variable factors in respect of that exporter or of exporters generally, relevant to the determination of duty;"
 
 A declaration made by the Minister under s 269ZDB(1) took effect according to its terms.
The choices offered to the Minister reflected the three classes of recommendation which the CEO had to provide to him or her in the report under s 269ZDA(1)(a).
The critical question for present purposes is whether the criteria specified in Div 3 of Pt XVB of the Act for the initial imposition of anti-dumping measures affected or controlled the considerations arising in a review under Div 5 of Pt XVB.
It is apparent that the statutory language providing for the initial decision is different to that for a review.
A declaration made by the Minister under s 269ZDB(1)(a) has consequences for the purposes of the Customs Act and the Dumping Duty Act .
The declaration can either leave the notice issued earlier under s 269TG(2) unaltered, or revoke it, either generally or with respect to a particular exporter or exporters or to particular kinds of goods.
That is, under the first two alternatives in s 269ZDB(1)(a), the Minister's declaration will operate on the existing notice by leaving it in place or wholly or partly revoking it.
The third alternative deems an existing notice prospectively to have a different effect as provided for in the Minister's declaration.
Critically, the outcome of the declaration is always determined by reference to the notice in force pursuant to s 269TG(2).
In arriving at his or her decision to make a declaration under s 269ZDB(1) the Minister considers the report of the CEO "...and any other information that the Minister considers relevant".
The word "information" is not defined or otherwise supplemented in the Act.
Obviously, the Minister will have before him or her the original dumping duty notice, because that is the instrument which the Minister's declaration will affect in one of the three manners allowed by the section.
Because s 269ZDB(1)(a)(iii) gives the Minister power to change the operation of the original notice so that, from the date specified in the declaration it will have effect "as if" the Minister had fixed the relevant different variable factors in respect of an exporter or exporters generally, he must have rejected the other two alternatives (being to leave the earlier notice unaltered or to revoke it wholly or partly).
Thus, the Minister's function was to make a declaration after considering the CEO's report and any other information he or she considers relevant.
That is in contrast to the function of the CEO under s 269ZDA(3) who must make any recommendations having regard to, first, the four specified factors in s 269ZDA(3)(a) but, secondly, pursuant to s 269TE(2), the considerations to which the Minister would be required to have regard and to determine the matter in like manner as if the CEO were the Minister.
THE REVIEW 
 Report 134 recorded that Customs had reviewed all the variable factors in the 12 months between 1 October 2006 and 30 September 2007 and "... considered whether there were any grounds to revoke the measures".
During the review period the rate of duty for imports of the product from Thailand was free, in contrast to the 5% duty on imports from Indonesia and Korea.
In February 2008, Customs visited Siam in Thailand and obtained information which it used to verify its findings.
Report 134 found: Customs also visited a number of other exporters of the product affected by the review and analysed various items of confidential information it obtained from them and Qenos as to their businesses as well as their costs and prices.
Customs then prepared confidential appendices to Report 134.
I have given separate reasons for confidentiality orders that I made during the hearing in respect of this class of information: Siam Polyethylene Co Ltd v Minister of State for Home Affairs (No 3) [2009] FCA 389.
Customs found that all relevant information it had considered during the review indicated that prices and costs had increased since the last review.
The evidence in the confidential evidence indicated that those increases were significant and substantial.
Report 134 then discussed the issues arising for the Minister in considering whether, under s 8(5A) of the Dumping Duty Act , it might be desirable to fix a lesser amount of duty so that the export price and the lesser amount of duty together did not exceed the non-injurious price.
It described Customs' practice in this regard as first establishing an unsuppressed selling price.
In order to calculate the unsuppressed selling price for Report 134, Customs used the industry's selling price at a time unaffected by dumping.
However, this was a different methodology to that used in the original determination and earlier reviews.
The earlier method used a constructed industry price based on the industry's cost to make and sell the product plus a rate of profit achieved on sales of a similar product, also ethylene based.
