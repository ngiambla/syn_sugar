 Fundamental Issues
 Section 90 of the Australian Constitution reserves to the Australian Parliament the exclusive powers to impose duties of customs and of excise.
The exclusivity of the power prevents not only the States but each of the two inland Territories from imposing a duty of excise ( Capital Duplicators Pty Ltd v Australian Capital Territory [No 1] [1992] HCA 51 ; (1992) 177 CLR 248).
This case concerns allegations that the second respondent ("the ACT") invalidly imposed duties of excise on the first respondent ("ACTEW") which were to be passed on to the applicant ("QCC").
QCC obtains water from ACTEW and supplies it to businesses and residents in and around Queanbeyan, a small city in New South Wales close to the border between New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.
QCC is established under the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW).
The ACT was established as a body politic under the Crown by s 7 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth).
The Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory has powers to make laws (s 22).
The Australian Capital Territory Executive has the responsibility of governing the Australian Capital Territory with respect to an extensive list of matters including water resources and taxation (s 36 and Sch 4).
ACTEW is a statutory corporation owned by the ACT.
ACTEW was established under the Territory-Owned Corporations Act 1990 (ACT).
Its voting shareholders are Ministers appointed by the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory.
The voting shareholders retain an ultimate power of direction and may require ACTEW to act contrary to the wishes and decisions of its own board of directors, although there is no suggestion that such a power has been exercised with respect to any of the issues which arise for consideration in the present case.
Amongst ACTEW's functions is the supply of water to residents and businesses within the Australian Capital Territory and to Queanbeyan.
ACTEW charges QCC for water pursuant to a set of principles agreed between it and QCC which are based in part upon the premise that ACTEW will recover from QCC its costs of supplying water to QCC.
Commencing on 1 January 2000 the ACT began to impose a charge on ACTEW it called a water abstraction charge ("the WAC").
The charge commenced at the level of 10 cents per kilolitre and rose over a period of time to 55 cents per kilolitre.
Various reasons were advanced from time to time for its existence and level which will be discussed in due course.
Owing to a change in the basis of the charge, from a charge upon water actually delivered by ACTEW to its customers to a charge upon water abstracted by ACTEW, the current level of the charge is 51 cents per kilolitre of water delivered rather than 55 cents per kilolitre of water taken.
The change was said to be revenue neutral owing to the fact that there was always some loss between abstraction and delivery.
Commencing on 1 January 2007 the ACT also imposed upon ACTEW, and others, a liability to pay a utilities (network facilities) tax ("the UNFT").
The tax was charged upon various networks which were distributing water, electricity, gas, sewerage and telecommunications.
The charge applies to ACTEW's infrastructure for the delivery of water to its customers.
It is a charge imposed by reference to the length of the network route.
Both the WAC and the UNFT were "passed through" from ACTEW to QCC.
They were shown as separate amounts in invoices rendered to QCC by ACTEW and were in addition to the recovery of other water supply costs.
QCC refused to pay the UNFT and has not paid the WAC since 30 June 2007.
It is now seeking to recover the amounts of WAC paid since 1 January 2004 when the level of the WAC was raised from 10 cents per kilolitre to 20 cents per kilolitre.
QCC claims that both the WAC (above 10 cents per kilolitre) and the UNFT are duties of excise which may not be levied by the ACT.
The fundamental question in the present proceedings is whether those contentions are correct having regard to the characteristics of the charges in question.
That fundamental question turns, in the first instance, on whether each of the WAC and the UNFT is properly characterised as a tax.
The respondents deny that either of the WAC or the UNFT is a tax, notwithstanding the legislative characterisation by the ACT itself of the UNFT as a tax.
If either the WAC or the UNFT is a tax the next question to be determined is whether it is a tax on a step in production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods.
If so, it is duty of excise (see Ha v New South Wales [1997] HCA 34 ; (1997) 189 CLR 465 ( "Ha" ).
Introductory matters
 Under s 13 of the Water Resources Act 1998 (ACT) ("the 1998 WR Act"), since repealed, the rights to the "use, flow and control" of all water of the Australian Capital Territory were, subject to an exception not here relevant, "vested in" the ACT.
Those rights were exercisable by the responsible Minister (see also Legislation Act 2001 (ACT) s 162(2)).
Section 7 of the Water Resources Act 2007 (ACT) ("the 2007 WR Act") now makes similar provision.
ACTEW possesses various licences authorising it to provide water services and sewerage services and to take water from various places for the purposes of urban water supply.
All of the water abstracted by ACTEW lies or flows in areas under the direct control of the ACT.
The ACT controls two water catchment areas, one in the Australian Capital Territory, known as the Cotter Catchment, and one in New South Wales.
The New South Wales catchment is the Googong Dam Area which was acquired by the Commonwealth in October 1973 for the purpose of the provision of facilities for the storage of water and its supply for use in the Australian Capital Territory.
The Canberra Water Supply (Googong Dam) Act 1974 (Cth)) vested the rights to use and dispose of all waters in the Googong Dam Area in Australia but gave the ACT Executive the power to exercise such rights (s 11(2)).
Recently the ACT has been granted a 150 year lease by the Commonwealth over the Googong Dam Area.
Water is also taken from the Murrumbidgee River within the Australian Capital Territory.
The Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission for the Australian Capital Territory ("the ICRC") was established under the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission Act 1997 (ACT).
The ICRC's functions include the provision of price directions and recommendations about price regulation (s 8).
The responsible Minister may provide a reference to the ICRC in relation to prices for regulated services (s 15).
On 29 June 2001 the ICRC, which also has functions under the Utilities Act 2000 (ACT) ("the Utilities Act "), granted ACTEW a license to provide water services and sewerage services.
ACTEW was also granted a licence under s 35 of the 1998 WR Act to take water for the purpose of urban water supply.
On 21 February 2008 ACTEW was granted a licence under the 2007 WR Act to take water for the purpose of urban water supply.
Various agreements have historically dealt with the supply of water from ACTEW to QCC.
Some were called "service level" agreements.
The most recent was made on 8 January 2002.
It included some basic pricing principles.
Schedule 8 set out the agreed pricing principles.
