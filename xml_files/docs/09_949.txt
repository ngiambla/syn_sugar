 INTRODUCTION 
 The first applicant, Medrad Inc, is the registered owner of Australian Patent No 2005200597, entitled "Improvements relating to medical injector systems".
This is the patent in suit.
The earliest priority date claimed for the patent is 10 July 2000.
The invention is concerned with aspects of a medical injector system for injecting fluid from a syringe into a patient.
An aspect of the invention disclosed in the patent relates to the syringes, including associated hubs and seals, used in the injector system.
The second applicant, Imaxeon Pty Ltd, claims to be the exclusive licensee of the patent in suit.
The applicants seek an interlocutory injunction in order to prevent the respondent, Alpine Medical Pty Ltd, from selling or offering for sale syringes, including hubs and seals sold with them, allegedly having features falling within claims of the patent.
In particular, the applicants seek an interlocutory injunction against the respondent in respect of the following syringes: 
(a) syringes entitled "High Pressure Syringe" with product numbers 100104, 100102 and 500102; 
 
(b) syringes the subject of ARTG entry no 158824 that:
 
(1) include or incorporate any hub for syringes as claimed in claim 1 and/or claim 4 of the patent; or 
 
(2) include or incorporate any hub and seal combination systems for syringes as claimed in claim 9 and/or claim 12 of the patent; and/or
 
(3) are for use with a medical injector system as claimed in claims 51 and 52 of the patent;
 
(c) syringes manufactured by Shenzhen Ant Medical Devices Co Ltd, Shenzhen City, People's Republic of China that: 
 
(1) include or incorporate either any hubs for syringes as claimed in claim 1 and/or claim 4 of the patent; or
 
(2) include or incorporate any hub and seal combination systems for syringes as claimed in claim 9 and/or claim 12 of the patent; and/or
 
(3) are for use with a medical injector system as claimed in claims 51 and 52 of the patent.
In an amended statement of claim filed 30 July 2009, the applicants allege that each of these products contain an essential integer of claims 1, 9, 51 and 52 of the patent in suit and that, by selling these products or offering them for sale, the respondent has infringed claims 1, 9, 51 and 52 of the patent.
At the hearing of the application for interlocutory relief, the applicants applied to amend their statement of claim, in order to add the further or alternative allegation that the respondent's products contain an essential integer of claims 4 and 12 of the patent, and that, by selling these products or offering them for sale, the respondent has infringed claims 4 and 12 of the patent.
The respondent opposed the amendment, but, for the reasons stated below, I would grant the applicants the leave they sought.
This application is determined on this basis.
In support of their claim for relief, the applicants rely on two affidavits of Alwyn William Reynolds sworn on 30 July and 18 August 2009, two affidavits of Victor Chang Ting Tse sworn on 30 July and 18 August 2009, an affidavit of Timothy James Hands sworn on 18 August 2009, and an affidavit of Wayne McMaster also sworn on 18 August 2009.
The respondent filed its defence on 19 August 2009, which: (1) denied the alleged infringements in respect of syringes with product numbers 100102 and 100104 (i.e, the Stellant substitute syringes) upon the basis that they do not contain the integers of the claims as alleged; (2) accepted that syringes with product number 500102 (i.e, the Klikfit substitute syringe) have the alleged features; and (3) asserted that claims 1, 9, 51 and 52 of the patent are invalid "as those claims do not define a patentable invention for the reason that the invention, as claimed in claims 1, 9, 51 and 52 of the patent, is obvious having regard to common general knowledge at the earliest priority date for each of those claims".
The respondent indicated in argument that, in so far as necessary, its challenge to invalidity on the ground of obviousness should be understood to extend to the invention as claimed in claims 4 and 12.
In opposition to the relief sought, the respondent relied on an affidavit of Susan Terry Evans sworn on 14 August 2009 and an affidavit of Frank Papamichalakis (known also as Frank Pappas) also sworn on 14 August 2009.
BACKGROUND 
 In his 30 July 2009 affidavit, Mr Reynolds, the Managing Director of Imaxeon, deposed that Imaxeon is a wholly owned subsidiary of Medrad.
Mr Reynolds described Medrad as "a worldwide, market-leading manufacturer and distributor of high technology medical devices".
Mr Reynolds stated that "Medrad has a worldwide reputation for performance that helps physicians diagnose patients more accurately and, ultimately, deliver quality patient care".
Mr Reynolds noted that Medrad is also the registered owner of two Australian trade marks in Australia, both of which are exclusively used in Australia by Imaxeon.
These trade marks are "KLIKFIT" and "VISIMAX".
Turning to Imaxeon, Mr Reynolds said that "Imaxeon designs, manufactures, imports, exports, distributes and supplies contrast injection systems for computer tomography (" CT ") and cardiovascular (" CV ") applications, as well as all associated consumables".
Imaxeon has been Medrad's sole distributor in Australia since 2000.
According to Mr Reynolds, the main focus of its business is CT contrast injection systems and the sale of consumables for injection systems.
Imaxeon's customers are typically hospitals and radiology clinics.
This proceeding involves the sale by the respondent of syringes (including their hub and seal components) for use as part of CT contrast injector systems supplied by the applicants for use in CT imaging.
Injector systems are used for injecting contrast dyes intravenously into patients.
Mr Reynolds deposed that CT imaging frequently involves injecting intravenous contrast dye materials into patients, in order to enhance the images obtained from a CT scan by highlighting structures such as blood vessels and soft organs that would otherwise be difficult to delineate from their surroundings.
According to Mr Reynolds, an injector system consists of: 
(a) a programmable and processor-controlled injector unit that automatically regulates the rate at which the contrast dye materials are injected into the patient;
 
(b) a specifically designed disposable contrast injector syringe that fits into the injector unit to deliver the contrast dye material and is automatically operated by the injector unit according to pre-set parameters; and
 
(c) tubing that extends from the contrast injector syringe to the intravenous cannula connected to the patient.
Once the injector unit has been programmed, it automatically controls the piston of the contrast injector, which pushes the hub and seal within the syringe barrel to deliver the contrast dye materials for the patient.
Mr Reynolds deposed that the software algorithms installed on the computer processor within the injector unit regulate the rate of injection of the contrast material into the patient.
The algorithms are designed to take into account the technical features of the relevant contrast injector syringe that are specific to that injector system.
Mr Reynolds stated that "the syringe is an integrated component of the entire system, the characteristics of which are important to the accurate and safe operation of the system".
He also stated that "[i]t is for this reason that a contrast injector system uses only the syringes that are specifically designed for that particular injector system".
