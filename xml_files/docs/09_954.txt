 These proceedings were commenced by an application filed 24 July 2009.
An amended application was filed on 29 July 2009.
The amended application detailed the applicant's claim as one for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, findings of fact for the purposes of section 83 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') and costs.
In addition, the amended application included a claim for interlocutory relief.
On 30 July 2009 the duty judge granted interlocutory injunctive relief, including mandatory injunctive relief, until further order.
The matter was before the Court for first directions referable to the ultimate hearing, on 17 August 2009.
On that day the Court was informed that the respondents consented to the final relief sought.
However, it was indicated that it would be necessary for the Court to consider the evidence by reference to which the applicant sought the declaratory relief, so that it might be persuaded to make the declarations sought.
The matter was listed for final hearing on 20 August 2009.
When the matter was called for hearing today, Senior Counsel for the applicant handed up proposed orders which, in paragraphs numbered 1 - 8 inclusive, sought the same relief as was set out in paragraphs 1 - 7 of the Amended Application filed 29 July 2009, but split the injunctive relief sought in paragraph 3 into two paragraphs which became paragraphs 3 and 4 in the draft orders.
The draft orders did not propose any relief under s 83 of the Act.
They did, however, include a proposed order that the respondents pay the applicant's costs in an amount to be agreed or, in lieu of agreement, as taxed.
Such an order was not opposed by the respondents.
In relation to the proposed injunctive relief s 80(1AA) of the Act provides for the granting of injunctions by consent.
It provides: 
 '80(1AA) Where an application for an injunction under subsection (1) has been made, whether before or after the commencement of this subsection, the Court may, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, grant an injunction by consent of all the parties to the proceedings, whether or not the Court is satisfied that a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct of a kind mentioned in subsection (1).
' 

 Subsection (1) empowers the Court to grant injunctive relief where a person has engaged, or is proposing to engage, in conduct which constitutes, or would constitute, a contravention of, amongst other things, provisions of Part V of the Act.
It is apparent that the word 'from' was missing from the proposed orders numbered 6 and 7 in the Amended Application, and leave was granted to the applicant to amend the Amended Application to insert that word before the word 'representing' in each of those paragraphs.
The draft orders proposed by the applicant corrected the omission.
The question arises as to whether or not, in the circumstances, the Court should order declaratory relief as sought, or at all.
Section 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') empowers the court in relation to a matter in which it has original jurisdiction to make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.
In Australian Competition  Consumer Commission v Knight [2007] FCA 1011 , Mansfield J said, in relation to the making of declarations in cases such as this: 
 '[65] The Court has a wide discretion under section 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to make binding declarations of right (see, for example: Trade Practices Commission v Santos Limited (1993) ATPR 41-221 ; Tobacco Institute of Australia Limited v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89 ; RAIA Insurance Brokers Limited v FAI General Insurance Co Limited [1993] FCA 92 ; (1993) 41 FCR 164 ; Australian Competition  Consumer Commission v Target [2001] FCA 1326 ; (2001) ATPR 41-840 at [14] ...' 

 In Australian Competition  Consumer Commission v Chen [2003] FCA 897 ; (2003) 132 FCR 309 , Sackville J addressed the grant of declaratory relief under s 21(1) of the Federal Court Act.
At [35], his Honour said: 
 '[35] ... Sheppard J specifically recognised (at 100) [referring to Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) [1993] FCA 83 ; (1993) 41 FCR 89] that the policy of the TP Act, concerned as it is with the public interest, warrants the court, in an appropriate case, exercising its power to grant declaratory relief to mark its disapproval of particular conduct contravening the TP Act.
' 

 Senior Counsel for the applicant has submitted that, in the circumstances of this case, it would be appropriate for the Court to grant declaratory relief to mark its disapproval of the conduct of the respondents which has led to the respondents consenting to the injunctive relief sought by the applicant in this case.
The respondents are purveyors of quack medical advice and quack medicine.
