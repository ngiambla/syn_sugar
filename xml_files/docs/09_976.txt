 The applicants and respondents each carry on competing businesses in the scaffolding industry.
The first applicant (Cape) is the parent company of the second applicant (PCH).
The first applicant acquired control of PCH in a hostile takeover in about December 2007.
In early 2008, the first respondent established a related company, Modern Access Services Pty Ltd (MAS), the twelfth respondent, as a subsidiary of the first respondent to carry on the business of hiring out scaffolding and providing labour for scaffolding to the mining and resources industries.
Another company, Modern Industries Holdings Pty Ltd, which is also related to the first respondent, is the eleventh respondent.
The takeover of PCH by Cape created discontent among some of the employees of PCH and a number of employees of PCH left its employment shortly after the takeover had been completed.
Each of the second to tenth respondents is a former employee of PCH.
Each became an employee of MAS shortly after the termination of his employment with PCH.
The second respondent, Mr James Anderson, is the director and general manager of MAS.
He resigned from PCH in December 2007 because he disagreed with the way in which the new management at Cape were running the business of PCH.
Before his resignation, he was employed by PCH in the position of major projects director.
In 2008, each of PCH and MAS submitted competing tenders for the hire of scaffolding and the provision of scaffolding services to a company, MCC Mining WA Pty Ltd (MCC Mining) in respect of a project in Western Australia, known as the Sino Iron Ore project.
On 8 August 2008, Mr Stephen Murdoch, the executive director of Cape, learned that the tender submitted by MAS was accepted by MCC Mining and that submitted by PCH was rejected.
Each of MAS and PCH has also submitted tenders to Woodside Energy Ltd (Woodside) for the provision of scaffolding services to the Pluto project to be conducted by Woodside.
I have assumed that it was PCH and not Cape that submitted the tenders, but the evidence on this issue is far from clear.
I note that the letter from MCC Mining advising that the tender was unsuccessful was addressed to Cape and not PCH.
On 19 November 2008, the applicants commenced this proceeding for preliminary discovery of a number of documents.
The applicants sought preliminary discovery from the first, eleventh and twelfth respondents of the following classes of documents: Pursuant to Order 15A Rules 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules , the first, eleventh and twelfth respondents do within 14 days of the date of these orders, make discovery, verified on oath by an appropriate member or officer, of any documents in the following categories which are in its possession, custody or control, namely:
 
(a) all pre-qualification documents submitted by it or any subsidiary or related body corporate or associated entity during the period 1 April 2008 and 25 June 2008 ( First Relevant Period ) for tenders in relation to the project known in the public domain and/or or [sic] styled as the "Sino Iron Ore Project";
 
 
(b) all pre-qualification documents submitted by it or any subsidiary or related body corporate or associated entity during the period 1 July 2008 and 22 August 2008 ( Second Relevant Period ) for tenders in relation to the project known in the public domain and/or styled as the "Woodside Pluto Project" and references as Contract No 0C00002566;
 
 
(c) all tender documents, and relevant correspondence, submitted in relation to the:
 
 
(i) Sino Iron Ore project; and
 
 
(ii) Woodside Pluto project;
 
 
(d) all project data sheets and other marketing material that was generated by, or directed to be produced by, the first, eleventh and twelfth respondents during the First or Second Relevant Periods;
 
 
(e) any document which came into existence in the First or Second Relevant Periods which records or evidences any communication, whether oral or written, between any of the respondents and any third party, which contains a reference, directly or indirectly to:
 
 
(i) prior works that had been undertaken by the second applicant in relation to its business and/or commercial activities;
 
 
(ii) the business and/or commercial activities of the second applicant;
 
 
(iii) any tender of the second applicant, including any pre-qualification document.
(f) all documents owned by the first and second applicants.
The applicants also sought preliminary discovery from each of the second to tenth respondents of the following documents: Pursuant to Order 15A Rules 3 and 6 of the Federal Court Rules , the second to tenth respondents do within 14 days of the date of these orders, make discovery, verified on oath by an appropriate member or officer, of any documents in the following categories which are in its possession, custody or control, namely:
 
(a) all documents created by and/or received by the second to tenth respondents during the course of their employment with the second applicant concerning, or relating directly or indirectly to:
 
 
(i) the business activities of the applicants;
 
 
(ii) communications with the first, eleventh or twelfth respondents; and
 
 
(iii) business dealings with any party that related to the business and/or commercial activities of the applicants.
By the date of the hearing of this application, the outcome of the tender for the Pluto project was unknown.
BACKGROUND 
 The applicants rely upon a number of affidavits affirmed by Mr Stephen Murdoch, the executive director of Cape.
Mr Murdoch has held that position since 1 May 2008.
Two affidavits sworn by Mr Andrew White, the managing director of the first respondent were read on behalf of the first, eleventh and twelfth respondents.
Each of the second to tenth respondents swore an affidavit which was relied upon.
In his affidavit filed on 19 November 2008, Mr Murdoch deposed as follows: 
 In or about July 2008 it came to my attention that the content of many of the testimonials contained on the first respondent's website and some of the marketing literature, in particular project data sheets, on the first respondent's website were very similar to the second applicant's project data sheets.


 Mr Murdoch annexed to his affidavit a bundle of project data sheets marked "SM-2" from the first respondent and MAS.
Each project data sheet is a document which describes work carried out on an engineering project.
There are also one or more photographs of the engineering works comprising the project.
There were two categories of project data sheets which comprised "SM-2".
The first category comprised five project data sheets which contained the logo, "MAS modern access services" and are headed "MAS Management Track Record".
Each project data sheet contained a photograph of an engineering structure and was poorly presented.
These project data sheets were at pp 18-22 of the affidavit.
The second category comprised two project data sheets which contained the logo, "MW-Modern Industries".
They are well presented and contained more than one photograph of engineering structures.
These project data sheets were at p 17 and p 23 of the affidavit.
There is a very significant difference in the appearance of the two categories of project data sheets.
There was also annexed to Mr Murdoch's affidavit, marked "SM-3", six of PCH's project data sheets.
They were all in the same format which bears some resemblance to the format of the MAS project data sheets referred to above.
Mr Murdoch also deposed that in July 2008, he became aware that the first respondent had been handing out the project data sheets contained on its website to third parties.
On 21 July 2008, Mr Murdoch caused Mr Terry O'Connor, the regional sales and marketing director of Cape, to send a letter addressed to Mr Andrew White, managing director of the first respondent.
The letter stated: 
 It has come to my attention that the content of many of your testimonials and some of the Marketing literature on your website bears a striking resemblance to material produced by PCH and other Cape companies.
In many instances, the text used is taken verbatim from PCH marketing material.
Furthermore, many of the pictures you have used are identical to those owned and used by PCH (Cape).
For your reference I have attached five examples of the material which I am referring to.


 The five examples of the "Marketing literature" which were attached to the letter were the MAS project data sheets which were at pp 18-22 of Mr Murdoch's affidavit.
The letter went on to request that all material that had a "direct relationship with PCH or any other Cape company" be removed from the first respondent's website and that the first respondent destroy any marketing material containing the same information.
Mr White replied by letter dated 24 July 2008, in the following terms: 
 In reply to your letter dated 21 July 2008, I thank you for bringing the similarities in the Project Data Sheets of Modern Access Services Pty Ltd to my attention.
For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no further issues of these sheets in this form and the existing material in our possession has been destroyed.


 
 In relation to your comments regarding our website, please note that Modern Access Services website is still under construction and that the Modern Industries website is all original material.
The style has been developed by an independent marketing and graphic design company and has been in use for some time.


 
 If there is, however, something specific which concerns you that we may have overlooked, particularly given the relationship that existed between our companies in the Cape Modern Joint Venture Pty Ltd, which was active from the early 1990's until it was finally wound up in 2007, then please let me know.


 
 I trust that this addresses your concerns, however, if you wish to discuss anything further please do not hesitate to contact me.


 Mr Murdoch went on to depose that on 8 August 2008, it came to his attention that the first respondent or another entity in the Modern Industries Group, had submitted a successful tender for the Sino Iron Ore project.
This caused Mr Murdoch some concern.
Mr Murdoch said that he caused the applicants' solicitors, Blake Dawson to send a letter to each of the respondents.
On the instructions of Mr Murdoch, Blake Dawson sent a letter dated 19 August 2008 to the first respondent.
This letter stated: 
 We act for PCH Group Limited ( PCH ).


 
 We are instructed that: 

 several former employees of PCH have now been employed by Modern Industries Australia Pty Ltd ( Modern );
 Modern has recently been successful in tendering for a contract to provide services to Sinosteel (the Sinosteel project );
 the website of Modern continues to contain photos and other confidential information owned by PCH; and
 the website of Modern contains several project datasheets that imply that Modern undertook the works described, when in fact PCH undertook those works.
This letter also stated that PCH was concerned that its confidential information may have been used as part of Modern Industries' tender for the Sino Iron Ore project (mistakenly referred to in the letter as "the Sinosteel project").
The letter went on to say that PCH wished to verify this by reviewing the first respondent's tender documents for the Sino Iron Ore project.
