 However, the nature and context of the application for leave here involved in practical terms an appeal, or virtually so, as will hereafter emerge. 11 The Music companies contended that the Sharman applicants' submissions proceeded in reality 'on the erroneous basis that every interlocutory decision that requires a party to do an act will be automatically susceptible to leave to appeal and to being stayed'.
 So much accorded with Moore J's understanding of the nature of those orders, as indicated in [30] of his Honour's reasons for judgment. 12 The primary submission made by the Music companies as to why leave to appeal ought not to be granted related to the failure of the Sharman applicants to adduce evidence demonstrative of the claim that they would suffer 'substantial injustice', should leave be refused.
 I should interpolate to record that subsequent to reserving judgment on the question of leave to appeal, the Sharman applicants applied for a stay on Moore J's order requiring Ms Hemming to file that affidavit, and that I refused to grant that stay, but made orders requiring the affidavit to be left in a sealed envelope to be opened only upon further order of the Court.
