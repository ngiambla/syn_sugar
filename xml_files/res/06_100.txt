 It was suggested by the second respondent and the Attorney-General that orders with substantial operative effect should be made only in matter NSD 1957 of 2005, that is orders made setting aside what had been done by the Commission.
 However, that general duty is qualified by the power conferred on the President by s 46PH to terminate a complaint for one or more of the nominated grounds. 4 The applicant has submitted that in addition to any order requiring the Commission to refer some of her complaints to the President under s 46PD of the HREOC Act , there should be orders made requiring the President to inquire and attempt to conciliate under s 46PF and certain other orders concerning attendant powers of the President, including holding a conference under s 46PJ. 5 In my opinion, it is sufficient that an order be made requiring the Commission to refer the matter to the President.
 That power is a discretionary power available to the President and it would be inappropriate to make an order that assumes it will not be exercised. 7 Accordingly, I propose to make an order only that the complaints be referred to the President.
