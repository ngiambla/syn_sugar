 Emails concerning drafting of budgets (par 46 Strahley affidavit) 63 The respondents have indicated they have already discovered documents which satisfy this description, and it appears that the applicants did not press this claim in correspondence with the respondents. 64 In my view no order for discovery should be made.
 The respondents also submit that if documents were in the applicants' possession, custody or power and no longer are, the applicants need to say so in the list of documents. 113 I do not understand the respondents to be submitting that all relevant financial records of the third applicant are not in the possession of the administrator.
 Accordingly, in my view it is unnecessary to order discovery of those documents (O 14 r 2(4)). 176 In relation to the management reports between 22 March 2005 and 23 June 2005, the respondents claimed they would lead to a train of inquiry which would advance their case or damage the applicants' case.
