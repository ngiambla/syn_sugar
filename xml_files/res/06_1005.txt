 The Tribunal recorded in that regard however that it was '... told... that this had involved his borrowing further in order to obtain a lump sum to contribute to his tax debt' , and that '[h] e had proposed to pay the remainder by instalments' , but that at the hearing the Commissioner 'did not suggest any level of appropriate payment by instalments and pressed the Tribunal to make a finding that Mr Milne had not demonstrated serious hardship' . 28 Under the heading Final Analysis , the Tribunal undertook a comprehensive summary of what it considered to be the critical circumstances placed before it.
 The Tribunal found yet further favourably to Mr Milne that his '... problems are beyond his control when taking into account his partnership problems and ill health as well as the departure of his spouse, thus removing another possible source of assistance' . 30 The Tribunal summarised its detailed considerations and findings to the effect that '... although bankruptcy does not normally constitute serious hardship, Mr Milne's case was different... because there are special circumstances in his case' , the same being summarised as follows in summary: (i) his age and serious health problems; (ii) the few remaining years left in his working life; (iii) the dependency of his two children; (iv) the likely loss of his practising certificate in the event of bankruptcy, and thus of the means of earning a living.
 The Tribunal found that Mr Milne's 'battle to continue his professional work' , despite ill-health, and his need to support his dependent son until he finished school, were 'special factors' . 48 The approaches of the Tribunal's reasoning leading to its decision-making were attacked by the Commissioner as wrong, in that it was said to have 'misunderstood the meaning of serious hardship as a so-called backward looking matter, rather than a matter that turned on an objective analysis of the future'.
