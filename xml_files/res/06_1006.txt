 The appellant husband also claimed that as a result of his association with the leading candidate for the Congress Party, he was beaten by the same extremists so severely that his arm was broken and he was hospitalised. 3 The Tribunal found that the appellants claims lacked the necessary detail to establish relevant facts sufficient to establish refugee status, and in particular that it was not satisfied that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution.
 However it was said that the appellants wrote to the Tribunal declining that offer and asked for a determination in their absence. 4 The appellants asserted in their further amended application filed on 20 January 2005 that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration when it assessed whether the delegate of the Minister raised reasonable grounds for not granting a protection visa, and that the Tribunal failed in that regard to consider properly the chance of persecution if they were returned to India.
 The appellants advanced the following details in support of those assertions: first that the appellant husband was persecuted by Muslims because of his political popularity; secondly that the appellants were unable to collect documentary evidence; thirdly that the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate particulars of the independent country information; fourthly that the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate opportunity to respond to the substance of this information; fifthly that the information used by the Tribunal did not show that Congress politicians are safe; sixthly that the appellants did not get an opportunity to attend the Tribunal hearing because they were not informed of the consequences of non-attendance or the hearing procedure; seventhly that the appellants needed an opportunity to give oral evidence and the decision of the Tribunal was affected by a lack of procedural fairness; and eighthly, that since the appellants had been persecuted by the BJP, it would not be possible for them to relocate in India. 5 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal's decision was unaffected by jurisdictional error and therefore dismissed the application with costs.
