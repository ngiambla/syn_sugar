 The appellants advanced the following details in support of those assertions: first that the appellant husband was persecuted by Muslims because of his political popularity; secondly that the appellants were unable to collect documentary evidence; thirdly that the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate particulars of the independent country information; fourthly that the Tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate opportunity to respond to the substance of this information; fifthly that the information used by the Tribunal did not show that Congress politicians are safe; sixthly that the appellants did not get an opportunity to attend the Tribunal hearing because they were not informed of the consequences of non-attendance or the hearing procedure; seventhly that the appellants needed an opportunity to give oral evidence and the decision of the Tribunal was affected by a lack of procedural fairness; and eighthly, that since the appellants had been persecuted by the BJP, it would not be possible for them to relocate in India. 5 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal's decision was unaffected by jurisdictional error and therefore dismissed the application with costs.
 Moreover Barnes FM explained that the Tribunal did consider the consequences of relocation in India, and found that so much would be possible having regard to the material placed before it to the effect that the appellant husband held business interests in four States of India and the BJP was not a dominant political party in other States.
 The Federal Magistrate further held that the Tribunal's decision did not lack rational and logical reasoning and did not contravene the Act because the appellants made the choice not to give further evidence, and consequently the Tribunal was entitled to proceed on that footing. 6 The notice of appeal raised the following grounds: first, that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision; secondly that the Tribunal failed to 'assess the harm from the perspective of the persecutor' when considering the question of well-founded fear; thirdly that the Tribunal did not properly consider the basis of fear of persecution and ignored the appellant husband's evidence concerning his political activities; fourthly that the 'Tribunal adopted a harsh approach' and failed to give 'importance to the real issues' relevant to the case as to denial of procedural fairness in favour of the appellant.
