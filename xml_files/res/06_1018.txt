 He further claimed unspecifically that the Tribunal did not observe the relevant requirements of the Act, and failed in any event to provide him with particulars of country information said to have been relied upon, and otherwise to give him an adequate opportunity to respond to the evidence adduced and submissions made by the Minister.
 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had made findings that were open on the evidence placed before it, and moreover that no jurisdictional error was identifiable in relation to the Tribunal's conduct of its procedures or in its reasons for decision. 6 In support of the application for an extension of time generally, the applicant provided an affidavit stating that he thought he was allowed a period of 28 days to file an appeal.
 The applicant also produced a draft notice of appeal upon grounds to the effect that the Federal Magistrate below erred in not holding that the Tribunal failed to take into account a relevant consideration, being the fact that his father was killed by his uncle for a political reason, and in considering whether the applicant was a member of a particular social group comprising his family members.
