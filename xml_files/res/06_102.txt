 1 This is an application by the plaintiff, Paul William Gidley (Gidley), for directions concerning the fixing of his remuneration as administrator of, and as administrator of the deed of company arrangement (DOCA) for Aliance Motor Body Pty Limited (subject to a deed of company arrangement) (Aliance) pursuant to s 449E of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).
 Remuneration of Administrators That the remuneration of the Joint and Several Administrators his partners and staff, for the period 20 June 2005 to the (sic) 15 July 2005, be approved on a time basis in accordance with Lawler Partners guide to hourly rates in the amount of $34,703 plus GST in the amount of $3,470.30.
 It would follow that the remuneration of an administrator of a company under administration would normally be fixed substantially retrospectively, having in mind the timing and purpose of a s 439A meeting, but that of the administrator of a DOCA could be fixed prospectively.
