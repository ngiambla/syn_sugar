 The Magistrate made an order dismissing an application under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). 2 The application to the Federal Magistrates Court under s 476 of the Act was supported by an affidavit as required by r 44.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 and it came before the Magistrate on a first court date on 30 January 2006.
 The Magistrate concluded that the application failed to disclose an arguable case within r 44.12(1)(a) and, accordingly, he dismissed it. 4 On 23 March 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal from the decision in this Court.
 The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs filed a notice of objection to competency of the appeal and submits that the appeal is not competent in the absence of a grant of leave to appeal.
 The test for granting leave to appeal is well known and I will not repeat it: Decor Corporation v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399-400. 5 The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China, and she arrived in Australia on 15 March 2005.
 On 6 September 2005, the applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of that decision. 6 The applicant was born on 6 March 1957 and she claims that she is one of the leaders of Falon Gong in Shanghai, China.
 She was told that if she did not attend the hearing and if the Tribunal did not postpone the hearing, then the Tribunal could make a decision on her case without further notice.
 The Tribunal decided to affirm the decision of the delegate of the Minister. 9 In the course of its reasons, the Tribunal said: 'Generally, where broad allegations are made, the Tribunal hearing is an opportunity for the Tribunal to gather detail about the claims with the applicant.
 First, she asserted that the Tribunal did not comply with its obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments.
 Thirdly, the Magistrate said that the information did not need to be disclosed because it was the insufficiency of the information that was determinative and not any particular information contained in the visa application.
 His conclusions are supported by authority, including VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 per Finn and Stone JJ at 476-477, at [24] and SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238. 14 Neither ground of challenge is arguable and, in those circumstances, the application for leave to appeal must be dismissed with costs.
