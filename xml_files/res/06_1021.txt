 The Magistrate concluded that the application failed to disclose an arguable case within r 44.12(1)(a) and, accordingly, he dismissed it. 4 On 23 March 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal from the decision in this Court.
 The Minister does not object to me treating the purported notice of appeal as an application for leave to appeal, and I think that that is the appropriate course.
 The applicant has been put on notice by the Tribunal that it is unable to make a favourable decision on the information before it but has not provided any further information in support of her claims despite ample opportunity to do so.
