 The Magistrate rejected that submission on the ground that the reason for the Tribunal's decision was the inadequacy of the material provided to the Tribunal, and inadequacy of a claim is not 'information' for the purposes of s 424A of the Act.
 The Magistrate said that inadequacy of information is no more than a subjective appraisal by the Tribunal about the material provided and a subjective appraisal of the material does not constitute information for the purpose of s 424A.
 The Magistrate referred to VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 and SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195. 7 Secondly, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal failed to invite him to appear before it, and, therefore, proceeded in breach of s 425(1) of the Act.
 He referred to NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184. 8 The Magistrate's conclusion was that the decision of the Tribunal was a privative clause decision within s 474 of the Act and that there was no jurisdictional error.
