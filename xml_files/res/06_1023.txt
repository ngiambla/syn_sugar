 Secondly, injunctive relief was sought in respect of alleged contraventions of s 1041H(1) of the Act and s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). 3 The injunctive relief that was sought was firstly an injunction restraining Coopers Brewery from taking any further steps pursuant to a notice of meeting issued by it on 21 September 2005, including the conducting of the meeting proposed to be held on 20 October 2005.
 The interlocutory relief which was sought was an order that until the hearing and determination of the application or further order, the defendants be restrained from taking any further steps pursuant to the notice of meeting issued on 21 September 2005, including the conducting of the meeting proposed to be held on 20 October 2005. 4 There is a commercial background to the application which was the announcement by Lion Nathan of a proposal to make takeover offers for all the shares in the capital of Coopers Brewery.
 The application for interlocutory relief came on for hearing on 3 and 5 October 2005, and on 11 October 2005, upon Lion Nathan proffering the usual undertaking as to damages, I ordered that Coopers Brewery and its directors be restrained from proceeding further with the conduct of the meeting of shareholders convened by notice dated 21 September 2005 and proposed to be held on 20 October 2005, other than to adjourn it to a date and time to be fixed.
