 He claimed to have previously been a member of the Muslim League and that he was being persecuted by the Muslim League in order to prevent him from providing evidence about riots and murders in 1996, and because he refused to travel to Pakistan for training as a militant.
 The Tribunal considered the appellant's language skills, independence and political profile, amongst other things, in conjunction with the fact the appellant's problems were local, and found that relocation within India was a reasonable option. 4 On 19 March 2004 the appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia.
 On 12 November 2004 the appellant filed an amended application which alleged that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction and constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction by: failing to find that the appellant would be abducted by Pakistani underground agents and the Muslim League even if he relocated; that it failed to give valid reasons why relocation would be safe; failed to consider that the appellant was on a hit list; and failed to understand that the appellant did not face harassment from shopkeepers but from Pakistani underground agents, the Muslim League and Indian authorities. 5 On 28 March 2006 the appellant filed written submissions raising the following grounds of review: that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by way of identifying a wrong issue; that the Tribunal relied on irrelevant material; made an erroneous finding and reached mistaken conclusions; that the Tribunal was biased; that it did not comply with procedural fairness; that the decision was made in bad faith; the Tribunal erred in its relocation findings which were unfair and out of context; that the Tribunal held a positive state of disbelief while making credibility findings; and the independent country information was irrelevant.
