 Mr Caulfield said 'no'. 26 It is admitted by the respondents that, by that conduct, Cambur Industries, through Mr Caulfield, attempted to induce Pete N Peppa not to sell and advertise Cambur products at prices less than prices specified by Cambur Industries. 27 The folder of documents previously referred to also contained a Cambur Newsletter dated July 2003 for authorised stockists.
 In the case of Mr Caulfield, I have reached the figure of $32,000 by fixing a figure of $18,400 in the case of its conduct in relation to Pete N Peppa and a figure of $13,600 in the case of its conduct in relation to Tabletop and Kitchen.
