 Mr Caulfield said 'no'. 26 It is admitted by the respondents that, by that conduct, Cambur Industries, through Mr Caulfield, attempted to induce Pete N Peppa not to sell and advertise Cambur products at prices less than prices specified by Cambur Industries. 27 The folder of documents previously referred to also contained a Cambur Newsletter dated July 2003 for authorised stockists.
 The newsletter included a statement to the effect that the Bamix cassette Swiss-line (Model 7BA00240D) would retail at $349. 28 It is admitted by the respondents that, by providing the Cambur Newsletter, Cambur Industries, through Mr Caulfield, attempted to induce Pete N Peppa not to engage in advertising Cambur products at prices less than prices specified by Cambur Industries. 29 On three occasions between October 2003 and January 2004, Cambur Industries, through Mr Caulfield, told Pete N Peppa that Pete N Peppa could not discount various Cambur products.
 He told Mr Milosevic that if Pete N Peppa lost the Nespresso coffee machines, it would cease to be a retailer of all Cambur products. 36 It is admitted by the respondents that, by that conduct, Cambur Industries, through Mr Caulfield, made it known to Pete N Peppa that it would not continue to supply Cambur products to Pete N Peppa unless Pete N Peppa agreed not to sell and advertise Cambur products at prices less than prices specified by Cambur Industries, and attempted to induce Pete N Peppa not to sell and advertise Cambur products at prices less than prices specified by Cambur Industries.
 In the case of Mr Caulfield, I have reached the figure of $32,000 by fixing a figure of $18,400 in the case of its conduct in relation to Pete N Peppa and a figure of $13,600 in the case of its conduct in relation to Tabletop and Kitchen.
