 Paragraph 3 records part of the reasons of the Tribunal. 42 In para 4 of that affidavit the applicant deposes to, and annexes documentation relating to, the circumstance of the termination of her pregnancy, her dealings with university officers at ECU, her appeals at ECU and the lodgment of her application with the Tribunal.
 The Tribunal also erred in failing to inquire whether ECU's determination to exclude the applicant for six months amounted to ECU certifying that the applicant's academic result was 'at least satisfactory'. 3 The Tribunal erred in failing to address the question of whether, when the applicant had attended the office of the department in response to the s 20 Notice, the delegate had denied the applicant procedural fairness in failing to provide her with an opportunity to give evidence as to her medical and psychological condition for the purpose of 'explaining the breach' before the delegate issued the s 119 Notice. 4 The Tribunal erred in failing to find that the applicant was denied procedural fairness by reason of having been issued with a s 20 Notice which was misleading.
 The s 20 Notice failed to inform the applicant that s 116 of the Act requires the Minister to cancel a visa for breach of Condition 8202 irrespective of any exceptional circumstances which may exist, whereas on the automatic cancellation of the visa under s 137J of the Act, it was open to the applicant to rely upon exceptional circumstances to revoke the automatic cancellation.
 As already mentioned in [56] above, the Full Court in Zhou 2006 has confirmed that there is no legal interaction between the giving of a s 20 Notice and the cancellation of a visa under s 116 of the Act, even where the issue of a s 20 Notice gives rise to the issue of a s 119 Notice.
