 The s 20 Notice failed to inform the applicant that s 116 of the Act requires the Minister to cancel a visa for breach of Condition 8202 irrespective of any exceptional circumstances which may exist, whereas on the automatic cancellation of the visa under s 137J of the Act, it was open to the applicant to rely upon exceptional circumstances to revoke the automatic cancellation.
 As already mentioned in [56] above, the Full Court in Zhou 2006 has confirmed that there is no legal interaction between the giving of a s 20 Notice and the cancellation of a visa under s 116 of the Act, even where the issue of a s 20 Notice gives rise to the issue of a s 119 Notice.
