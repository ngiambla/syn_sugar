 The applicant contended before Federal Magistrate Barnes that his English was poor and as a result the applicant did not understand what material he should provide in support of the grounds of review. 9 In the application before me, the applicant said that he was assisted by a friend who had helped him to formulate the draft notice of appeal.
 The applicant told me that he understood the document prepared by his friend and that he had nothing further to add to it. 10 The respondent says that the applicant was present (as the judgment reveals) in court when Federal Magistrate Barnes delivered judgment on 19 January 2006 at the conclusion of the hearing. 11 Having regard to these events, I am not satisfied that the explanation for the delay is to be found in 'language problems'.
 The first was that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 426A of the Act in making a decision on the review in the absence of the applicant consequent upon the invitation pursuant to s 425 of the Act to the applicant to appear.
