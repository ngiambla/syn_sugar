 The applicant told me that he understood the document prepared by his friend and that he had nothing further to add to it. 10 The respondent says that the applicant was present (as the judgment reveals) in court when Federal Magistrate Barnes delivered judgment on 19 January 2006 at the conclusion of the hearing. 11 Having regard to these events, I am not satisfied that the explanation for the delay is to be found in 'language problems'.
 The applicant contends that the respondent had a statutory duty pursuant to s 418(3) of the Act to provide the Registrar of the Tribunal with a copy of each and every document in the possession of the respondent and considered by the respondent's delegate in assessing and determining the application for a Protection Visa.
 The first was that the Tribunal failed to comply with s 426A of the Act in making a decision on the review in the absence of the applicant consequent upon the invitation pursuant to s 425 of the Act to the applicant to appear.
 The second ground was that the Tribunal failed to conduct a real rather than a purported exercise of its jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision in that the Tribunal failed to determine whether the applicant was a practising adherent of the Roman Catholic faith in China.
