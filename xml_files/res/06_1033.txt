 Her legal representation has changed during the life of the proceeding. 3 In recent months Dr Wearne has filed a second amended application ('the Application') and a third amended statement of claim ('the Statement of Claim').
 Alleged Breach of Implied Term 25 The Statement of Claim does not plead as a material fact that the University breached the implied term in one or more specified ways and then particularise the specified breach or breaches.
 The University is entitled to know precisely how it is alleged to have conducted itself in a manner calculated or likely to damage or destroy the relationship of trust and confidence between it and Dr Wearne so that it may, should it be so advised, respond by alleging that the conduct relied upon (whether or not admitted) is incapable of constituting a breach of the implied term. 28 I accept that the manner in which the Statement of Claim pleads the alleged breaches of the implied term has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay.
