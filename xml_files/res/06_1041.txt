 On the basis that the Bankruptcy Notice was served on the Debtor on 16 November 2005, the Debtor committed an act of bankruptcy on 7 December 2005. 15 The Creditor's Petition, specifying that act of bankruptcy, was issued on 19 April 2006, and, subject to what is said below about service, was served on the Debtor on 3 May 2006.
 CONSIDERATION First, second and fourth grounds of opposition: "The Applicant was not served with a Bankruptcy Notice as alleged or at all" "Copy of Notice faxed after Creditor's Petition indicates that Notice expired (past 6 months) from date of issue" "The Applicant was not served with both the Bankruptcy Notice and the Extension Notice" 16 These three grounds are interrelated and it is convenient to deal with them together.
 Subsection 41(2) provides that a bankruptcy notice must be in accordance with the form prescribed by the Bankruptcy Regulations . 25 These provisions show that a judgment creditor can serve a bankruptcy notice, that is, a document having effect as a "bankruptcy notice" under the Act , only because the Act so permits.
