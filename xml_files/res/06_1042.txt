 Nature and basis of the application --- the nature and outcome of the previously unsuccessful application for refugee status dismissed by the Tribunal and of the appeal to a single judge of this Court 1 This is an application for an extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal from the judgment of O'Connor J, a former justice of this Court, delivered as long ago as 10 June 1998.
 I have subsequently referred to her Honour in these reasons on occasions as the primary judge. 2 The present application for an extension of time within which to appeal from the judgment of O'Connor J followed immediately upon a recent unsuccessful application made by the applicant to the Federal Magistrates Court, heard and determined on 25 May 2006, to review the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal which had been previously the subject of the unsuccessful application for review dismissed by O'Connor J.
 That last mentioned application was dismissed by the Minister and the dismissal was notified to the applicant by a Departmental letter dated 6 May 1999. 9 Ultimately in February 2004, the applicant ceased involvement in that class action, and in March 2004, he commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court once more for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal made adversely to the applicant earlier on 30 December 1997.
 The applicant asserted that two grounds for review had been propounded to Raphael FM below, which I will now record and discuss. 21 The asserted first ground for review was based on the applicant's account to the Tribunal of an incident '... one night in 1987 [when] he was attacked and kidnapped by a Muslim group' and 'held for several days until the leader of his Buddhist organisation paid a ransom to have him released'.
