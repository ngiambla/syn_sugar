 2 On 26 May 2006 the Court delivered judgment in respect of a security for costs application made by the second respondent ('GCB'): see Wyong-Gosford Progressive Community Radio Inc v Australian Communications and Media Authority [2006] FCA 625 ('the May decision').
 WHETHER THE LITIGATION WILL BE STIFLED BY AN ORDER 18 PCR has submitted, and I accept, that there is a risk that the litigation may be stifled if an order for security for costs is made, and certainly if an order is made in any significant amount.
 ACMA has suggested that, because of the change in the future course of the proceedings engendered by the filing of the amended application, it was entitled to change its position on security for costs.
 It says that when the proceedings were commenced ACMA faced only a leave application, whereas now it faces a full hearing. 24 However, there was always a possibility that leave would be granted to the ADJR Act application, in which case ACMA would also have faced a full hearing.
