 In NAVX v MIMIA , relied upon by her Honour, the appellant advised the Tribunal that he did not wish to give evidence and that he consented to the Tribunal deciding his application without hearing him. 18 At paragraphs [23] --- [25] of the judgment, her Honour addressed the complaint made by the appellant that his migration agent had 'put him into the dark' concerning the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal and thus the appellant had not been afforded procedural fairness.
 Whilst in MIMIA v SZFHC , the appellant failed to respond to a hearing invitation issued by the Tribunal and in NAVX v MIMIA and NASF v MIMIA , the respective appellant elected not to attend before the Tribunal in response to an invitation, these differences, it is said, do not give rise to any constraint upon the general principle identified by the respondent. 20 It is common ground that the Tribunal complied with the requirements of the Act in inviting the appellant to appear before it and in issuing the notice.
