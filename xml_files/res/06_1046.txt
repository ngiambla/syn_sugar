 The figure estimated by the cost assessor as reasonable for both the Cross-Claim and the hearing at first instance is $843,199.42, which comprises solicitors' profit costs of $482,046.81 and disbursements of $365,691.61 less work done for taxation in an amount of $4,539.00.
 The principles and approaches are also set out and considered by von Doussa J in Sparnon Ors v Apand Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 164 in which his Honour fixed a gross amount of $634, 320.54 where the actual costs paid by the client totalled $1,040,135.80.
 It is apparent that the amount now claimed is a very high percentage of the solicitor-client costs, and it appears to me that some substantial allowance must be made for challenges to the items referred to in the expert Report and detailed in the schedule compiled by Nine's costs consultant.
