 Mr Wild gave a similar assurance that 'as far as possible' employment with John Holland would be offered on the 'exact same terms and conditions' as those applicable at Transfield. 15 Around this time, Mr Serventi had a meeting with Mr Wild.
 Mr Wild later repeated the substance of this conversation to Mr Sasse, although the timing of this disclosure was disputed: Mr Wild said that it occurred prior to Mr Serventi's employment being terminated, and that at that time he formed the opinion that neither Mr Serventi nor Mr Sasse 'was particularly fond of the other'.
 Mr Sasse explained the email surveillance (in a facsimile to John Holland's legal representatives with the subject heading 'Serventi') by reference to the view that 'we [John Holland] knew he [that is, Power] was being mischievous'.
 Suggestions of misconduct by Mr Serventi --- a John Holland conspiracy? 22 In August 2003, Mr Sasse commenced an investigation into Mr Serventi, apparently following a suggestion by an anonymous informant that Mr Serventi's bank accounts should be examined.
