 But such a conclusion would not be consistent with the words used in Item 2 of the Schedule or Note 1 and, furthermore, would fail to meet the evident purpose of a bankruptcy notice prescribed by the Act and Regulations, namely, to give a debtor notice of how the amount set out in the Notice has been calculated as the amount owing. 17 Item 2 of the Schedule is not restricted to legal costs not included in the judgments or orders referred to in Item 1.
 The amounts due under more than one final judgment or order, including a costs order, would be aggregated in Item 1 of the Schedule and pursuant to the reasoning in Stec no amount or certificate of costs taxed pursuant to a costs order could be said to be relevant to Item 2 and Note 1 of the Schedule. 19 In any event to comply with the requirements of the Act it was necessary for BGC to deliver to the Official Receiver for attachment to the Notice a copy of the judgment entered in the Local Court on 17 October 2003 and a copy of any other order for the payment of costs that BGC sought to have included in the Notice as the debt claimed to be due. (See: Commonwealth Bank v Horvath ). 20 The document dated 6 April 2005 attached to the Notice purported to be a certified copy of the judgment entered on 17 October 2003.
 It misstated the amount of that judgment debt by aggregating with that sum amounts of taxed costs that became payable under other orders. 21 No copies of those other orders, or certificates of the costs taxed pursuant thereto, were attached to the Notice. 22 It may be assumed that pursuant to O 23 r 6(2) of the Local Court Rules 1961 (WA), BGC prepared a praecipe of the certified judgment sought to be attached to the Notice and was responsible for the misstatement in the Notice of the amount of the judgment debt entered on 17 October 2003. 23 In light of the foregoing BGC conceded that the Notice must be set aside.
