 In the course of proceedings before me, Mr Judd, senor counsel for AWB, confirmed that AWB does not seek to assert any claim of legal professional privilege over the documents. 4 In correspondence and other exchanges between AWB's solicitors and the Inquiry this week, the Inquiry told AWB on several occasions that it intends to publish the documents.
 It is difficult to see why the additional references in the documents to legal advice would alter the risk of waiver that AWB already confronts as a result of the prior publication of very similar material. 13 Thirdly, in the course of this case, the Commonwealth has relied upon previous occasions on which AWB has disclosed the existence and substance of legal advice to contend that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated documents.
