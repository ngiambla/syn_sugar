 1 On 30 March 2006 a Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for review due to the failure of the applicant to appear pursuant to r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .
 The Federal Magistrate who heard that application did not accept the applicant's version of events and did not accept that there was any proper explanation of the failure to appear.
 Leave to appeal is therefore refused. 3 It should be noted that the consequence of this decision is that the applicant has not had any hearing on the merits of her application to the Federal Magistrates Court.
