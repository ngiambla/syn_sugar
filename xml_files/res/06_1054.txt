 It refers to s 125 of the Insurance Act which acknowledges that s 56 of the APRA Act prohibits certain disclosures of information under the Insurance Act . 6 In the May decision I rejected the applicant's submission that review of the lawfulness of the exercise of a power bestowed by a prudential regulation framework law is a review for the purposes of a prudential regulation framework law.
 I accept however that there is no other authority upon this point, and that it raises an important issue relating to the relationship between the APRA Act and the rights of administrative review arising under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act') and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
 In the May decision, the Court rejected the applicant's attempt to gain access to the entirety of the draft reports using a notice to produce on an application for preliminary discovery. 10 In written submissions the applicant said that this is not a case in which the applicant did not possess sufficient factual material to substantiate O 15A r 6(a) of the Federal Court Rules .
 The applicant submits that the Full Federal Court decision in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 is authority for the proposition that notices to produce may be issued in respect of factual disputes on preliminary discovery applications. 13 In the May decision, I found that there was no relevant factual dispute between the parties.
