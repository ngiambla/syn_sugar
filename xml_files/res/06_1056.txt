 Any inaccuracy in these representations is minor and technical and would not warrant an injunction restraining use of the whole document. 10 As to (b), the document includes the following statement: " Note : The franchisor notes that in 2004 Four Seasons Gutter Protection Pty Ltd, Derek Murphy and Michelle Murphy instituted defamation proceedings against Leafbusters Pty Ltd and Theofani Tsioris in the Victorian division of the Federal Court of Australia.
 The judgments of the Court can be viewed by typing in Four Seasons on www.federalcourt.gov.au under the 'Search Judgments' option. " Counsel for Leafbusters submitted that this did not "disclose the nature of the proceedings by Leafbusters, which include allegations of contravention of trade practices law and misconduct".
 In a previous answer "the relevant intellectual property" has been described as the words "Four Seasons Gutter Protection" and logo and patents pending as to the Four Seasons mesh in respect of which Four Seasons holds a licence from the manufacturer Tapex Pty Ltd.
 As I have said, the present litigation has been adequately disclosed. 12 There is not a serious issue to be tried in respect of the GSF Disclosure Statement. (iv) GSF Franchise Agreement 13 The GSF Franchise Agreement is a straight, word for word copy of a complex 43 page legal agreement used by Leafbusters.
