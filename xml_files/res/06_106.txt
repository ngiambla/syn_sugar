 Material was seized pursuant to the warrants, including material which was the property of the applicant. 7 Under s 7C of the ACC Act , the board of the ACC may determine in writing that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation.
 For instance, s 3E requires that the issuing officer must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is, or there will be within the next 72 hours, any evidential material (as defined) at the premises to which the search warrant is to relate.
 REJECTION OF THE APPLICANT'S CASE 26 In my opinion, the arguments advanced by the applicant are unsound and I reject them. 27 In summary, I consider that there is no justification for reading down Pt 1AA of the Crimes Act by reference to s 22 of the ACC Act .
