 On Mr Somerset's approach to Mr Turpie and the "It works" advertisement, Dr Vaisman said: 49 Mr Somerset called him in mid-2003 to suggest using Mr Turpie to endorse AMI products, and after making some inquires he agreed to engage Mr Turpie's services for $18,000 for one year.
 In my view, Mr Turpie and Mr Somerset must surely have discussed the matter and agreed that the name "Roxanne" would be used, and I so find. 172 Fifthly, there is Mr Turpie's evidence concerning his telephone conversation with Dr Balafas.
