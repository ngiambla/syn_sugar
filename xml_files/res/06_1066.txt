 On Mr Somerset's approach to Mr Turpie and the "It works" advertisement, Dr Vaisman said: 49 Mr Somerset called him in mid-2003 to suggest using Mr Turpie to endorse AMI products, and after making some inquires he agreed to engage Mr Turpie's services for $18,000 for one year.
 In my view, Mr Turpie and Mr Somerset must surely have discussed the matter and agreed that the name "Roxanne" would be used, and I so find. 172 Fifthly, there is Mr Turpie's evidence concerning his telephone conversation with Dr Balafas.
 Mr Somerset suggested a confessional advertisement, and, for money, Mr Turpie was ready to participate in the lie. 300 Mr Somerset suggested that Mr Turpie use the nasal spray so that he could truthfully tell any journalist that he had done so.
