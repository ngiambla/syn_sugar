 He claimed that the Tribunal did not get in touch with the Australia Embassy in Nepal to investigate the credibility of the police document provided by the appellant, despite assurances that it would do so, and moreover that the Tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by not providing the appellant with an opportunity to comment on adverse materials.
 The Federal Magistrate found further that there was nothing to show the findings relating only to Nepal were dependent on, or affected by, the findings in relation to India and observed that in order for the appellant to succeed, there must be established some legal error in the first line of the Tribunal's reasoning.
 His Honour observed authority where relief was not granted, irrespective of a breach of s 424A of the Migration Act , because of the existence of substantial and separate bases for the decision that were not affected by any such breach. 7 The Federal Magistrate examined the documents which the appellant asserted the Tribunal had failed to consider but found that the ground thereby invoked did not rise above anything more than disagreement with the Tribunal's finding as to the appellant's 'profile' and thus constituted only impermissible merits review.
 The Federal Magistrate observed that the document submitted by the appellant purporting to be the transcript of the Tribunal hearing was not admissible, but even if it was, his Honour further observed that the document did not assist the appellant's case that the Tribunal failed to address an important aspect of his claims. 8 The Federal Magistrate found that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to set a line by line refutation of evidence which it did not accept, and that the Tribunal did not express a conclusion that any of the documents submitted by the appellant were not genuine.
