 Section 9(4) provides that the prescribed provisions of Pt II (which include s 22) "have effect as provided by ... the following provisions of this section and not otherwise. " The following provisions of s 9 include subsection (10) which refers to "the Convention", earlier identified in s 4 as the " Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ".
 Thus the definition makes it clear that the Convention is concerned with discrimination against all women, married and unmarried, including discrimination (ie less favourable treatment than men) against women because they are married (or unmarried) women. 36 That the definition does not extend to discrimination against all persons, male or female, simply on the ground of marital status, and is confined to discrimination against women, is confirmed by an example of the construction given by the international community (as to the admissibility of such material see Queensland v The Commonwealth , above, at 240).
 Adoption by State Parties of special temporary measures aimed at accelerating " de facto equality between men and women " shall not be considered discrimination but shall not entail the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; such measures are to be discontinued when the objectives of " equality of opportunity and treatment " have been achieved.
