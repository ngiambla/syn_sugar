 Even if the investors had some cause of action for damages against the persons involved in promoting the schemes for not carrying out their promotional and management obligations properly or for misrepresentation or breach of warranty (on which I express no view) it was difficult to see how such causes of action should create an inhibition on the opportunity for McKinnon Road to rescind the contract of sale. 20 The investors were not themselves currently proposing to institute any proceedings against any of the defendants or persons involved in the promotion and implementation of the schemes for not carrying out their obligations properly or for misrepresentation or breach of warranty but rather wished to preserve the position or opportunity for that to be done in the future either by the liquidator on their behalf or by themselves individually.
 The jurisdiction was assumed. 39 Primelife referred to Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Landy DFK Securities Ltd [2002] FCA 1056 ; (2002) 123 FCR 548 in which a managed investment scheme was ordered to be wound up pursuant to s 601EE of the Act and the Court appointed liquidators of the scheme.
 The liquidators filed a motion in the winding up proceeding seeking an order for possession of a property owned by the scheme and an injunction restraining the occupant of the property, who claimed to be a lessee under a lease and entitled to purchase the property under an option in the lease, from remaining in possession of the property.
