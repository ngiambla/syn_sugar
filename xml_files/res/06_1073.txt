 The company was able to obtain the funds to make the payments to the defendant by the sale of plant and equipment; and by an advance to the company by another company controlled by the directors of the company. 9 However, after July 2003, the company was still unable to satisfy the ongoing taxation liabilities to the defendant.
 On 28 November 2003, a day before the winding up application was due to be heard, the first plaintiff was appointed as the administrator of the company. 10 On 5 December 2003, Citywide Nominees Pty Ltd and Cash-Flow Factors Pty Ltd, both trading as Cash-Flow Factors ('Cash-Flow Factors'), with whom the company had entered into a factoring agreement, appointed a receiver and manager pursuant to a charge which the company had given over its assets. 11 On 22 April 2004 the first plaintiff was appointed as the liquidator of the company by a resolution of the creditors of the company.
 However, the defence does not admit that the company was insolvent on the date that the payments were made and nor that in receiving the payments the defendant had received a preference. 18 On 7 June 2005 the plaintiffs filed an application for summary judgment under O 20 r 1 of the Federal Court Rules for orders that the defendant pay the sum of $493 437.63 and interest to the second plaintiff.
 The Court is concerned to determine '...whether the company's position as a whole reveals surmountable temporary illiquidity or insurmountable endemic illiquidity resulting in insolvency...' ( Southern Cross Interiors at 225). 27 The first plaintiff has annexed to his affidavit of 3 June 2005 extracts of the company's bank statements for the periods when the impugned payments were made.
 The first plaintiff deposed that the failure, therefore, of Peak Hill Manganese Pty Ltd to pay its debt would mean that the actual amount of the company's net realisable receivables as at 30 June 2003 was no more than $152 540.97 (being 32.5 per cent of $469 356.86). 30 Further, the first plaintiff stated that he had had not seen any documentation to support the existence of an amount of $876 834.09 recorded as undeposited funds in the balance sheet.
 The first plaintiff's opinion is based on the amounts recorded in the company's balance sheet. 32 The first plaintiff also says that the company had no overdraft facility at the time of the payments. 33 On 30 June 2003, aside from the debts due to the defendant in respect of unpaid tax, the company had debts due to trade creditors which had not been paid for more than 60 days, totalling $314 853.79, including $273 695.48, which had not been paid for more than 90 days.
 These deposits into the company's bank account occurred as a consequence of the sale of assets by the directors and the advance of funds from a related party. 34 In my view, the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence of the company's position as a whole, is that at the time that the payments were made the company could not pay all of its debts as and when they fell due and payable and was, therefore, insolvent.
 This conclusion is based upon the following considerations. 35 Firstly, by the beginning of July 2003 the company had failed to comply with a statutory demand of $404 382.37 issued by the defendant and that there were debts that had been outstanding to trade creditors for more than 60 days which totalled $314 853.97.
 This inference is based upon the extent of the aged creditors which had accrued by the beginning of July 2003; and, further, from the fact that after having made the payments to the defendant, the company was thereafter not able to meet on a continuing basis, its taxation obligations to the defendant.
 Those sources are not, in my view, therefore, to be characterised as 'realisable assets' of the company as at 1 July 2003. 37 Secondly, the overall financial position shows that at the time that the impugned payments were made the company was not suffering from a temporary liquidity problem but from an endemic and chronic shortage of working capital.
 In any event, each of the cases which was referred to by counsel is distinguishable from this case because in those cases the company was seeking to rebut the presumption of insolvency by proving it actually was solvent. 40 Further, the evidence of the first plaintiff is based upon the financial records of the company as they existed as at 30 June 2003.
