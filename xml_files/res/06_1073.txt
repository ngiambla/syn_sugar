 On 28 November 2003, a day before the winding up application was due to be heard, the first plaintiff was appointed as the administrator of the company. 10 On 5 December 2003, Citywide Nominees Pty Ltd and Cash-Flow Factors Pty Ltd, both trading as Cash-Flow Factors ('Cash-Flow Factors'), with whom the company had entered into a factoring agreement, appointed a receiver and manager pursuant to a charge which the company had given over its assets. 11 On 22 April 2004 the first plaintiff was appointed as the liquidator of the company by a resolution of the creditors of the company.
 There was no evidence from the defendant in support of the existence of any arrangement between the company and any of the trade creditors to extend the time for the payment of its debt. 36 At the beginning of July 2003, the company had realisable assets of $287 125.39 --- comprising receivables, stock in trade and cash at bank.
 Those sources are not, in my view, therefore, to be characterised as 'realisable assets' of the company as at 1 July 2003. 37 Secondly, the overall financial position shows that at the time that the impugned payments were made the company was not suffering from a temporary liquidity problem but from an endemic and chronic shortage of working capital.
