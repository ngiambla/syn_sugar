 A LAW RELATING TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF FRAUDULENT DEBTORS? 12 Section 60(1)(a) empowers the Court to discharge an order made against Mr Sim only if the order of 10 July 2006 is made 'under any law relating to the imprisonment of fraudulent debtors'.
 I think that steps may be taken, as set out below, to better secure his cooperation and I do not assume that his desire to return to his home means that he will not in the future cooperate with his trustee in any event.
 Similar considerations apply to the enforcement and recovery process available in the event that the petition is dismissed. 34 I have also taken into account that Mr Sim is entitled to seek review of the orders of 10 July 2006 and 4 August 2006 under the Absconding Debtors Act .
 That is not to say that it was inappropriate to have instituted the proceedings in the NTSC under the Absconding Debtors Act --- that was a matter for CBFC and the CBA --- but simply to reject one explanation for having done so.
