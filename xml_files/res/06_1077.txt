 It is true that the Family Court would have had jurisdiction to hear the trustee's claim by reason of the order for transfer and the provisions of s 35A, but the Family Court would have had no power to make orders altering the ownership interests in the freehold property, leasehold property and speedboat if and once the trustee had brought the transfers within the provisions of s 120 or s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act .
 The Amending Act introduces s 59A which provides as follows: 'Sections 58 and 59 have effect subject to an order under Part VIII of the Family Law Act 1975 . ' 34 Section 116 of the Act defines the property which is divisible among the bankrupt's creditors and subsection (2) defines property that is not within that description.
 The Amending Act introduces a further paragraph to subsection (2) which is in the following terms: '(9) any property that, under an order under Part VIII of the Family Law Act 1975 , the trustee is required to transfer to the spouse of the bankrupt. ' 35 At the same time, the definition of maintenance agreement in the Bankruptcy Act (s 5(1)) for the purposes of s 120(2) and s 123(6) was amended to exclude from its terms a financial agreement within the provisions of the Family Law Act . 36 In addition to these changes in the substantive law, the Commonwealth Parliament has given the Family Court jurisdiction in bankruptcy, in addition to that which it may have on an order for transfer being made under s 35A.
