 A hearing of the application for an order to show cause was conducted pursuant to r 44.12 of the FMCR which confers a power upon the court to dismiss the application if the court is not satisfied 'that the application has raised an arguable case for the relief claimed'.
 An appeal lies from that order to the Federal Court of Australia pursuant to s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and s 24(1A) of that Act provides that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court that is an interlocutory judgment unless the court or a Judge gives leave to appeal.
