 Giles JA at [24] pointed out that where a valuer puts out a negligent valuation the class of persons to whom the duty of care "...will normally be confined, apart from any other considerations, to those persons whom the valuer knows or ought to know will reasonably rely on the valuation. " (Emphasis in original) In other words, given expectation of reasonable reliance, there can be a duty owed by a valuer to a class of persons.
 The identification of that class will obviously depend on the circumstances. 23 Perre , a decision of the High Court handed down shortly after Ta Ho Ma, demonstrates the flexibility and pragmatism of the law of negligence in identifying the class of persons to whom a duty of care is owed in a particular case and the absence of any bright line rule: see per Gleeson CJ at [7].
 The plaintiffs "were members of a class whose members, whether numerous or not, were ascertainable by (the defendant)": per McHugh J at [50]. 24 As I have said, it is arguable that in the present case there was an identifiable class constituted by clients of Boyds on whose behalf that firm was seeking the valuations in connection with some commercial dealing involving the specified properties. 25 The disclaimers are not conclusive if, as a matter of fact, the valuers must be taken to have expected that such clients of Boyds would reasonably rely on the valuations.
