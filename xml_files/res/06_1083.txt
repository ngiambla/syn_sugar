 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of Raphael FM of 10 April 2006, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made 18 November 2003 and handed down on 11 December 2003.
 The Tribunal found that this indicated that there is religious freedom in India and that state and federal governments generally take vigorous and active steps to put an end to communal violence.
 In light of the fact that these submissions were filed prior to the appellants stating and particularising their grounds of appeal, I sought the views of counsel for the first respondent as to whether the first respondent had in fact had an opportunity to respond to the appellants' grounds of appeal filed 28 July 2006.
