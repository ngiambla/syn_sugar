 The Tribunal was not satisfied on the information before it (including the applicant's protection visa application and the delegate's decision record) that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution, and accordingly affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa. 5 On 3 February 2006, the applicant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia seeking an order that the respondents show cause why a remedy should not be granted in respect of the decision of the Tribunal.
 His Honour was of the view that the Tribunal's decision was based on the insufficiency of information before it and that it did not make any adverse findings in relation to the applicant's claim that he was a Falun Gong practitioner.
