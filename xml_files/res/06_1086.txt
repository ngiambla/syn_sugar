 Principles applicable to the grant of an extension of time 10 Limitations of time in respect of filing and serving notices of appeal of decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court in the Federal Court are set out in O 52 r 15 Federal Court Rules .
 In my view, the brevity of the delay is a relevant factor to consider. 15 At the hearing before me, the applicant explained that his migration agent told him --- incorrectly --- that he needed to file the notice within 28 days of the decision of the Federal Magistrate.
 The applicant also claimed that the Tribunal applied an incorrect test of persecution for Convention purposes. 19 In a supporting affidavit filed 5 April 2006, the applicant recounted facts including his failed application for review to the Tribunal, and the fact that he lost his case before Driver FM.
 The applicant also noted that his migration agent had not lodged his amended application in the Federal Magistrates Court, although I note from the judgment of Driver FM that his Honour gave leave for a form of amended application to be filed in court ( SZHTW v Minister for Immigration Anor [2006] FMCA 356 at par 6).
