 The Federal Magistrate with respect correctly observed at [6] what follows as a matter of logic: 'there is no necessity for a state to provide protection to a person who is not being persecuted and so, in order for the Tribunal to be required to make an assessment of the availability of state protection, it has to be satisfied that there is something to protect the applicant from.
 In this case the Tribunal was unable to reach such a state of satisfaction, for the reasons expressed and set out herein and in the Tribunal's own decision . ' 13 The appellant did not clearly point to any relevant information before the Tribunal that would enable a finding of a state policy of tolerance or condonation of any persecution, even if it did exist.
 Accordingly, even if that did form part of the information upon which the Tribunal relied, the Tribunal was not obliged to disclose the response to the appellant. 19 The second way in which the appellant relies on s 424A(1) of the Act is the assertion that the Tribunal did not inform the appellant that it ' relied upon [the] finding of the Delegate '.
