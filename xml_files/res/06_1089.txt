 In this case the Tribunal was unable to reach such a state of satisfaction, for the reasons expressed and set out herein and in the Tribunal's own decision . ' 13 The appellant did not clearly point to any relevant information before the Tribunal that would enable a finding of a state policy of tolerance or condonation of any persecution, even if it did exist.
