 The 1996 income tax return of the Raftland Trust shows a distribution of its income of $779 705 and the return of the EM Unit Trust discloses income in that amount, which it offset against prior year tax losses.
 The nomination of the EM Unit Trust as a beneficiary of Raftland was only to effect these purposes and was therefore also a sham. 60 If the purported distributions to the EM Unit Trust were not effective, for any of the above reasons, the consequences are in dispute.
 Raftland is therefore liable to pay in accordance with s 99A. 61 Subsections 100A (1) and (2) also assumed relevance in the event that it is found that the EM Unit Trust continued in existence to the relevant time and there were distributions of trust income to it.
 In summary, s 100A(1) operates when the present entitlement of a beneficiary, to a share of the income of a trust estate, arose out of a reimbursement agreement or by reason of any act, transaction or circumstance that occurred in connexion with, or as a result of, a reimbursement agreement.
