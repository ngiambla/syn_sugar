 The vehicle by which the scheme is to be implemented is an Implementation Agreement of 14 March 2006 between Rocksoft and ADIC.
 Subsequently, ASIC was duly served with the order for the convening of meetings made on 19 June 2006 and the scheme booklet and other documents.
 Notice of today's hearing was also published in 'The Australian' newspaper on 15 July 2006 as required by the order of 19 June 2006.
 There is no suggestion that Rocksoft is not pursuing the scheme in good faith and for a legitimate purpose, namely the advancement of the interests of its members and option holders.
