 This followed a motion by the applicants in each case to strike out certain allegations in the Commissioner's Amended Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions as irrelevant. 2 The applicants are entitled to their costs of the proceedings.
 Issues raised by the Commissioner in them were not part of the objection decisions and are inconsistent with the income in question, being that of Raftland Pty Ltd, the applicant in Q173 of 202, the case which the Commissioner pursued.
 They allege that the Commissioner has not acted with propriety and that this is shown by the lateness of the concession. 3 I do not consider there is any evidence of impropriety.
 In the present case there are no matters in the Commissioner's conduct of the litigation which suggest that that course is appropriate. 4 There will be orders in each proceeding that the Commissioner pay the applicants' costs of the proceedings.
