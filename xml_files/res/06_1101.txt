 ASIC submitted that the verification of the debts required on affidavit by s 459Q was to the same standard as the verification of debts in the affidavit required to accompany a statutory demand for other than a judgment debt, pursuant to s 459E of the Act.
 The same statutory formula is used in relation to an affidavit verifying the existence of a debt for the purpose of an originating application as is used in relation to the affidavit backing a statutory demand.
 In the case of an affidavit backing a statutory demand, what is required is formal affirmation on oath that a certain amount of money is due and payable - Azed Developments Pty Ltd v Frederick and Co Limited (1994) 12 ACLC 949; Hamilhall Pty Ltd (In Liq) v AT Phillips Pty Ltd (1994) 54 FCR 173; Carb Royale Pty Ltd v Tonkin (2000) 18 ACLC 803.
