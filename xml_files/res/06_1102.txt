 The map notes that 'the local government area comprises the mainland and all islands above their respective sea-shores within the encompassed area' and that it '... includes the Australian islands above their respective lowest astronomical tides north of the seabed jurisdiction line'.
 Because the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim covers land and water seaward of the high water mark, the Council's local government area overlaps the claim area above the 'seabed jurisdiction line' and is adjacent to it below that line.
