 In addition the Registrar is to give notice containing details of the application to the various classes of persons or bodies set out in s 66(3) which include 'any local government body for any of the area covered by the application ...' (s 66(3)(a)(vi)).
 The map notes that 'the local government area comprises the mainland and all islands above their respective sea-shores within the encompassed area' and that it '... includes the Australian islands above their respective lowest astronomical tides north of the seabed jurisdiction line'.
 Because the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim covers land and water seaward of the high water mark, the Council's local government area overlaps the claim area above the 'seabed jurisdiction line' and is adjacent to it below that line.
 Statutory framework --- Island councils 20 Various of the islands in the Torres Strait have a form of local government authority on the island established as Island Councils pursuant to the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984 (Qld).
