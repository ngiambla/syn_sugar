 Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A ... a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a 'social group' and not a 'particular social group'. " THE PRESENT APPLICATION 4 When this matter was being prepared for trial the applicant was without legal representation.
 In other words, it is said that the Tribunal has confused the requirement that the group be identifiable (the first Applicant S question) with the requirement that it be distinguished from society at large (though what makes it identifiable and distinguishes it is the member's sharing of a characteristic or attribute. ) Objection likewise is taken to the Tribunal's insistence that the group alleged must have "some concrete manifestation".
 What it did not do was to answer that question. 9 After accepting that being convicted of a sexual offence on children may be a characteristic, it reasoned that that characteristic was not the matter that "makes the group identifiable".
 Few, though, of such groups will constitute "particular social groups" in the sense that the characteristic or attribute which individually identifies such groups, distinguishes the groups from society at large. 13 Because of what I infer was the Tribunal's erroneous analysis of the "group" requirement, it failed to address the principal issue before it which was whether, in India, the claimed group was a particular social group.
