 A full administration order required (and still requires, if one were to be made) accounts to be taken of the testator's debts, and of his property come to the hands of the representatives and an inquiry as to what part of his property was outstanding or undisposed of, and whether it was subject to incumbrances.
 Indeed, in McLean itself, although Young J ultimately did not make the (interlocutory) general administration order which had been sought in the proceedings before him, his refusal to do so depended in no sense upon a view that jurisdiction was lacking, or that an order for general administration could no longer be made by a court of equity. 9 In the proceedings before me, Mr Sifris argued that a proceeding for administration by the court, of either the traditional, general, kind or the more flexible and specific kind for which Pt 54 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Victoria provides, is the kind of proceeding to which s 244(13) of the Bankruptcy Act refers.
 While accepting, as I understood him, that the subsection did extend to proceedings for general administration or under Pt 54 , he submitted that the natural meaning of the words extended also to a situation in which someone had applied for a grant of probate, or for letters of administration, in relation to a deceased estate.
 He accepted that I should follow the judgment of another single judge of this Court unless I was persuaded that it was plainly wrong: see Cooper v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205, [46]; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SZANS [2005] FCAFC 41 ; (2005) 141 FCR 586, [38].
