 I will not repeat that background here. 2 On the day after I granted an injunction restraining Comandate Marine from applying to the English Courts for an order restraining Pan from bringing claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), Comandate Marine commenced new proceedings in rem in this Court and arrested the Boomerang I , a vessel which Pan had chartered.
 Heydon J, in the High Court of Australia, refused Comandate Marine's application for a stay of the Full Court's orders setting aside the writ in rem and refused to order a rearrest of the vessel Boomerang I , but granted expedition of the application for special leave to appeal which Comandate Marine had filed.
 Although Comandate Marine's proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings, they form, as I have held, part of the same 'matter' for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution , and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found.
