 The Migration Review Tribunal affirmed the decision, finding amongst other things that the report of a physician submitted by the appellant in support of his claim did not establish that he was unable to travel. 5 Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones dismissed an application for review of the decision of the MRT.
 However, the MRT did not "see this as exceptional and prohibitive in allowing the visa applicant to travel. " The decision of the Federal Magistrate 17 Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones referred at [21] of his judgment to the appellant's submission that the MRT did not have regard to all the medical reports and that it ignored relevant evidence.
 Reference was made to the decision of a Full Court in MZWBW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 94. 18 The learned Federal Magistrate also observed at [25] that the appellant knew exactly what he was required to prove and was given the opportunity of obtaining the evidence.
 The first ground is that the MRT failed to have regard in its reasons to important material going to an essential issue in the case. 20 The second ground is that the MRT failed to take into account relevant considerations, namely the existence of other medical evidence, in particular the report of Dr Dinakar dated 30 May 2004.
