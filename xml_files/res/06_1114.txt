 Exactech Inc, through its Australian distributor, Orthotech Pty Limited, has recently introduced into the Australian market a prosthetic knee called the Optetrak RBK. 2 Global claims that the distribution, promotion and marketing of the Optetrak RBK in Australia by Orthotech and Exactech constitute misleading and deceptive conduct.
 Many types of prosthetic knee products comprise initials and three letter abbreviations, and it is common practice in the industry to refer to products by their initials. 93 Global's RBK prosthesis is packaged in a number of very large boxes and tubs.
 Ordering and Implanting Prosthetic Knees 94 Generally, a surgeon instructs his/her receptionist or practice manager (if in private practice) or theatre or booking staff (if in a public hospital) to arrange purchase and delivery of the type and brand of knee to be implanted.
 The inventors of the LCS knee referred to it as a rotating bearing knee and Mr Ribot gave it that description when he was employed by DePuy. 102 Dr Rowden, a witness for Global, accepted that the LCS knee could be called a rotating bearing knee.
