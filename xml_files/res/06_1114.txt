 Exactech Inc, through its Australian distributor, Orthotech Pty Limited, has recently introduced into the Australian market a prosthetic knee called the Optetrak RBK. 2 Global claims that the distribution, promotion and marketing of the Optetrak RBK in Australia by Orthotech and Exactech constitute misleading and deceptive conduct.
 The inventors of the LCS knee referred to it as a rotating bearing knee and Mr Ribot gave it that description when he was employed by DePuy. 102 Dr Rowden, a witness for Global, accepted that the LCS knee could be called a rotating bearing knee.
