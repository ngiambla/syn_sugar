 Worimi contends, and the original Form 1 claimant application ('the original application') states, that the Port Stephens land is a sacred site for women, in the context of childbirth.
 The claim group of the proposed application is inconsistent with the claim group of the original application and cannot, therefore, be a sub-group of that original claim group.
 The inconsistencies between the proposed claim group and the original claim group, based upon the evidence of Worimi, a member of the proposed claim group, would seem unanswerable.
