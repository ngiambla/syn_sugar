 1 The appellant appeals from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed his application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.
 It found that the People's War Group would not consider the appellant to be a police informer, as he claimed it would. 5 The appellant's notice of appeal contends his Honour in the Court below erred in finding that the Tribunal's decision was not affected by a jurisdictional error.
 Having read the decision of the Tribunal, and the analysis of it in the Court below, I do not consider that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error in its consideration of the appellant's claim for a protection visa. 6 The appeal is dismissed with costs.
