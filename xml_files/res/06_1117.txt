 To one of those affidavits, a copy of the letter dated 5 July 2006 from Gilshenan Luton to The Company Secretary, Tanwing International Pty Ltd (ACN 106 121 868) was annexed, which stated that enclosed with the letter by way of service was an application and statement of claim by the applicant against the respondent in the Federal Court in respect of an alleged breach of patent.
 All these correspondences were annexed to an affidavit of Mr McCowan sworn and filed in Court today. 4 I am satisfied that the respondent was properly served with the application and the statement of claim, and was aware, at least through its current legal representatives, that the application for interlocutory relief would be heard today.
 The applicant submits that due to the conduct of the respondent significant additional costs in preparation for the interlocutory hearing have been incurred. 34 Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 provides: 'An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings in which the interlocutory order is made is concluded or further order. ' 35 I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate circumstance in which to order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith.
