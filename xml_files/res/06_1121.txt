 1 By application and statement of claim, each filed on 20 October 2005, the applicant Les Tissus Marey S A, a company incorporated pursuant to the law of France, seeks relief for breach of copyright against various respondents.
 It contends that the Lisa Ho respondents have, without the licence of the applicant, manufactured, distributed and sold garments which reproduce the copyright in the print, or authorised the carrying out of such conduct.
 The Lisa Ho respondents and Smouha take the view that a mediation as to liability ought to occur subject to the applicant confirming that a representative of the applicant with authority to settle the matter attend the mediation, and that it take place in Sydney.
