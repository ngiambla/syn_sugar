 He has practised as a sole practitioner since 1989 and, prior to that, was a partner with Coady Dwyer Associates. 32 Mr Dwyer recalled having been retained to set up a family trust for the bankrupt in the mid-1980s.
 That would obviate the need for any mortgagee consents, but not perfect a gift that had not been perfected in 1987. 56 In addition, the bankrupt contended that, in late 2004, he obtained duty assessments from the State Revenue Office ("the SRO") on the 1987 transfers.
 Although not strictly in evidence, I did have several documents marked for identification which suggested that the SRO had indeed assessed duty on the 1987 transfers, and that a cheque had been made out to the SRO by the bankrupt's wife for an amount of $6,614.00.
