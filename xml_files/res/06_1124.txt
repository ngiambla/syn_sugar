 The period specified in s 66 of the Act has expired and, after the end of that period, New South Wales Native Title Services Limited signed short minutes of order consenting to the determination sought by the applicant.
 I am also satisfied in accordance with s 86G of the Act that it is appropriate to make the orders without holding a hearing.
 A further reason why it is appropriate to make the orders is that the applicant brings the application on behalf of the local Land Council.
 This is not a case in which any previous native title has been extinguished by previous exclusive possession acts within s 23B or, otherwise within Division 2B of Part 2.
