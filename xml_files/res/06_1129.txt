 Accordingly, in the circumstances of the current proceedings, the Panel considers that the Undertakings are sufficient to address the unacceptable circumstances arising from the decision to consent to early dispatch and to ensure that there is an efficient, competitive and informed market for control of Tower. " 18 The undertaking had the desired effect, in the sense that it paved the way for a competing bid, a bid that would not otherwise have been forthcoming if effective control of Tower had passed to Pendant.
 It is a Superior bid because the offer made under the bid was for a cash price of more than $1.45 per share, the offer was sent to shareholders on 14 July 2006 and the offer became free of all conditions before 28 July 2006.
 Let it be further assumed that the offer is varied by increasing the offer price to, say, $1.60 and notice of that variation as required by s 650D of the Corporations Act is sent to shareholders on or before 14 July 2006.
 So, if the Panel committed a jurisdictional error in arriving at its decision that the undertaking proffered by Pendant rendered it inappropriate to make a declaration of unacceptable circumstances, it could still deal with the application.
