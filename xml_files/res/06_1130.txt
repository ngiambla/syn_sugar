 The Toohey Report also concluded that the Malak Malak had not established traditional ownership of that part of the claim area upstream of the Daly River Crossing that was historically Kamu land, but that the Kamu people as a group no longer existed. 5 Before the Deed of Grant was made, the Kamu made representations to the NLC.
 The NLC therefore established the Committee to make findings and recommendations in relation to the traditional ownership of the disputed part of the land contained within the Land Trust. 8 In June 1992, the NLC referred the dispute to the Committee 'to inquire into the question of who according to the ALRA are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the disputed part of the land trust'.
 It noted at [32] that the core Malak Malak people now are Albert Myoung and his five sisters, all of whom reside on the Land trust area and all of whom speak Malak Malak and know a lot about the area. 44 The Committee noted at [33] that the Kamu, the core element being Mrs Pan Quee's children and grandchildren, have since the Toohey Report sought to be recognised as the traditional Aboriginal owners of the eastern part of the Land Trust land.
 The long absence of the Kamu people from the land, the findings of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, the frustration of the Kamu people in seeking to achieve recognition and the apprehension of the Malak Malak has led to the development of what has been called a 'dispute'.
