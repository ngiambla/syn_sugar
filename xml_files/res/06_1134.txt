 Although it seems plain that someone sought to inhibit various football clubs from facilitating the marketing of the products by Cosdean in the critical period, it is not so clear that that inhibition emanated from or was engaged in by FFA.
 Counsel for FFA has also identified, by reference to the defence and the licensing agreements referred to, that there are some potential breaks in the line of authorisation which Cosdean may ultimately have to prove if it is to succeed in the proceedings.
 There is some evidence to indicate that, whoever was responsible for stultifying or impairing its capacity to sell the product at critical times, Cosdean was thereby restricted in a significant way from selling the product.
