 HIS HONOUR: 1 The unsuccessful applicant submits that there are two reasons for departure from the normal rule as to costs. 2 The first is that conduct of the applicant's case was unusually expensive because of onerous security restrictions imposed at the instance of the first respondent.
 I see no reason to deprive the successful party of his costs. 3 The second reason is that the case was likely to clarify and, subject to the appeal now launched, has clarified the law.
 In my view, the legal conclusion that I reached that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) had not excluded the necessity for procedural fairness for a non-citizen (as that term was used in my principal judgment) is likely to be of some general significance.
