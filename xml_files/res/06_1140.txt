 The Tribunal found that although the appellant was a supporter of the Awami League, he was not so politically prominent that he would have been vulnerable to persecution for political reasons during his time in Bangladesh.
 In the present case, it is clear from pars [37] and [43] of its reasons that the Tribunal relied on the appellant's statements in his original application in relation to his previous travels, and noted his failure to make a claim in that application that he had to travel covertly.
 At [175] - [180] , his Honour considered the meaning and significance of the expression "information", and in substance accepted that s 424A(1) required the Courts to draw a distinction between information put forward by an applicant during an initial interview for a visa application and information concerning the same claims given later during a hearing.
 As noted by the Federal Magistrate, the body of the application did not give more supporting material and assumed that the Tribunal would be receiving and considering all the documents which were before the delegate.
