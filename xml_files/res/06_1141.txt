 It is emphasised by the plaintiffs that the salved value of the ship and its cargo was considerable and that no alternative assistance was available when the vessel ran into difficulties.
 In fixing the reward in this case and carefully considering the criteria, I have taken into account the substantial agreed value of the salved property and treated it as an important consideration.
 When considering Article 13.1(d), it is useful to note that paragraphs (a) and (e) support the conclusion that the subject of the salvage operation is the "vessel and other property" salved.
