 It wholly encompasses Lambina Station, Welbourne Hill Station and Todmorden Station, and partially encompasses the Wintinna, Evelyn Downs, Arckaringa and Coorikiana pastoral leases. 4 The area described by the parties as the 'Marla Township', comprising the town of Marla as defined in the relevant Government Gazettes, the town's racecourse and the town's golf-course, is within the western portion of the determination area, but has been excluded from the proposed determination.
 At present, the Marla Township area is the subject of continuing negotiations between the parties. 5 The principal parties to the proceeding have now agreed that a determination should be made that native title exists in the claim area other than that part of the claim area comprising the Marla Township, and have negotiated the terms of a proposed consent determination.
 They now seek orders from the Court giving effect to the consent determination pursuant to Div 1C of Pt 4 of the Act. 6 The native title rights and interests articulated in the proposed determination are associated with non-exclusive possession of the land and waters in the determination area. 7 I consider that the proposed orders are within the power of the Court, and that it is appropriate in the circumstances to make them.
 A consent determination may be approved pursuant to s 87 , without holding a hearing, if the Court is satisfied that the proposed terms are within power, and if it appears appropriate to do so. 9 Because the proposed order involves making a determination of native title, the order must also comply with s 94A of the Act.
