 The respondent indicate to the applicant whether it consents to the filing of the proposed amended notice of appeal on or before 25 May 2006.
 The matter has proceeded in the normal way since this time, the applicant having filed an amended notice of appeal in substantially different form from the original notice of appeal.
 There are factual issues as to what occurred between the filing of the motion and 26 April 2006, including service or attempted service on the one hand, and what was done by the applicant by way of instructing a solicitor on the other.
 Although it is not critical to this decision, it is to be noted that there is no evidence that service occurred sufficient to entitle the respondent to proceed with the motion on 27 April 2006.
