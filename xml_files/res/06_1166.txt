 Suffice to say that the first scheduled hearing of 10 December 1999 and a second scheduled hearing of 21 March 2000 were not insisted upon by the Tribunal in view of the applicant's psychiatric difficulties which were raised by the applicant's adviser.
 The Tribunal, when dealing with the inability of the applicant to appear for the second scheduled hearing, refused a request that the matter be effectively stood over for a further period of about three months in order that the applicant's psychiatric position could be better assessed.
 I am not satisfied that this was a breach of s 425 of the Act for the reasons explained by Hely J in Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (NAHF) [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359, particularly at [25]---[30].
