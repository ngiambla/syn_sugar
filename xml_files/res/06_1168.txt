 I note the observations of Deane J in Parish (at 157) that: 'The interests of the administration of justice plainly make it desirable that obligations of confidence be not lightly overruled and that legitimate expectations of confidentiality as to private and confidential transactions and affairs be not lightly disregarded. ' 14 Further, I consider that any documents which contain information derived from documents subject to s 56 of the APRA Act should remain the subject of an order under s 50, except where that information is otherwise in the public domain.
 Further, only an interlocutory hearing has taken place, so the ultimate merits of the applicant's preliminary discovery claim have not yet been considered and much of the evidence filed in the proceedings has not yet been read in open court. 20 In Australian Competition Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 3) (2002) ATPR 41-873, Finkelstein J observed at [7]: 'The question that I must resolve is what principle should be applied when deciding whether to allow inspection in cases where leave is required.
 Accordingly, I am not satisfied that this should prevent leave being granted to access those affidavits. 29 Accordingly, subject to continuing publication restrictions arising from the order made under s 50 of the Federal Court Act, I propose to grant leave to the applicant media organisations to access those affidavits which have been admitted into evidence.
 The second part lists documents over which leave is granted if they are admitted into evidence. 30 In order that the parties may have an opportunity to consider the effect of these reasons, I propose to make these orders effective as from 4 pm on Tuesday 12 September 2006.
