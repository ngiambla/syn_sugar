 After providing two false reports in December 1999 and January 2000, the appellant said that in February 2000 he was called to the offices of the FSB, told that the FSB knew his reports were false, and detained and beaten for three days.
 The appellant says he was released on condition that he would provide truthful information about the Democratic Party to the FSB in the future. 4 The appellant claimed that in February 2000 he applied for an international passport and sought a visa for any western country.
 In his response to that letter, the appellant indicated that his authorised recipient (that is, migration adviser) was Michael Ryvchin of Rykono International Pty Ltd. 7 The appellant attended a hearing of the Tribunal on 6 August 2002, and was assisted by an interpreter.
 At that hearing the appellant claimed that he ' had no real understanding of what was happening between himself and the migration agent and the solicitor and that he should therefore have an opportunity of having his case heard ': see the judgment of Raphael FM at [5].
