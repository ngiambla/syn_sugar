 I note that his affidavit in support of the application does not explain why he did not attend before the Tribunal, or before the Federal Magistrates Court.
 The affidavit also asserts jurisdictional error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court in depriving the applicant of the right to be heard in person.
 He has not attended the Tribunal or the Federal Magistrates Court, or this Court in support of his claims, despite having been notified of them and despite having had the opportunity to do so.
