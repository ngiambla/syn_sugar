 As the applicant did not attend the Federal Magistrates Court hearing and his application was dismissed for non-attendance, there are no reasons of the Federal Magistrate dealing with the merits of his application.
 The Tribunal also rejected the applicant's claim that he would be persecuted for reasons of his real or imputed political opinion or his previous dealings with Jihadi organisations if he were to return to Pakistan.
 However, I am satisfied, upon consideration of the Tribunal's reasons, that there was no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal not accepting the applicant's claimed fear that those two persons may have told the Pakistani authorities, or people in general, about the applicant's claimed conversion.
 In the case of the other person, the applicant claimed that that he may have told the authorities of the applicant's interest in Christianity to save himself upon his return to Pakistan.
