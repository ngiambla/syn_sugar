 By Item 46 of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Medical Devices) Act 2002 (Cth) ('the TG Amending Act'), despite the repeal of s 17, goods that were ' included in [the ARTG]' prior to the TG Amending Act are taken to be included in the ARTG after its commencement.
 The distinction between listed goods and registered goods continues to apply in the TG Act, which now contains three parts --- listed goods, registered goods and medical devices included in the ARTG under Ch 4 (s 9A of the TG Act, inserted by the TG Amending Act).
 For pharmaceutical substances that had not received marketing approval, or approval to be imported into Australia for general marketing, prior to being included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods the first regulatory approval date is the date of commencement of the first inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.
