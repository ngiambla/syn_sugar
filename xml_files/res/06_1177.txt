 Mr Spalla argued that the Court should infer that, had such witnesses been called, their evidence would not have supported Mr Rambaldi's contention that the Deed was entered into on the understanding that it was an offer of settlement.
 Mr Rambaldi explained that he did not support the orders sought by the application because he did not believe that Mr Spalla was an appropriate person to have conduct of the Irlmond claim in the primary proceeding.
