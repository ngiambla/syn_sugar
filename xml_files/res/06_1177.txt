 Furthermore, neither of them was in dispute with Mr Borden, Ms Arslan or Mr Bowman. 25 Further, neither the Deloitte parties nor the St George parties submit that evidence of communications at the mediation between them and the applicants in the primary proceeding should not be given.
 Mr Spalla argued that the Court should infer that, had such witnesses been called, their evidence would not have supported Mr Rambaldi's contention that the Deed was entered into on the understanding that it was an offer of settlement.
 Mr Spalla argued that, as Irlmond had no assets other than its prospects of success in the primary proceeding, the creditors of Irlmond got nothing from the terms of settlement outlined in the Deed.
 Mr Rambaldi explained that he did not support the orders sought by the application because he did not believe that Mr Spalla was an appropriate person to have conduct of the Irlmond claim in the primary proceeding.
