 The point of distinction, of course, is that the report in issue in the present proceedings is clearly one which was communicated to the then solicitors for the respondent for the purpose of the conduct of the litigation.
 If the intention of the creation of the draft report was that it be communicated but, for some reason it was not in fact communicated, I do not think that its non-communication necessarily leads to the loss of the privilege which would otherwise attach to that document.
