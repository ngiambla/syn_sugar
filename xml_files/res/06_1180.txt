 His Honour, after quoting and adopting those principles, said: point made here is that privilege can only attach to documents which embody communication between the expert and the litigant by whom the expert is retained (or the litigant's lawyer).
 The point of distinction, of course, is that the report in issue in the present proceedings is clearly one which was communicated to the then solicitors for the respondent for the purpose of the conduct of the litigation.
 Even if it be accepted that a draft report prepared by an expert witness which is not communicated by the expert to the party's legal adviser is not privileged, this copy of the document, being the report as discovered, is accepted by the applicants as being a document commissioned by the respondent's former solicitor and communicated to those solicitors by the expert for the purposes of the litigation.
 If the intention of the creation of the draft report was that it be communicated but, for some reason it was not in fact communicated, I do not think that its non-communication necessarily leads to the loss of the privilege which would otherwise attach to that document.
