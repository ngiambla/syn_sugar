 The case of BHP Billiton was that none of the exemptions to the application of s 16(1) of the Workplace Relations Act as prescribed by s 16(2) and s 16(3) of that Act and the Workplace Relations Regulations were capable of applying to the proceedings.
 It was submitted to the Commissioner that the effect of s 16(1) was that the Workplace Relations Act was intended to apply to the exclusion of all State or Territory industrial laws and therefore to the exclusion of the Industrial Relations Act .
 The interlocutory relief sought is an interim order that until the hearing and determination of the application or until further order, the first and second respondents be restrained from listing the proceedings for hearing in the Commission.
 The application to the Commissioner under s 44 which might in future manifest as an appeal in the Industrial Appeal Court is not in respect of a decision to make or vary a State award.
