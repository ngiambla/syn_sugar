 An application may be made to this Court under Part 3 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') for a determination of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title (s 13(1)(a) of the Act).
 The NSW Minister for Land and Water Conservation, in his capacity as the State Minister pursuant to the Act, informed the Court on 17 January 2006 that he did not wish to be a party to the non-claimant application.
 The Court has jurisdiction to make a determination under s 61(1) of the Act that native title does not exist in relation to the land provided no prior approved determination of native title has been made (s 81, s 13(1)(a) and s 225 of the Act).
