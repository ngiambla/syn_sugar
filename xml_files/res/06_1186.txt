 Order 62 rule 4(2)(c) provides that where the Court orders that costs be paid to a party, it may further order that, instead of taxed costs, that party be entitled to "a gross sum specified in the order".
 The circumstances leading to the motion are described in the affidavits of Natalie Jean Hickey, a principal of Cadbury's solicitors, Jennifer Anne Young, a Mahlab Costing Pty Ltd costs consultant retained by Cadbury, and Janelle Suzanne Borham, a patent attorney of Griffith Hack, Cadbury's patent and trade marks attorneys.
