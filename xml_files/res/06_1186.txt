 By motion notice of which was filed on 3 August 2006 the respondent/cross claimant (Cadbury) seeks, under Order 62 rule 4(2)(c) of the Rules, an order that the applicant/cross respondent (Wrigley) pay $1,217,000 for Cadbury's costs and disbursements.
 Order 62 rule 4(2)(c) provides that where the Court orders that costs be paid to a party, it may further order that, instead of taxed costs, that party be entitled to "a gross sum specified in the order".
 The circumstances leading to the motion are described in the affidavits of Natalie Jean Hickey, a principal of Cadbury's solicitors, Jennifer Anne Young, a Mahlab Costing Pty Ltd costs consultant retained by Cadbury, and Janelle Suzanne Borham, a patent attorney of Griffith Hack, Cadbury's patent and trade marks attorneys.
