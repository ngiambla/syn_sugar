 The applicant claimed that she was kidnapped and kept under house arrest so the flag raising ceremony could not take place.
 The applicant said that when she was being held by those who kidnapped her, she was tortured and abused.
 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had come to public attention as either a student leader or an advocate for women's rights.
 This was because the Tribunal had found her claims of a well-founded fear of persecution were not made out.
