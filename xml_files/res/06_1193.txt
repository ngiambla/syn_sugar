 I referred also, in my earlier reasons, to the requirements for an affidavit verifying continuing debt in support of both a statutory demand and an application for a winding up for non-compliance with a demand where something other than a judgment debt is being relied upon.
 So far as the respondent's application for leave to issue subpoenas to ASIC is based upon an intention to raise a question as to whether the debts relied upon were due and payable, that is a matter which could have been raised in a challenge to the statutory demands.
 A presumption for which this section provides operates except so far as the contrary is proved for the purposes of the application. ' There is scope, other than by challenge to the debt set out in the statutory demand, for demonstrating the solvency of a company in opposition to a winding-up application.
