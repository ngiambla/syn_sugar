 They have submitted that I should revisit the finding I made in my judgment delivered on 12 May 2006, Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 3) [2006] FCA 602 , on the basis that the reformulated charge has elevated the sign depicted in order 1 made by Wilcox J on 15 December 2005 to the status itself of the trademarks, the protection of which was understood to be the object of order 1.
 The respondent submits that when one has regard to the fact that the concept employed by the parties in their consent orders eschewed the broader concept of deceptive similarity as explained in The Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia Limited) [1961] HCA 75 ; (1963) 109 CLR 407, it is at least open to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether what the respondent did, as previously found by me (in Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 3) [2006] FCA 602 at [12] ) was in fact a use that was the same or substantially identical with either of the registered marks. (The respondent does not accept that that finding was one which should have been arrived at on the facts, but has left such rights as he may have to deal with that matter to be the subject of an appeal rather than seeking leave to reopen generally. ) Today is the first occasion on which I have had the benefit of representation of the respondent by counsel.
 I am of the opinion that in the circumstances of the proceedings, the respondent has shown that there is a matter calling for review ( Smith v New South Wales Bar Association (1992) 176 CLR at 265 and Texas Company (Australasia) Limited v The Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1940] HCA 9 ; (1940) 63 CLR 382 at 457 per Starke J).
 Accordingly, in my view, it is appropriate for me to consider the argument now raised by the respondent for the purposes of reconsidering my finding, particularly as the respondent has sought to limit the basis of the review, notwithstanding that he maintains a position of wishing to challenge the factual findings that I have made in the event that an appeal is taken.
 In construing orders which are sought to be made on the subject of findings of contempt where later contraventions are alleged, it is permissible to have regard to any judgment given by the court pronouncing the orders and other relevant surrounding circumstances ( Athens v Randwick City Council [2005] NSWCA 317 ; (2005) 64 NSWLR 58).
 The respondent referred to the decision of Windeyer J in the Shell Co of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil (Australia Limited) (1961) 109 CLR at 414-415, where his Honour considered the concept of 'substantial identity' within the meaning of the then Trademarks Act 1955 (Cth) and the decided cases on those words, both here and in England, in contradistinction to the other concept used in the legislation of 'deceptive similarity'.
 He said that the judgment ought to be by eye alone for the purposes of determining substantial identity, but noted that in an animated depiction where matters do not stand still fleeting glimpses of substantial identity were not enough, although the position may be different with regard to deceptive similarity.
 Having now had the benefit of the argument put by the respondent, I am of opinion that the words 'substantially identical' as used in that order could be construed as denoting the concept in s 120 of the Trademarks Act 1995 (Cth) and as expounded in judicial decisions and that it is a reasonable construction of order 1 to read it in the way submitted by the respondent today.
 That is to say, the parties were identifying a limited legal concept as defining the extent of the protection that the order was seeking to give to the applicant's two trademarks and they accepted that the particular depiction, included as part of order 1, was an infringement of them.
 While that is not, for the reasons I have given in my earlier judgements, the construction which I would place on the words, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, having now reflected upon the new argument put by the respondent through his counsel today, that that is the only way one would read the consent orders in light of the heads of agreement which the respondent signed on 12 December 2005.
