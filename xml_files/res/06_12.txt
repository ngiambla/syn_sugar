 It involved cooperation with the INP "to support effective action against multi-jurisdictional crime"; it related to "illicit drug trafficking"; and it reflected the active fostering of a relationship with the INP involving "the provision and exchange of information ... consistent with AFP functions": Ministerial direction of 31 August 2004.
 Rather, it addresses the question whether the circumstances of Lee Rush's providing information to the AFP founded a reasonable expectation in Lee Rush that the AFP would not use, and an implied undertaking (though to whom is not stated) not to use, that information in a particular way.
 I equally assume that Scott Rush was to have been the beneficiary of the police action Lee Rush believed had occurred and that the police failure to speak to him before his departure to Bali denied him the opportunity to abandon his participation in the trafficking operation given its predictable consequence.
 Even if it be the case that AFP officers said they would act, or had acted, in a particular way towards Scott Rush at the airport and failed to do so, neither their representations and their failure to act nor the circumstances of the Myer-Patching conversations could give rise to a duty such as is alleged.
