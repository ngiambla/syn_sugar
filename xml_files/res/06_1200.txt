 Finally, the confidentiality provisions are silent on the question of legal advice; there is no evidence before the Court that the Bankers Trust documents would attract the operation of the confidentiality provisions.
 In particular, Mr Schoenberg deposes that Bankers Trust "wishes to maintain its claim for legal professional privilege over documents numbered 1434, 1444 and 1445 and has requested that the applicants maintain privilege in these documents" .
 It may be that a party to whom privileged documents are provided in circumstances that are not inconsistent with the maintenance of privilege, has a general or limited right to assert that privilege on behalf of that person.
