 It should be noted that the administrators, Huon and GE Commercial Corporation (Australia) Pty Limited ACN 000 974 747 (a secured creditor pursuant to a floating charge) have entered into a Deed of Funding and Consent, which has established a priority regime.
 In that respect, I would adopt the reasoning of Goldberg J in Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2001) 115 FCR 376 at [45] ---[46]. (See also Re Spyglass Management Group Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (2004) 51 ACSR 432; (2004) 23 ACLC 28 at [4]. ) I decline to give the direction sought.
