 It is their view that, if Huon cannot be sold as a going concern, it will very likely reduce the value the administrators can obtain for the assets which will, in turn, reduce the ultimate return available to creditors.
 This increase is payable in order to reflect the estimated additional operating expenses of running the Empire plant during the period of the Supply Agreement (cl 5.1). (4) In consideration of the customer agreeing to the Price Increase, Huon agrees to grant the customer a price rebate (Price Rebate) (cl 6.1).
 It should be noted that the administrators, Huon and GE Commercial Corporation (Australia) Pty Limited ACN 000 974 747 (a secured creditor pursuant to a floating charge) have entered into a Deed of Funding and Consent, which has established a priority regime.
 In that respect, I would adopt the reasoning of Goldberg J in Re Ansett Australia Ltd and Mentha [2001] FCA 1806 ; (2001) 115 FCR 376 at [45] ---[46]. (See also Re Spyglass Management Group Pty Ltd (Administrator Appointed) (2004) 51 ACSR 432; (2004) 23 ACLC 28 at [4]. ) I decline to give the direction sought.
