 However, the ground isolated in the draft order nisi attacked the decision of the Tribunal to affirm the refusal of the delegate of the Minister to grant the applicant a protection visa.
 The draft order nisi alleged that the decision was invalid as the Tribunal failed to afford the applicant/prosecutor natural justice because the applicant/prosecutor had not been given an opportunity (or at least an adequate opportunity) to prepare and present favourable material at hearing or an adequate opportunity to respond to unfavourable material.
 At no stage, either whilst he was represented or later, has the applicant been able to point to any material in the very detailed reasoning of the Tribunal that is based upon something of which he was not aware.
 It is submitted by counsel for the Minister that the Tribunal has in its reasons indicated in various places that adverse material was put to the applicant, and that is correct.
