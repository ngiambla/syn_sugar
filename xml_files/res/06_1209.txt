 Condition 8202 imposes enrolment and academic performance requirements on the holder of a student visa. 6 Mr Ting enrolled at the South Australian Institute of Business and Technology (SAIBT) in a course called a 'Mixed Program'.
 He contended that the basis of the notice under s 119(1) and for cancellation of his student visa was different from the contents of the s 20 notice because the s 20 notice 'did not mention the enrolment matter'. 13 Mr Ting also claimed that his unsatisfactory academic performance was because he had been put into a course which was too difficult for him.
 As the Federal Magistrate described it, the focus of submissions was really directed at the SAIBT for somehow having breached a duty of care to Mr Ting. 22 The Federal Magistrate did not consider that the contention that the SAIBT had somehow breached a duty of care owed to Mr Ting, even if established, would demonstrate jurisdictional error on the part of the Migration Review Tribunal.
 There is nothing to indicate that matter was put to the education provider before it issued its notice under s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth), or to the initial decision-maker, or to the Migration Review Tribunal.
