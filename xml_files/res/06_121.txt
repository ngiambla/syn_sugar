 In particular they contend that it is relevant to know whether the applicant produced a prototype of the CoStar stent "without undue experimentation or inventive ingenuity" and that this information may be gathered from reports that relate to the research, development or experimental work leading to the production of a workable prototype of the CoStar stent.
 I think that Ms Howard is correct when she says that the nature of the work undertaken by the applicant in developing its own prototype stent may (and I emphasis the word "may") be relevant to what work would be required by a person skilled in the art to make something within the claims.
