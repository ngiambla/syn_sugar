 A party's oath that a particular document was irrelevant (which would include an indirect statement imputed from the omission of a document from an affidavit of documents) was conclusive unless the court was reasonably satisfied from certain definite sources that the party had in his possession other relevant documents: Lyell v Kennedy (1884) 27 Ch D 1, 20.
 British Association of Glass Bottle Manufacturers, Limited v Nettlefold [1912] 1 KB 369 extended the sources to include any that contained an admission of the existence of a discoverable document. 2 Generally speaking, it was not possible to file a contentious affidavit to show that a party had not discovered all relevant documents: Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique v Peruvian Guano Company (1882) 11 QBD 55, 61.
 In particular they contend that it is relevant to know whether the applicant produced a prototype of the CoStar stent "without undue experimentation or inventive ingenuity" and that this information may be gathered from reports that relate to the research, development or experimental work leading to the production of a workable prototype of the CoStar stent.
 I think that Ms Howard is correct when she says that the nature of the work undertaken by the applicant in developing its own prototype stent may (and I emphasis the word "may") be relevant to what work would be required by a person skilled in the art to make something within the claims.
