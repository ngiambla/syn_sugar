 Austal is concerned that the report which came into Mr Thurlow's hands may have been obtained as a result of a breach of obligations of confidentiality on the part of Mr Merrigan and that its reproduction involved infringement of Austal's copyright in the report.
 As put in Austal's submissions, the key finding of the Austal Report was that the catamaran was, in effect, superior in terms of seakeeping when compared with the trimaran in this mathematical modelling.
 On 21 June 2006 Mr Craig Clifford, who is a Director or the Managing Director of a number of the Incat Group of Companies, sent an email to John Rothwell the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Austal.
 The offer of further investigation by Mr Clifford in the email sent to Mr Rothwell did not promise the kind of disclosure necessary for Austal to make the decision which it wants to make in relation to the institution of proceedings.
