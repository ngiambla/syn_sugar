 Promulgation of Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishing Management Plan ('the SESS Management Plan') --- Mr Rhodes' subsequent application for participation by way of grant or reinstatement of fishing permit under the auspices of the Plan --- decision or reconsideration decision of AFMA On 5 September 2003 the SESS Management Plan was promulgated under s 17 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 ('the Management Act') which empowered AFMA to establish 'plans of management for all fisheries' .
 AFMA put in issue to the Tribunal various aspects of Mr Rhodes' version of events and of the claims which he put forward, and in particular his assertion that his permit was cancelled without having been provided with an opportunity to respond to the threat or prospect of suspension or cancellation of his license.
 His initial request for review was said by AFMA to relate (in substance) to the absence of availability to him of a quota, and not to the cancellation of his permit or to the circumstance that he was unable to satisfy the quota allocation criteria based on his catch history between 1994 and 1997.
 AFMA pointed out that Mr Rhodes' '... new application, dated September 2003, was rejected because by then a "limited entry" policy was in force' , and contended that all of its decisions were lawfully made, '... and with ample opportunity for Mr Rhodes to make his case which he failed to do' .
