 1 This is one of three cases, heard together, which raise the same question for determination --- whether certain funds form assets of a company in liquidation for distribution in the liquidation of that company or whether those funds constitute an asset held pursuant to a terminated deed of company arrangement for the benefit of deed creditors.
 After those decisions, Finkelstein J, in Commonwealth of Australia v Rocklea Spinning Mills Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 902 ; (2005) 145 FCR 220, drew attention to the possibility of an inconsistency between them and the earlier decision of Davies J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v All Suburbs Car Repairs Pty Ltd (1994) 14 ACSR 753; (1994) 94 ATC 4712; (1994) 29 ATR 329.
 Davies J held that payments to the administrator were payments to him in his capacity as the agent of the company and consequently the sums received were the property of that company. 15 Barrett J needed to consider the differences in the reasoning in those authorities in Lombe v Wagga Leagues Club Ltd (2006) 56 ACSR 387; (2006) 24 ACLC 298; [2006] NSWSC 3 at [53] ---[77].
