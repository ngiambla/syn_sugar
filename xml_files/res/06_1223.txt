 1 This is one of three cases, heard together, which raise the same question for determination --- whether certain funds form assets of a company in liquidation for distribution in the liquidation of that company or whether those funds constitute an asset held pursuant to a terminated deed of company arrangement for the benefit of deed creditors.
 FACTS 2 I adopt in substance the summary by counsel for the plaintiffs of the material facts appearing from the evidence. 3 On 16 March 2005, Mr Purchas and Mr Malanos were appointed as the administrators of Worldwide Workers pursuant to s 436A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). 4 On 9 May 2005, a Deed of Company Arrangement (the DOCA) was executed pursuant to a resolution of the creditors in accordance with s 439C(a) of the Act at the meeting convened under s 439A of the Act . 5 The Deed Fund under the DOCA was constituted by cl 4 and cl 5 of the DOCA which provided for, inter alia, Worldwide Workers to pay certain funds to the administrators at certain times.
 Pursuant to cl 5 of the DOCA, the Retained Cash in the administration account as at the date of execution of the DOCA also formed part of the Deed Fund. 6 Clause 4.7(a) of the DOCA provided that: 'The Administrators shall hold the Deed Fund, upon trust, for the benefit of the Administrators and for those creditors who become Participating Creditors in accordance with the terms of this Deed. ' Pursuant to cl 4.7(b) of the DOCA, the monies paid by Worldwide Workers to the administrators were not refundable. 7 The administrators received certain amounts (including the sum of $220 932.00 by way of contribution from Worldwide Workers) in partial compliance with the DOCA. 8 The administrators did not make any payments by way of dividend to Participating Creditors under the DOCA. 9 On 29 June 2006, the creditors passed a resolution at a meeting convened pursuant to s 445F of the Act that the DOCA be terminated and Worldwide Workers be wound up.
 RELIEF SOUGHT 11 The substantive relief sought is as follows: (1) Directions pursuant to s 447D(2) and/or s 511 of the Act on the application and distribution of the Deed Fund as referred to in [23] of the affidavit of Ian James Purchas pursuant to the Deed of Company Arrangement entered into by the defendant dated 9 May 2005. (2) A declaration, pursuant to s 447D(2) and/or s 511(2) of the Act, that the Deed Fund is to be distributed to the Participating Creditors on the terms set out in the Deed of Company Arrangement entered into by the defendant dated 9 May 2005. (3) Alternatively, a declaration, pursuant to s 447D(2) and/or s 511(2) of the Act, that the Deed Fund is available for distribution as part of the property of the defendant in the due course of the winding up of the defendant in accordance with the relevant provisions of Pt 5.6 of the Act.
