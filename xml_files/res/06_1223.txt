 Pursuant to cl 5 of the DOCA, the Retained Cash in the administration account as at the date of execution of the DOCA also formed part of the Deed Fund. 6 Clause 4.7(a) of the DOCA provided that: 'The Administrators shall hold the Deed Fund, upon trust, for the benefit of the Administrators and for those creditors who become Participating Creditors in accordance with the terms of this Deed. ' Pursuant to cl 4.7(b) of the DOCA, the monies paid by Worldwide Workers to the administrators were not refundable. 7 The administrators received certain amounts (including the sum of $220 932.00 by way of contribution from Worldwide Workers) in partial compliance with the DOCA. 8 The administrators did not make any payments by way of dividend to Participating Creditors under the DOCA. 9 On 29 June 2006, the creditors passed a resolution at a meeting convened pursuant to s 445F of the Act that the DOCA be terminated and Worldwide Workers be wound up.
