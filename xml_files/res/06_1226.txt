 Section 6(3)(a) expressly provides for a magistrate concurrently holding another public or judicial office or appointment, including one 'made under the law of another place', whereas in s 6(3)(b) there is no reference to 'the law of another place' in relation to the concurrent performance by magistrates of 'other public functions'.
 I also accept the submissions of the first and third respondents that, even if the validity of s 19 and s 46 of the Act depended upon the existence of State legislative 'consent and authority', such consent and approval is to be found in s 6(3)(b) of the Magistrates Court Act.
 I am of the view that on the application of the criteria recognised by the High Court in Wilson , the administrative functions which are performed by a magistrate acting as a designated person in relation to s 19 proceedings are not such as would offend the constitutional incompatibility principle.
