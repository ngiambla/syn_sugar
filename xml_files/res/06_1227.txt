 It was said that if Merck's position was accepted, what Merck did after the grant was not relevant, so documents relating to experiments after that date should be excluded from discovery.
 The question of whether or not the promise was fulfilled depended upon objective scientific facts (for example, whether a reaction was to be conducted at certain temperatures), such that the date at which such facts are proved or disproved was irrelevant.
 The documents Merck may have which existed at the time of grant and which might tend to establish (or raise doubts about) the usefulness of the process are appropriate to be discovered.
