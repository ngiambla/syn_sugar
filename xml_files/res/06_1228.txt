 His Honour noted that "There was no evidence that a court order existed that entitled the applicant to access the children" (at [9]). 37 However, his Honour should not necessarily be taken to have excluded the possibility that something less than a court order could establish "access".
 His Honour noted that at all relevant times the sponsoring spouse was under a statutory obligation to maintain her child, and concluded that such obligation constituted a "formal maintenance obligation". 45 Dowsett J was mindful of the apparent inconsistency with Sundberg J's decision in Yazbeck and discussed that decision at some length, at [30] to [38].
 Prior to considering the decision in Yazbeck , Dowsett J considered the meaning of "residence order", "contact order" and "child maintenance order" used in items (B), (D) and (E), and notes that the terms were introduced by the 1995 amendments to the Family Law Act .
 Dowsett J observed that an approach to items (A) and (C) as counterparts seemed to assume that only the visa applicant and sponsor had any direct interest in the relevant child, whereas there was no reason to assume this, especially since there was no requirement that the child be the biological child of either person.
