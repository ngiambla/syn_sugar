 In performing that review it had power to exercise all of the powers and discretions that were conferred by the Act on the person who made the decision (s 349). 21 I am of opinion that the Tribunal did not, in its reasons for decision, set out the evidence or any other material on which the ultimate findings of fact to which it came in relation to cl 845.216 were based.
 In Minister for Immigration v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 20 [38] Gummow and Hayne JJ said that: '...the critical question is whether the determination was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant 20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 67 [37], 71 [52], 98 [173]).
 That is not to say that another tribunal could not come to the same decision, but if it did so it would have to apply the law correctly, make findings and give reasons which were capable of supporting the decision. 36 The question then is whether the error that I have found in the Tribunal's decision amounts to first, a jurisdictional error, and even if it does, whether I should grant relief in respect of it.
 The Tribunal did not make any finding to suggest that the appellant's ability to read and understand English texts about familiar topics had been established to any level before it. 50 It follows that the Tribunal's ultimate finding, that it was not satisfied that the appellant had functional English, was open to it on the material before it.
