 I hope I do not do injustice to the relevant parts of the Points of Claim by identifying the relevant issues for present purposes as being: (1) Whether the second respondent properly considered the making of the 2003 Determination and the other Determinations because there is some evidence that they were all made within the space of a few minutes on 15 May 2003, and that also in reality they were made on 13 May 2003.
 The point is simply that issue on the pleadings is a live one. 14 The respondents contend nevertheless that the additional documents sought are not relevant so that they should not be ordered to be discovered. 15 In respect of the contents of the other Determinations, I accept that submission.
