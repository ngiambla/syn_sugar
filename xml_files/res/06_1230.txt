 I hope I do not do injustice to the relevant parts of the Points of Claim by identifying the relevant issues for present purposes as being: (1) Whether the second respondent properly considered the making of the 2003 Determination and the other Determinations because there is some evidence that they were all made within the space of a few minutes on 15 May 2003, and that also in reality they were made on 13 May 2003.
 The ACC has received advice that such a misdescription does not affect the validity of the instrument. ' (2) Whether the 2003 Determination, and consequently its amendments, are invalid because the 2003 Determination was not made on 15 May 2003 as appears on its face, and because there is evidence that the consideration of the second respondent on the occasion of the making of those determinations involved their authorisation pursuant to s 7C(1)(c), but not a determination that they should be special investigations, pursuant to s 7C(3) of the ACC Act.
 DISCOVERY 11 As I have indicated I propose to vary the discovery order made on 30 May 2006 to make it clear precisely what I intended to order to be discovered. 12 The remaining issue concerns discovery of the other Determinations and the minutes of the second respondent to the extent to which they record the fact of the making and the time of the making of the other Determinations and the time taken in their consideration. 13 I must decide that issue by reference to the Points of Claim and the Points of Defence.
 The point is simply that issue on the pleadings is a live one. 14 The respondents contend nevertheless that the additional documents sought are not relevant so that they should not be ordered to be discovered. 15 In respect of the contents of the other Determinations, I accept that submission.
