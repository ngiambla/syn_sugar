 The civil action in the Supreme Court of Western Australia The civil action in the Supreme Court of Western Australia was commenced between Norilya (then Noranda) and the prospectors on 14 August 1990 by writ of summons.
 This had occurred with the creation of the Noranda option on 8 June 1990 and the subsequent exercise of that option in which the sum of $6 million was paid by Norilya to the prospectors and $150,000 to Acarus pursuant to the Noranda option.
 The Court held by majority that a statutory claim for unliquidated damages for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the claimant to make a contract with some party other than the bankrupt but not with the bankrupt is not a provable debt for the purposes of s 82.
