 On review in the Tribunal the proceedings related to this decision were numbered N2003/1596 and on appeal to this Court NSD 1857 of 2005. (iii) A decision dated 20 April 2004 in which the Authority suspended the respondent's registration pursuant to s 303(1)(b) of the Act as it was satisfied that the respondent had not complied with the Code of Conduct prescribed under s 314 --- see s 303(1)(h) ('the suspension decision').
 The Tribunal also noted that the respondent's applications under s 417 were defective in that they did not address the relevant criteria, which the Tribunal found as relevant to his fitness to be a migration agent (at [110]). (10) The Tribunal was critical of the respondent's approach that it was his job to state the facts and for the Department to link the facts to the law.
 Where the decision is to refuse an entitlement, the point in time is the date of the Tribunal's decision, and where the decision is to cancel an entitlement, the Tribunal is limited to considering the state of affairs as it existed on the date of the decision under review. 26 The respondent submitted that critical to the Court's reasoning in Freeman was that in that case the Tribunal had affirmed the decision under review to cancel the applicant's pension.
 That is how the Court can readily conclude that the Tribunal has erred in its application of the law to the facts in this case. 71 The Authority then turned to address the respondent's submission that the Act and the Code envisage that an agent who is not competent in certain areas of practice as a migration agent can nevertheless be fit to be an agent.
