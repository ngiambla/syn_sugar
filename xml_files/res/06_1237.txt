 On 22 April 2005 the applicant lodged a notice of objection against the FTL penalty decision and sought further time to forward grounds of objection.
 On 31 May 2005 the respondent disallowed the applicant's request for further time, again because returns had still not been lodged for the years of income.
 At the time of the hearing the applicant had still not lodged the returns for 2001 and 2003, although she stated that she intended to do so within the near future.
