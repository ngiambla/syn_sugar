 It raises for determination whether certain members of the applicant, Australian Nursing Federation, have been incorrectly paid by their employers for work performed on Monday 27 December 2004, Tuesday 28 December 2004 and Monday 3 January 2005. 2 The second respondent, Ellfam Nominees Pty Ltd, is the operator of Aged Care Facilities at Bendigo and Ballarat.
 Kaye Young did not receive any payment for those days. 7 ANF contends that Ellfam should have paid Kevin Wright, Ellen Lea and Kaye Young for work performed by them on Monday 27 December 2004, Tuesday 28 December 2004 and Monday 3 January 2005 at public holiday rates.
 Those days include 27 December, 28 December and 3 January, which are "set out" in sub-cl 24.2. 26 Counsel for the ANF submits that the Court should not interpret sub-cl 24.4 literally because sub-cl 24.2 only applies to Monday to Friday nurses.
 However, anything but a literal meaning would give rise to an unintentional windfall for nurses who do not work on a Monday to Friday basis, in respect of Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day or holidays in lieu of these days for the reasons explained at [26] above.
