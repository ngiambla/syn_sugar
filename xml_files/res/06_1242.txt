 They relate to an Option held by Bowesco and purportedly assigned to it by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd (Westpoint Corporation) in respect of land occupied by the Warnbro Fair Shopping Centre and land adjacent to it.
 Bowesco contended that the assignment of the Option was part of the ordinary course of Westpoint Corporation's business and that the Option, as an asset of Bowesco, was not the subject of the fixed part of the charge.
 Conclusion For the preceding reasons, in my opinion, I should accede to the motion by the Option Receivers and make a declaration that the charge at the time it was created applied to the Option as a fixed charge.
