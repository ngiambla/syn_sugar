 However the Tribunal had found, by reference to the independent information in evidence available at the time of decision-making compiled some six years after the appellants had left Bangladesh, 'that the circumstance [in Bangladesh] had changed to the extent that the party [of] which [the first appellant] claim [s] to be a supporter was now in government'.
 Nicholls FM observed that the Tribunal relied on the inconsistencies in the appellants' claim in its reasons for decision rather than the information contained in the visa application and that 'in the alternative that even if [the first set of reasons] of the Tribunal's decision did not contain jurisdictional error, it did not have necessary consequence in the ultimate decision to affirm the delegate's decision, because of other independent reasons given for affirming the delegate's decision' .
 The appellants submitted in any event that 'on the basis of the following principles, an examination of the sets of reasons shows that all three sets of reasons forming the parts of the reasons for affirming the decision of the Tribunal are affected by [a] breach of s 424A', the appellants thereby referring to the reasons I have reproduced at length in [24] above.
