 So, I do not consider that it will suffer some substantial prejudice by being required to adhere to the position that there is no arbitration currently on foot by reason of the determination that I made on 22 August 2006. 24 This is an application to commence an appeal in commercial litigation which ought be approached commercially in the exercise of discretions attending a grant of leave.
 The orders that I would make would be orders affecting Comandate Marine as a party to proceedings before this court and in the protection of the processes of this Court and the rights of the parties before me. 26 One potential consequence of refusing leave to appeal in weighing the prejudice that Comandate Marine might suffer, is that it would lose the benefit of the arbitration were it entitled to proceed.
 If Pan is obliged to give security to put Comandate Marine in funds to obtain first the discharge and later the restoration of those orders, in the event that the appeal is allowed, any injustice to Comandate Marine on a practical level will be undone because it will then be able to regain orders that it can enforce in the future.
