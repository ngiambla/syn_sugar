 Under cover of a letter dated 15 February 2005 the applicant's solicitors returned a 'Request for Hearing' form to the Tribunal confirming that the applicant proposed to appear before the Tribunal and requesting that the Tribunal take oral evidence from his wife.
 Therefore pursuant to s 360(2)(c) the review applicant is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal and pursuant to s 363A cannot be permitted to do so. ' 15 The Tribunal further advised that it had made its decision based on the documentary material which it had received.
 The allegation of error is founded on the assumption that the 18 April 2005 letter recorded an exercise of the Tribunal's power under s 359B(4) of the Act, to enlarge time within which to provide the information sought in its letter of 28 February 2005. 48 In my view a fair reading of the Tribunal's letter makes it plain that no such exercise of power was involved.
 ALLEGED ERROR (e) 53 The applicant contends that, even if the Tribunal lacked power to invite him to attend an oral hearing, it nonetheless retained a discretion to invite his wife to attend and give evidence in support of his application.
