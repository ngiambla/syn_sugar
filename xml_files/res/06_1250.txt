 A strict application of O 53 r 3(4) would render the questions unarguable without the leave of the Court. ' Relevant Legislation 9 Section 44(1) of the AAT Act provides: '(1) A party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding. ' 10 In the case before me, O 53, subrules 3(2) and (3) of the Federal Court Rules are also relevant.
 In Ergon , while the question was not framed as such as a 'question', nevertheless a particular issue of law specific to that case was clearly posed. 17 During the hearing, Mr Looney submitted that it was sufficient for a question of law to be a question of law within the meaning of s 44, if it was drafted as a question which on its face contains, for example, an error of law within general administrative law principles.
 Mr Looney submitted that it would satisfy s 44. 18 In my view that cannot be the case. 20 Further, it is not, in my view, a question of law to include a 'catch all' submission referable to questions of law in pars 2(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), as a question of law which is the subject of the appeal.
 I note similar comments in the context of the notice of appeal in Saxby Bridge at par 47 of that judgment. 22 Accordingly, I am prepared to give leave to allow the notice of appeal to be amended in accordance with the amended notice of appeal attached to the applicant's further amended notice of motion filed in Court on 18 September 2006, subject to deletion of par 2(g) of that document.
