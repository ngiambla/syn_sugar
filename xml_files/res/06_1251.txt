 I refer in particular to those parties to whom exploration permits had issued and who may have been parties to whom the right to negotiate provisions (Subdivision P, Division 3, Part 2 NTA) applied had the claim been registered by the delegate.
 I maintain that view. 4 In Strickland v Native Title Registrar [2000] FCA 10 French J expressed the view, in unqualified terms, that s 190D did not authorise an order having retrospect of effect.
 For all practical purposes, however, it proceeded as an application for review under s.190D. ... [11] In my opinion, s.190B of the Act does not authorise the Court to direct the Registrar to make an entry in the Native Title Register which is, in effect, backdated to 8 June 1999.
 The effect of s 28(1)(a) for present purposes, is that if there is no native title claimant registered at the end of a period of four months following notification an act will not be invalid.
