 1 The applicant (Mr Conley) applies for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal from a judgment of a judge of the Court on 4 July 2006 that a sequestration order be made against his estate ( Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Conley, in the matter of Conley [2006] FCA 1011).
 However, Mr Conley asserts that the Bank would have been aware from previous proceedings against it in the District Court of New South Wales ('the District Court proceedings') that he intended to commence the Supreme Court proceedings. 12 This matter has a complex litigation history which need not be set out here.
 While his Honour did not refer in detail to the evidence before him, he was satisfied that there ' is a bona fide dispute that Mr Conley could raise in litigation to contest the exercise of the power of sale ' (at [5]).
 The only reference to a possible abuse of process that the parties identified in the transcript of the proceedings before his Honour is a statement made by Mr Conley in the context of a discussion of the effect of the bankruptcy on him.
