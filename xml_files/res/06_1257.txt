 By a decision of 31 March 2005 a delegate of the First Respondent determined, following a medical reassessment, both physical and psychological, that payment of the disability support pension was no longer warranted as Mr Croker was insufficiently impaired to meet the test for its grant.
 It reached different conclusions to the delegate and the authorised review officer about the existence and character of his medical conditions but this did not ultimately result in a higher impairment rating which would justify the grant, or continuation, of a disability support pension.
 The decision of the AAT under challenge involved the exercise of a discretion with respect to an interlocutory application in circumstances where the appeal which is pending before the AAT will deal with the substance of the matters which Mr Croker wishes to agitate.
 There is no substance to the bald allegation, which Mr Croker was unable to develop further, that the jurisdiction of this Court under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) provided the foundation for any relief in the circumstances of this case.
