 Section 191(2)(c) provides that an application for confirmation of a scheme may not be made unless an approved summary of the scheme has been given to ' every affected policy owner '. 3 While the question is not free from authority to the contrary (see Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450 at [19] ), it is assumed for the purposes of the applications that ' affected policy owner ' as defined by the Act includes policy holders of both the transferring (Lifetime and National) and receiving (MLC) funds. 5 The principles to be applied in applications for dispensation such as this one have been referred to in a number of cases.
 I also note that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has informed the Court that, in the case of each scheme, it does not oppose the orders for dispensation sought by the applicants. 8 As to the applications for dispensation affecting the MLC policy holders, the evidence is that the cost of mailing of scheme summaries to those holders is expected to be between $435,000 and $655,000.
 While that does not represent a large percentage of the funds under consideration, it is a substantial sum of money. 9 I am satisfied that it is appropriate to grant the dispensation from the requirement to send those summaries. 10 Secondly, the applicants seek dispensation from the requirement to give summaries of the schemes to Lifetime and National policy holders of unknown address.
 There has been detailed evidence adduced as to the numbers of holders affected and the steps taken to ascertain the addresses of those for whom no record of a current address is held. 11 Both Lifetime and National will continue to exist after the scheme is implemented and calls or correspondence addressed to them will be forwarded to the administration team of the MLC receiving fund.
