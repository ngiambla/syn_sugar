 It is clear that the Tribunal answered this question in the negative but the process of reasoning which led the Tribunal to its negative answer is not clear. 11 Mr Koosasi drew attention to the evidence before the Tribunal which showed that, as at the date of the cancellation decision, Great Bamboo had exported Australian goods (see the outcome identified in (c) of the definition of 'eligible business' ).
 Alternatively, the respondent submitted that the Tribunal found both that the business of Great Bamboo was not resulting, and would not result, in one or more of the outcomes identified in (a)-(f) of the definition of 'eligible business' . 13 It is thus necessary for this Court to determine by reference to all of the material before it which is capable of throwing light on the proper understanding of the Tribunal's reasons for decision, what process of reasoning led to the Tribunal's conclusion that Mr Koosasi's substantial ownership interest in Great Bamboo did not constitute a substantial ownership interest in an 'eligible business' . 14 The material before this Court includes the respondent's statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal.
 The respondent's statement of facts and contentions before the Tribunal argued that Mr Koosasi's business did not appear 'to have been carried out on an ongoing or repetitive basis' . 15 At [28] the same document advanced the alternative contention that Great Bamboo was not an eligible business because it did not meet any of the requirements listed in the definition of 'eligible business' in s 134(10).
