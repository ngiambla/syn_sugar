 However the Court will not entertain such an application if the amendment is obviously futile or untenable or would cause substantial injustice which cannot be otherwise compensated, such as by an order for costs. 2 The proposed cross-claim is not in proper form and is confusingly drafted.
 It is alleged that the Registrar, in accepting the trade mark application, made errors of law, acted beyond jurisdiction, made decisions that were not authorised and exercised the power improperly or in a way that resulted in an uncertain exercise of power. 5 These claims seem to be an alternative way of putting the basic grievances concerning the Registrar's decision to register the trade mark.
 I doubt very much whether an application under the ADJR Act can be used to seek the cancellation of a trade mark when there is a direct avenue for that remedy under s 88 of the Trade Marks Act : see Mark Foys Pty Ltd v TVSN (Pacific) Ltd [2000] FCA 1626 ; (2000) 104 FCR 61 at 78-79 [63] - [66] . 6 There are other reasons for thinking that the ADJR Act application is untenable in its present state.
