 I have been referred to a number of authorities dealing with the issue of agency and authority, including Hanley v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 1188 ; (2000) 100 FCR 530 and Yallourn Energy Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] VSC 479.
 They are matters which I cannot finally determine or attempt to determine for the purposes of this interlocutory application. 17 I am not in a position to determine, as I have said, the exact involvement of the officers of the respondent, but I am of the view that, on the current material in relation to the officers' involvement, the case is not a strong one against the respondent.
