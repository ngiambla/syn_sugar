 1 The following are my reasons for the orders made on 28 August 2006. 2 The applicant ("Cadbury") appeals to the Court under s 60(4) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ("the Act ") against a decision of a delegate of the second respondent ("the Delegate" and "the Commissioner" respectively) given on 30 September 2002 concerning an Australian Patent Application Number 706901 ("the Patent").
 By the decision, the Commissioner, by the Delegate, allowed the opposition of the respondent ("Effem") to the grant of the Patent, and awarded costs against Cadbury. 3 The Patent application was filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty on 21 December 1995 under International Application Number PCT/GB95/03010.
 With her consent, I ordered that she be added as second respondent. 11 In the light of the above developments, no evidence was adduced on the hearing of the appeal in support of any ground of opposition. 12 An appeal under s 60(4) of the Act is a proceeding in the original jurisdiction of the Court, and is in the nature of a hearing de novo.
 None of the evidence in support of the opposition that was before the Delegate was before the Court. 13 Cadbury submitted that the onus rested on Effem to establish that, if granted, the Patent would be clearly invalid: F Hoffman-La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc [2000] FCA 283 ; (2000) 99 FCR 56 at [48] - [67] . 14 Cadbury further submitted that in the circumstances, it was not required to adduce any evidence to counter the ground of opposition that succeeded before the Delegate or any other ground of opposition. 15 Recently, in European Community v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 706 , Young J dealt with a similar submission made in similar forensic circumstances.
