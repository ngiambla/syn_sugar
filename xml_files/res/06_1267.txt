 1 The following are my reasons for the orders made on 28 August 2006. 2 The applicant ("Cadbury") appeals to the Court under s 60(4) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ("the Act ") against a decision of a delegate of the second respondent ("the Delegate" and "the Commissioner" respectively) given on 30 September 2002 concerning an Australian Patent Application Number 706901 ("the Patent").
 By the decision, the Commissioner, by the Delegate, allowed the opposition of the respondent ("Effem") to the grant of the Patent, and awarded costs against Cadbury. 3 The Patent application was filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty on 21 December 1995 under International Application Number PCT/GB95/03010.
 The process involves controlling the milling of the solid ingredients to produce particles of a specific "particle size distribution," in which the proportion of ultrafines is kept to such a level that the addition of water is not required. 5 Effem's grounds of opposition were: 1. lack of novelty; 2. obviousness; 3. not a method of manufacture; 4. non-compliance with s 40 of the Act .
 With her consent, I ordered that she be added as second respondent. 11 In the light of the above developments, no evidence was adduced on the hearing of the appeal in support of any ground of opposition. 12 An appeal under s 60(4) of the Act is a proceeding in the original jurisdiction of the Court, and is in the nature of a hearing de novo.
 His Honour referred to Caroma Sales Pty Ltd v Philmac Pty Ltd (1972) 46 ALJR 324 per Walsh J; Brickwood Holdings Pty Ltd v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [1983] 2 VR 587 at 588-589 per King J; and Titan Mining Engineering Pty Ltd v Arnall's Engineering Pty Ltd (1988) 12 NSWLR 73 at 75-76 per McLelland J. 16 I have read those authorities, but will not review them. 17 It is important to note that in the light of the history of the application, and, in particular, the Commissioner's acceptance of the application and the complete specification, s 61 of the Act would have obliged the Commissioner to grant the Patent if there had been no opposition to the grant.
 In substance, that is now the position on the appeal. 18 The appeal should be allowed, the Commissioner's decision allowing the opposition should be reversed, and the Patent application should proceed to grant. 19 Notwithstanding his submission that it was not incumbent on Cadbury to lead any evidence addressing any ground of opposition, in order to provide some "comfort" to the Court, Mr Burley, of counsel for Cadbury, did read an affidavit of Michael Kenneth Payne of the British Library Document Supply Centre, demonstrating that document D10 was in fact received by the British Library Document Supply Centre on 3 August 1998 --- well after the priority date. 20 The making of the orders foreshadowed above will not, of course, foreclose the question of the validity of the Patent in any future proceeding, such as a proceeding for revocation of the Patent.
