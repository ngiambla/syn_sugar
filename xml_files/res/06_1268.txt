 No qualification was placed upon the information contained in the documents. 120 Mr Moore, and indeed Mr and Mrs White and thereby the first applicant, were entitled to rely upon the representations inherent in the documents themselves.
 I further find that the applicants believed and relied upon the representations that the business was capable of continuing to generate a gross profit in the order of the gross profit achieved in the year ended 30 June 1999 and the net profit in the sum generated in the same year.
 The opening and closing stock in the taxation profit and loss statement is the same as the closing stock in the Moore 1997 profit and loss statement and the closing stock in the Moore 1998 profit and loss statement.
