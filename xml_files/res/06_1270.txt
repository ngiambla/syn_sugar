 The licence is subject to a condition that by that date, a body known as the State Reserves Committee of the Ukraine, a Ukrainian government body, should have approved the reserves of the gold deposit, in the sense that, it should have approved the categorisation of, the volume of and grade of the ore body or bodies at the Saulyak gold deposit. 6 The evidence of Mr Gunzburg is that the Transcarpathian Geological Expedition, which is a Ukrainian government geological survey, classified the gold reserves at Saulyak gold deposit as equivalent to 578 000 ounces of contained gold at a cut-off rate of 1.5 grams per ton in the former Soviet C1 and C2 categories.
 The first applicant's statement said that the applicants had not sought an extension of the Saulyak licence, the licence is not due for review until November 2007, and progress under the approved work programmes is regularly reviewed by the authorities. 25 Accordingly, the statement which was published to the stock exchange contains both an allegation made by the respondents and a rebuttal by the applicants.
 There is in Mr Gunzburg's affidavit of 4 August 2006, evidence from which inferences can be drawn, that the respondents were, as a consequence of due diligence investigations they had carried out, made aware before entering into the Sale Agreement, of the status of Ukrainian government approvals in relation to the exploration licence and the nature and extent of work that was required to be done under the work programme. 31 The onus of establishing that there was a material adverse change of circumstances is on the respondents ( ANZ Banking Group Limited v Pan Foods [1991] 1 VR 29 at 44).
 I am satisfied, therefore, on the basis of Mr Gunzburg's evidence, and, because the onus would be on the respondents, that there is a prima facie case in relation to the contractual claim founded on the alleged repudiation of the Sale Agreement. 32 As to the Loan Agreement, that cause of action turns upon the construction of a clause in the Loan Agreement.
