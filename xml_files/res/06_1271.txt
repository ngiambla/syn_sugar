 Whilst the Tribunal accepted certain claims such as the appellant's involvement in the UNP, it did not find that the level of his involvement was such that it resulted in, or would in the future result in, a risk of harm.
 The Tribunal considered each claim separately and cumulatively, finding that the appellant faced no real chance of persecution. 4 The appellant submitted that harm to a UNP branch organiser and the death of a journalist shortly before the Tribunal hearing was not taken into account by the Tribunal.
 However, the Tribunal referred to country information to the effect that the 2004 elections were generally free and fair and conducted in a democratic manner, apart from areas in the north and the east and some LTTE ("Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam") motivated violence.
 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal misunderstood the meaning of persecution and "serious harm" for the purposes of the Refugees Convention and s 91R of the Act in finding that the harm that the appellants experienced in the past did not amount to serious harm.
