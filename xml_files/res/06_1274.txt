 Moreover, it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court. 6 I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration, reflecting my reasons for judgment, that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents, and does not attach to other specified documents.
 This controversy is only likely to be quelled, completely and finally, by making a declaration in the form I propose. 7 I do not regard the fact that the Commonwealth did not cross-claim for declaratory relief as an obstacle to the declaratory relief I propose to grant.
 The Court declares that in relation to the documents listed and described in the applicant's revised list of duplicate privileged documents dated 28 July 2006, legal professional privilege attaches to duplicates of: (a) the documents listed in Schedule 1 to this Order; and (b) the parts of the documents referred to in Schedule 2 to which privilege attaches under paragraph 1(b) above. 3.
 In relation to the applicant's notice of motion dated 19 June 2006: (a) the injunctions against the first respondent made by order of the Honourable Justice Kenny on 20 June 2006 and extended by the orders of the Honourable Justice Young made on 18 July 2006 are dissolved; and (b) there be no order as to the costs of the notice of motion. 4.
