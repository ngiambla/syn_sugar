 Moreover, it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court. 6 I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration, reflecting my reasons for judgment, that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents, and does not attach to other specified documents.
 The Court declares that in relation to the documents listed and described in the applicant's revised list of duplicate privileged documents dated 28 July 2006, legal professional privilege attaches to duplicates of: (a) the documents listed in Schedule 1 to this Order; and (b) the parts of the documents referred to in Schedule 2 to which privilege attaches under paragraph 1(b) above. 3.
