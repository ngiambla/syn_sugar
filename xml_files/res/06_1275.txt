 The circumstances placed before the Tribunal were somewhat complex, emerging as they did from a confusing picture presented by the appellant's application for review to the Tribunal, and subsequently in the course of his appeals to the Federal Magistrates Court and thereafter to this Court. 2 At the time of his arrival in Australia on 30 August 2004 on a temporary business visa issued to him in Moscow, the appellant was a citizen of Armenia.
 In relation to compliance with s 424A(1) , it is unfortunate that neither the Court Book nor other evidence before the Court allows a clear finding as to what was the actual source document or documents, whether physical or electronic, from which the Tribunal gained its information as to the documents presented to the Australian Embassy and the activities of the Embassy in checking those documents.
 His Honour concluded that the letter '... sufficiently identified the potential relevance of that information, being that it was inconsistent with the factual claims of the [appellant] to the Tribunal as to his employment in Armenia and that he was in hiding' , and that as further stated in that letter in conclusion, those 'inconsistencies have the potential to cast doubt on the credibility of your claims to have had problems with the Armenian authorities for political reasons' .
 His Honour observed further that '[w] ithin the [appellant's] submissions is a contention that the Tribunal was obliged to make further inquires as to the true position concerning the [appellant's] academic qualifications and his employment' , but pointed out that '... there is clear authority that no such duty lies upon the Tribunal' , referring thereby to a number of authorities, including the Federal Court decision of Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 ; (2001) 105 FCR 212 at [15] (Whitlam, Tamberlin and Sackville JJ) and the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [43] (per Gummow and Hayne JJ).
