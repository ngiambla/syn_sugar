 Having considered some factors which weighed against the making of an order for security, his Honour said: "The main contention put forward by the respondents, which I regard as their strongest ground for the ordering of security, is that the shareholders of the applicant are the real beneficiaries of any litigation and of the applicant's business.
 Further, the respondents contend that I ought to assume that for that reason those shareholders are likely to have a significant role in funding the litigation, and if they are able to fund the litigation, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, they will be able to meet any order for security for costs.
 I raised my concerns on this issue with counsel for the applicant in the course of argument and he quite properly conceded that there was no evidence upon which I could act which would lead to the conclusion that an order for security for costs would not be met or to the conclusion that such an order would necessarily stifle the litigation.
