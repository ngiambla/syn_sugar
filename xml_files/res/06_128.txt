 COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS 1 Following upon my delivery of reasons for judgment in this matter on 22 December 2005 ( SAGA Holidays Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1892) , I have received submissions from the parties as to the appropriate order as to the costs of the proceedings. 2 The Commissioner's submission is that costs should follow the event.
 The basis for SAGA's submission is first, that the litigation was in the nature of a 'test case', so far as the Australian legislation is concerned and secondly, the Commissioner's concession, said to have been made immediately before the hearing, as to the correctness of SAGA's claim as to 'some 35%' thereof.
 SAGA has been able to point to material in evidence demonstrative of the circumstance that 'meals and drinks' supplied by Australian hotels formed some 35% of what was originally contended by the Commissioner to be subject to taxation. 4 In my opinion the litigation raised important and difficult fiscal issues in particular on the construction of the legislation, and I am unable to acknowledge the Commissioner's characterisation of the litigation as 'very much private litigation and not litigation in the public interest'.
