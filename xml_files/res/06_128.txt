 COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS 1 Following upon my delivery of reasons for judgment in this matter on 22 December 2005 ( SAGA Holidays Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1892) , I have received submissions from the parties as to the appropriate order as to the costs of the proceedings. 2 The Commissioner's submission is that costs should follow the event.
 The basis for SAGA's submission is first, that the litigation was in the nature of a 'test case', so far as the Australian legislation is concerned and secondly, the Commissioner's concession, said to have been made immediately before the hearing, as to the correctness of SAGA's claim as to 'some 35%' thereof.
