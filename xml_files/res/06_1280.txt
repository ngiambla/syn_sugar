 As an alternative (or supporting) argument, the applicant says that the amendments of 1 January 2005 operate prospectively only and that, in accordance with well-established presumptions, those amendments should not be regarded as giving new legal consequences to past events --- in this case, the importation of the goods in 2004.
 Thus the respondent argued that the Customs Act and the Tariff Act, taken together, provided not only that the determination of the rate appropriate in the circumstances of the present case was to be made as at the date when the goods were entered for home consumption, but also that the duty, if any, must be paid by the time of that entry. 11 The applicant relied upon the provision of the Tariff Act which imposed customs duty.
 He also held that, where by the importer's own fault those provisions were not complied with, the original liability stood and the time for payment had arrived. " Having set out this passage, Heydon JA said that, Isaacs J's conclusion that "the time for payment had arrived" could only have been reached as a result of a rejection by him of the argument advanced in Wilson that s 132 showed that duty was not payable until the goods were entered for home consumption.
