 For these reasons, I consider that the tribunal's determination that it was unfair and unreasonable for the trustee not to have resorted to r 4.7 to make a payment to the complainant equivalent to that which he would have received under the policy was erroneous.
 Mr Bingham submitted that the insurer was obliged to consider all facts and circumstances as at that date when it came to address the question whether the complainant was unlikely ever again to engage in remunerative work for which he was reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.
 When the latter is taken into account, it will be seen that, in this passage, the tribunal was concerned to mark out a single point of distinction between the definition in the policy, and the corresponding definition in the rules of the fund.
