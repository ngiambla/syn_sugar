 It also accepted that the appellants' house was invaded; that they were robbed; that stones were thrown at the house; and the house was set on fire. 12 However, the Tribunal found that the harassment and the invasion, and consequent fire, were as a result of the events relating to the 1987 coup in Fiji.
 It found that the appellant husband's family wanted the appellant husband to divorce his wife and found that, if they were to return to Fiji, the appellant husband's family would cause the appellants harm. 15 The Tribunal found, however: 'Looking at the evidence as whole (sic), the Tribunal is satisfied that whilst the applicants' fear of harm at the hands of the family might be Convention-related, it is nevertheless private in nature.
