 I propose to consider them together. 3 As the State of Queensland is the first respondent in the substantive action QUD 279/2004 and the only respondent in substantive action QUD 389/2005, it is convenient for the purposes of the notices of motion before me to refer to the State of Queensland as 'the respondent' although it is obviously the applicant in the present proceedings.
 In turn, it is convenient to refer to the applicants in the substantive actions QUD 279/2004 and QUD 389/2005 as 'the applicants' for the purposes of this judgment. 4 The Christian Brethren of Australia Inc was not represented before me at the hearing of the notice of motion to which it is a respondent (QUD 279/2004).
 A delegate of the President of HREOC terminated the complaint pursuant to s 46PH(2) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) ('the HREOC Act'). 11 In the substantive matters the applicants have applied under s 46PO HREOC Act for orders including a declaration that the respondent discriminated against each of the applicants pursuant to s 9 and s 15 Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Act'); an apology, $500 000 in damages, interest and costs.
 I shall deal with this issue later in the judgment. 59 The applicants submitted that the evidence already filed and served in this Court, as well as the oral evidence of Mrs Sutton given in a previous hearing, disclosed a very close financial relationship between the respondent and the Christian Brethren, and that the relationship between the respondent and the Christian Brethren was very similar to that between the respondent and other churches managing Aboriginal reserves.
 The importance of that evidence is enhanced by the fact that a number of key witnesses involved in the management of Doomadgee mission, and liaison between the Doomadgee Mission and the respondent during the relevant period have died (for example, Mrs Hockey and Mr Bedford), or are elderly, frail and unable to give evidence (for example, Mr Killoran). 68 It is clear however that Mr Hockey himself is now elderly, and in frail health. 69 At the hearing on 14 July 2006 the ability of Mr Allan Hockey to give evidence at a hearing of the substantive matter was in dispute.
 In doing so, I note that to date little evidence has been filed by the applicants themselves, other than information as to when they were working and allegations that they did not receive proper wages for that work. 111 The structure of the claims in QUD 279/2004 and QUD 389/2005 is such that, except to the extent that there is evidence relevant to a specific applicant's circumstances (for example, specific dates of employment and specific positions held), the evidence presented in QUD 389/2005 is, I understand, the same as that which would be before the Court if QUD 279/2004 proceeds. 112 The claims of the applicants are framed in terms of s 9 and s 15 of the Act.
 The respondent has also stated that it ceased paying grants to the Christian Brethren in relation to the conduct of the Doomadgee Mission in August 1983 (Defence par 7(f)). 151 In light of the submissions and the evidence which could be available at trial, it would not be appropriate to permanently stay such of the applicants' claims as relate to discrimination by the respondent against the applicants in their 'direct' employment with the respondent between 1975 and 1986.
