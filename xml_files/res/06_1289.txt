 The Authority recommended that the applicant's application not be approved because the distance between the applicant's proposed premises and the nearest other pharmacy, measured in accordance with the relevant rules determined by the Minister under s 99L , was not sufficient to meet the statutory requirement.
 According to the respondent the reference to the method of measurement is part of the definition of 'nearest other premises' in each subrule and thus to apply rule 6(b) one finds both the premises that are nearest to the proposed premises by straight line measurement as well as the premises that are nearest by the lawful access measurement. 16 This exercise might identify only one other pharmacy (say premises A) as the 'nearest' by both criteria in which case a positive recommendation can only be made if the distance from A to the proposed premises is at least 1.5 km by straight line measurement or at least 2 km by the lawful access measurement.
 In that case a positive recommendation could only be made if the distance from the proposed premises to A was at least 1.5 km by straight line measurement or the distance from the proposed premises to B was at least 2 km by the lawful access measurement.
