 It did not apparently occur to either party to order a transcript of the proceedings before the court below in which the applicant gave evidence and was cross-examined, in particular about the adequacy of his explanation for the delay. 4 The matter, so far as it concerned the probation decision may be put aside.
 In discussion today, it appears that there might be other arguable matters upon which he could rely by way of an amendment to his process if the delay should be excused, and I proceed on that basis. 7 The applicant did not come to the court below until six months after the termination decision.
 An applicant concerned to challenge a decision which has implications for other people or for day-to-day public administration may properly be regarded as being under a heavier duty to act expeditiously than is an applicant who is aware that his case has no such implications. ' 14 The case for the respondent was that the APSC is: 'only a relatively small agency and the reinstatement of Mr Twining would impact on its administration'.
 As I observed in the course of argument, to some extent these are co-extensive with questions that might arise in the Court's discretion as to whether a remedy might be granted if, otherwise, purely legal grounds of challenge to the termination decision were made out, and the matters could be more fully debated in that context.
