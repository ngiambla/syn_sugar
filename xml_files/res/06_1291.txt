 1 An order was made by the primary judge granting leave to Permanent to join Macquarie and SVB as respondents to proceedings between Permanent as applicant and the respondents ARMA and Mr Teves ( Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 847).
 A valuation by an (unnamed) valuer who is not Mr Smith would be covered by the policy. 9 The insurers submit that such a construction is untenable, commercially and as a matter of construction. 10 The primary judge noted Permanent's contention that a conjunctive interpretation was ' sufficiently arguable ' for the purposes of the operation of s 6 of the Act ( Permanent (No 1) at [41]).
 The first letter, which would seem to have been sent on Permanent's behalf by Bluestone Mortgages, included a request that Mr Teves ' notify your professional indemnity insurer that circumstances have arisen that may give rise to a claim against you and/or your firm in this matter '.
 Section 6 of the Act refers to a grant of leave to join ' the insurer ' which, it is submitted, cannot be both Macquarie and SVB. 31 His Honour held that the terms of the policies disclosed that Macquarie acted on behalf of the unidentified ' certain Underwriters at Lloyds ' and that Macquarie should be joined to the proceedings ( Permanent (No 1) at [18]).
