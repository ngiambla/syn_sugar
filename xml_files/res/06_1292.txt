 Nothing which the appellant has said to me this morning persuades me that there was any error in the Federal Magistrate's factual conclusions or in his application of the relevant law to the facts as so found in relation to the alleged nullity of the bankruptcy notice. 3 The second issue agitated before the Federal Magistrate related to a submission by the then respondent, the now appellant, that the judgment upon which the debt which gave rise to the bankruptcy notice was founded was affected by fraud and collusion.
 There is no sufficient reason in this instance not to exercise a discretion to treat the judgment as satisfactory proof of the debt. " At par 45 his Honour continued: "The mere assertion by the debtor in this instance, having regard to the failure of the debtor in earlier proceedings to set aside the order and/or the registered judgment lead me to conclude that it would be inappropriate for this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, to go behind the judgment. " 6 In my view the approach which the Federal Magistrate took to this question was wholly appropriate and is quite free from any error.
