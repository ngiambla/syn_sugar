 The affidavit of the process server combined with his evidence tested in cross-examination, though at times appearing to be unsatisfactory from the extract referred to earlier in this judgment, nevertheless persuades me, on the balance of probabilities, that the complete bankruptcy notice was served upon the debtor as claimed. " At par 33 of his reasons his Honour said: "I accept the applicant's evidence in relation to service of the complete bankruptcy notice in the circumstances particularly where, in support of his application to set aside the bankruptcy notice in earlier proceedings, the debtor failed to refer to the alleged incomplete bankruptcy notice at a time when, at the very least, he was receiving assistance from a solicitor. " In the light of these and other findings, the Federal Magistrate concluded that the bankruptcy notice was properly served and was complete and should not be regarded as a nullity.
 Nothing which the appellant has said to me this morning persuades me that there was any error in the Federal Magistrate's factual conclusions or in his application of the relevant law to the facts as so found in relation to the alleged nullity of the bankruptcy notice. 3 The second issue agitated before the Federal Magistrate related to a submission by the then respondent, the now appellant, that the judgment upon which the debt which gave rise to the bankruptcy notice was founded was affected by fraud and collusion.
 There is no sufficient reason in this instance not to exercise a discretion to treat the judgment as satisfactory proof of the debt. " At par 45 his Honour continued: "The mere assertion by the debtor in this instance, having regard to the failure of the debtor in earlier proceedings to set aside the order and/or the registered judgment lead me to conclude that it would be inappropriate for this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, to go behind the judgment. " 6 In my view the approach which the Federal Magistrate took to this question was wholly appropriate and is quite free from any error.
