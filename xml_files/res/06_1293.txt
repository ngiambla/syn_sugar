 Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strike-out of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts, issues and contentions (the proposed order 2) and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment (the proposed order 3). 3 As to the order 2 (relating to the principal outcome to the proceedings), the competing texts proposed by the parties in proceeding NSD 539 of 2004 (by way of illustration) are as follows: Order 2 --- proposed by the Commissioner: '2.
 IEF drew attention to the manner in which and the time at which a taxpayer, dissatisfied with an assessment of tax or with the scope otherwise of a reviewable objection decision of the Commissioner, may appropriately object, being matters regulated by ss 14ZU and 14ZW of the Administration Act, and the requirement of s 14ZY that the Commissioner determine whether to allow an objection, in whole or in part, or to disallow it. 7 IEF then submitted that where a notice incorporates reference to two or more decisions or determinations, those decisions 'are taken to be one taxation decision' by virtue of s 14ZR(1) of the Administration Act.
