 Correct identification of a claim is essential to enable the Tribunal effectively to exercise the jurisdiction which the Parliament has confided it to exercise under s 414(1) of the Act: see Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at 394-395 [26] - [27] per Gummow and Callinan JJ. 15 What the Tribunal did was to set out in a section headed, 'Claims and Evidence', the fact that it had before it the Department's file.
 However, that process was somewhat limited by a proper construction of the legislation (see 150 FCR 259-260 [206]-[207]). 37 The way in which the Tribunal expressed its reasons, subject to one qualification to which I will come, appears to me to display an evaluative process of the claims and the lack of material put before the Tribunal in support of those claims.
 I do not think that it could be inferred or implied that the requirements of procedural fairness necessitated the Tribunal, in arriving at a decision under s 426A(1) to consider contacting the appellant, and, if it failed to do so, the whole of the exercise of its jurisdiction would be thrown into doubt.
