 Readymix drew attention to the affidavit of Readymix's solicitor of 23 August 2006, which recounted the steps undertaken by Readymix, commencing from January 2006, to obtain Mr Better's report on behalf of Readymix, relating of course to what was then mutually understood to have been authentic drawings of the SLP 1100 crusher, and to provide that report to Wieland.
 Readymix drew attention moreover to the requests made by Readymix to Wieland, commencing immediately upon the termination of the mediation on 3 August 2006, for confirmation or otherwise as to the status of the 'as-built set of design manufacturing drawings as represented to [Readymix] on 31 January and 1 February 2006', which confirmation was not forthcoming in the events which happened until very recently.
 Reference was also made by Readymix to its follow-up email of 9 August 2006 to Wieland for information inter alia as to the documentary evidence upon which Wieland would rely at the hearing, to which there was said to have been no response, and to Readymix's subsequent email of 11 August 2006 concerning inter alia the 'as-built' drawings, to which there was said to have also been no response.
 The costs of Readymix thrown away would appear to be in principle those relating to professional work undertaken and disbursements incurred as a result of steps implemented by Readymix's legal representatives to arrange inspection of the SLP 1100 crusher then located in Melbourne and to obtain expert reports in relation thereto, including in principle costs relating to Mr Better's fees and disbursements to the extent to which the same can rightly be described as thrown away, as well as costs associated with the vacation of the hearing.
