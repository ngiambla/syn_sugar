 Readymix drew attention to the affidavit of Readymix's solicitor of 23 August 2006, which recounted the steps undertaken by Readymix, commencing from January 2006, to obtain Mr Better's report on behalf of Readymix, relating of course to what was then mutually understood to have been authentic drawings of the SLP 1100 crusher, and to provide that report to Wieland.
 Reference was also made by Readymix to its follow-up email of 9 August 2006 to Wieland for information inter alia as to the documentary evidence upon which Wieland would rely at the hearing, to which there was said to have been no response, and to Readymix's subsequent email of 11 August 2006 concerning inter alia the 'as-built' drawings, to which there was said to have also been no response.
