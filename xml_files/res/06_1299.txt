 That provides in relation to an extension 'that where a party applies for an extension of time he shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, pay the costs of and occasioned by the application or any order made on or in consequence of the application'. 4 The respondent does not oppose the granting of the motion in the event that the Court is satisfied that it has power to extend the time.
 Subrule (2) provides that the time may be extended under the Rule, or any other Rule allowing for an extension of time (unless the Rule provides otherwise) before or after the time expires and whether or not an application for extension is made before the time expires.
 The effect of the extension is to remove the foundation for the deeming provision until the extended of time has expired. 7 I do not agree with the respondent that FCR O 62 r 46 must be read independently of the other provisions in FCR O 62, including O 62 r 23, or of the Rules not specifically excluded. 8 However, I agree with the respondent that FCR O 62 r 23 is supportive of its submission that the respondent should have an order for his costs on the motion in any event.
