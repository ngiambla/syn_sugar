 CSL further claims that those general practitioners who received the GSKA Information Sheet would understand it to be saying that CERVARIX was a superior vaccine to GARDASIL because it offered greater benefits. 24 The evidence is that the GSKA Information Sheet was distributed to at least 300 general practitioners.
 It refers to the GARDASIL Product Information Sheet, which contained TGA approval of the statement that GARDASIL was indicated in females aged 9 to 26 years for the prevention of vulvar and vaginal cancer caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.
 He said that the GSKA Information Sheet, and the representations contained therein would have no impact or affect on CSL's application for such funding. 74 Mr Herd said that GSKA would itself suffer irreparable harm if interlocutory relief were granted to CSL.
