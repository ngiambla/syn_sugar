 The application also sought visas for members of his family. 3 The appellant told the Tribunal that he feared persecution from persons associated with the Bangladeshi Nationalist Party ('BNP') which was the largest party in a coalition government which came to power on 1 October 2001.
 Immediately thereafter the Tribunal said that it had assigned 'little evidential value' to certain documentary evidence which had been tendered by the appellant in support of his application to the Tribunal.
 The related contention was that procedural fairness required the Tribunal to alert the appellant to its concerns relating to the authenticity of the documents so as to provide him with the opportunity to make submissions on the point. 7 In my view both grounds must fail.
 No attempt was made in the affidavit to provide detail of the extent of the appellant's 'direct' participation in the affairs of the Awami League or as to the period over which such service was rendered.
