 At this time, the plaintiffs were working under the assumption of the general accuracy of the carrier's surveyor's report which had been given to them on a without prejudice basis by the carrier and which they supplied on a similar basis to Newcastle Stevedores. 5 This document had, as it turns out, an important typographical error in it, that is, of the date of discharge.
 The reason that this becomes important is that during the course of this year when this error and its significance became apparent to solicitors on both sides there had been produced from the relevant authorities records which indicated that there was no rainfall in Newcastle in the relevant 24-hour period by reference to the surveyor boarding on the 25 th , whereas there had been some rainfall, albeit minor, in the following 24-hour period. 6 This inaccuracy could have been attended to earlier by the fifth defendant.
 Mr Hunt on behalf of the fifth defendant says that his client has now discharged practically the relevant onus upon him and given that he would have won the case on this hypothesis and obtained his costs, perhaps at the expense of one of the other defendants, there should be no real difference at this point. 8 It is unfortunate that an oversight of this kind would have led to six months' costs for one party.
