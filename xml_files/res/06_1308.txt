 Mr Haddad is also associated with at least eight other companies (referred to in Mr Hallman's affidavit of 29 June 2005, par 11). 10 Mr Hallman's affidavit established that Liban Net had sold car insurance to about nine groups of people who are described as Bartercard members, 11 groups of people who were described as Barter Board Xchange members, and to other members of the public.
 McHugh J described the range of 7 to 12 years as being reserved for cases which were serious, though not the worst cases. 62 Factors that go to the imposition of the penalty in that range include the serious incompetence and irresponsibility of the defendant and substantial loss.
 He did not inform anyone of his own clear knowledge of the financial difficulties which the business had, the fact that people were not being paid and he took no responsibility to communicate with those whose fortunes were immediately affected by, inter alia, that dishonour.
 In my opinion, Mr Haddad had a complete disregard for the legal responsibility which he had as a director of Liban Net or as a person who was a manager in its business. 66 I am also mindful of his lack of contrition, although I do have regard to his acceptance of responsibility in joining in the application to have the Court make the orders by consent.
