 Master Wheeler granted judgment in favour of the respondent as a result of the appellant's non-compliance with Master Kings' order, and ordered that the appellant pay damages to the respondent fixed at $226,492, plus costs ("the 5 November judgment"). 11 On 8 November 2004, the appellant entered a plea of guilty in the County Court of Victoria to a charge of theft of money from the respondent between 15 August 2002 and 19 October 2002.
 Master Evans set aside the 5 November judgment, apparently on the basis that he considered that the 7 October orders were irregular in form, with the consequence that the 5 November judgment was also irregular. 16 The respondent appealed against the orders of Master Evans.
 In a judgment delivered on 27 July 2005, his Honour allowed the respondent's appeal and refused the appellant's application to set aside the 5 November judgment: see Todaytech No 2 . 17 Hargrave J rejected the contention that the 7 October orders and the 5 November judgment were in some way irregular.
