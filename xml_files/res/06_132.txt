 These reasons for judgment are to be read together with the reasons for judgment in Bell , delivered this day. 2 Ms Mackay also claimed that her employer breached cl 26 of the Health and Disability Services --- Support Workers - Western Australian Government - Award 2001 in respect of her.
 Any other construction of cl 26.7 of the award would be unworkable impose an unnecessary administrative burden on an employer. 5 For the above reasons and the reasons set out in Bell as to the proper construction of cl 26 of the award, the application is dismissed.
