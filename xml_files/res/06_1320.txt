 1 I have before me a Notice of Motion by which the Respondents seek an order for further discovery on the part of both Applicants, an order that both Applicants provide further answers to interrogatories in order to comply with the order made on 6 July 2006 and an order that the Applicants in the proceeding pay the costs of the Motion. 2 Considerable correspondence has passed between the solicitors for the parties in relation to discovery and aspects of the answers to interrogatories with the result that no order is now sought for further discovery.
 On 13 February 2001, Margaret Hearn (and Taccara Hearn) signed a document described as a 'Formal Letter of Authorisation' (Annexure B to the affidavit of Brian Hatch affirmed and filed on 9 August 2006) which, in part, provides: 'I, Margaret Hearn, do hereby engage the services of Stephen Hagan of Toowoomba to represent my daughter Cara and myself on all matters relating to taking defamation and or any other legal action against the producer and distributor of the film "Cunnamulla".
 Further to my answer to interrogatory no 38 in my answer to interrogatories dated 3 April 2006, I say that: (a) Mr Hagan was not and has never been a lawyer; (b) It was not my intention through the letter of authority or otherwise to allow Mr Hagan to commence or represent me in any legal action; (c) The effect of the authorisation letter, as I understood it, was that Mr Hagan was going to assist my mother and I to secure the services of a lawyer and then was going to liaise with us and the lawyer to assist in the provision of instructions; (d) To the extent that Mr Hagan was retained for the abovementioned purposes, in practice he has done little more than secure the services of Drakopoulos Black Solicitors for us and all communications between us and Drakopoulos Black regarding the court proceedings have been direct and have not involved Mr Hagan at all. 2.
 I accept that the application has been made necessary by the failure on the part of the Applicants to provide further answers to interrogatories consistent with the commitment the Applicants made at the directions hearing. 40 However, because the Respondents abandoned that part of the Motion dealing with discovery and were unsuccessful in respect of the challenge to the answers by the First Applicant to interrogatories 38-41, I propose to order that the Applicants in the proceeding pay 40 per cent of the costs of and incidental to the Notice of Motion filed on 9 August 2006 by the Respondents in the proceeding.
