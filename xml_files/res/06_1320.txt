 1 I have before me a Notice of Motion by which the Respondents seek an order for further discovery on the part of both Applicants, an order that both Applicants provide further answers to interrogatories in order to comply with the order made on 6 July 2006 and an order that the Applicants in the proceeding pay the costs of the Motion. 2 Considerable correspondence has passed between the solicitors for the parties in relation to discovery and aspects of the answers to interrogatories with the result that no order is now sought for further discovery.
 I accept that the application has been made necessary by the failure on the part of the Applicants to provide further answers to interrogatories consistent with the commitment the Applicants made at the directions hearing. 40 However, because the Respondents abandoned that part of the Motion dealing with discovery and were unsuccessful in respect of the challenge to the answers by the First Applicant to interrogatories 38-41, I propose to order that the Applicants in the proceeding pay 40 per cent of the costs of and incidental to the Notice of Motion filed on 9 August 2006 by the Respondents in the proceeding.
