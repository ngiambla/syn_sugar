 The Court's discretion under s 56 of the Act is broad and unfettered and, whilst it must be exercised judicially, the Court's consideration is not limited to the matters mentioned in O 28 r 3 of the Rules.
 The Court may order security for costs in the exercise of its discretion, after considering all the circumstances of the case. 23 The question is whether the Court should, in the exercise of this discretion, award security for costs in the second and third respondents' favour.
 Having regard to the evidence filed in support of, and in opposition to, the motion, application for security turns principally on the questions, whether or not the applicant is ordinarily resident outside Australia and has no assets within the jurisdiction.
