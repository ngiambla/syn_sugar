 His case is that, on the limited evidence before the court, I should not be satisfied that a debt of not less than $2,000 was owing by Mr Meinhardt, or is now owing by his estate; or at least, that I should not be satisfied that any such debt was due and payable immediately or at a certain time.
 Mr Smith said that he had various telephone calls with Mr McKenzie, and that the latter said that he would do what he could, but the agreement was never signed. 22 The sum of $HK9,451,700.00 was transferred from the applicant to Mr Meinhardt on 31 January 2001.
 Mr Smith, on behalf of the applicant, wrote to the executor of Mr Meinhardt's estate, referring to what was said to be a loan made to Mr Meinhardt in the sum of $HK9,451,700.00 on 30 January 2001 'with a repayment date of 2004 or earlier'.
 Although the matter was not argued before me in this context, the essence of Mr Bigmore's submission is that there was a contract between Mr Meinhardt and the applicant which contained an implied term to the effect that repayment would be effected only by the crediting of profit share bonus allocations from time to time.
