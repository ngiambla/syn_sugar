 Note : This subsection is affected by section 120A. ' 12 Section 120A, which affects the operation of both s 120(1) and (3), requires the reasonableness of a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death of a veteran with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person for the purposes of s 120(3) to be assessed by reference to appropriate Statements of Principles ('SoPs').
 DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 16 As I noted earlier in this judgment, the Tribunal was satisfied that the period of defence service relevant to the claim of the applicant, namely from 4 June 1969 until 15 May 1970, was operational service and eligible war service as those terms are defined in s 7 and s 6C of the Act.
 The Tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what actually occurred on 9 November 1969 was not consistent with the version relied upon by Dr Mulholland. (b) In any event, the Tribunal stated that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident at Nui Dat was not an event that met the requirements of 'experiencing a severe stressor' as provided for in the SoP concerning Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Accordingly, the condition was not 'war-caused' under s 9. (c) The analysis in relation to post traumatic stress disorder was equally applicable in relation to the applicant's claim concerning dysthymic disorder, namely as to whether the minefield incident was a severe psycho-social stressor.
 The Tribunal made a finding not open on Dr Barry's evidence 51 Although this was not raised as a question of law in the notice of appeal, Ms Carter Nicoll submitted during the hearing before me that the findings of Dr Barry were misrepresented in the Tribunal's decision, that the Tribunal therefore misdirected itself on the evidence, and that the Tribunal made a finding not open on the evidence.
