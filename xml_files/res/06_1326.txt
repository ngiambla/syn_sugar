 Note : This subsection is affected by section 120A. ' 12 Section 120A, which affects the operation of both s 120(1) and (3), requires the reasonableness of a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death of a veteran with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person for the purposes of s 120(3) to be assessed by reference to appropriate Statements of Principles ('SoPs').
 In particular, s 120A(3) provides: 'For the purposes of subsection 120(3), a hypothesis connecting an injury suffered by a person, a disease contracted by a person or the death of a person with the circumstances of any particular service rendered by the person is reasonable only if there is in force: (a) a Statement of Principles determined under subsection 196B(2) or (11); or (b) a determination of the Commission under subsection 180A(2); that upholds the hypothesis. 13 A hypothesis in this context cannot be reasonable if it is contrary to known scientific facts or is obviously fanciful or untenable: Byrnes v Repatriation Commission [1993] HCA 51 ; (1993) 177 CLR 564 at 571.
 Further, in Bushell v Repatriation Commission [1992] HCA 47 ; (1992) 175 CLR 408 at 416 the High Court said: 'The Commission will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt "that there is no sufficient ground for making [the] determination" if it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it cannot accept the raised facts or so many of them as are necessary to support the hypothesis.
