 In any event, it is apparent that the claim of bias is based merely upon the terms of the decision which, as counsel for the respondents submits, is extremely difficult to establish ( SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668). 4 Although the third ground was not spelled out in advance of the hearing as it should have been, the appellant referred to s 424A of the Act, linking it in a general way with a finding by the Tribunal.
 Documents from this province are therefore always regarded suspiciously (DFAT, 21/10/92 CX643). ' 7 Counsel for the respondent Minister accepts that the information in relation to forgery was part of the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review and therefore accepts that, prima facie, s 424A(1) of the Act was engaged.
 I accept the submission by counsel for the respondent Minister that the proper construction of that subsection has been settled by a series of Full Court decisions such that the information in question here is within that subsection and so not caught by the section ( VHAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 82 , (2004) 80 ALD 559; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572; WAJW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 330 ; QAAC of 2004 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCAFC 92 ; and VJAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 178). 8 The appeal is dismissed.
