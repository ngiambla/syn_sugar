 1 This is one of three cases, heard together, which raised the same question for determination --- whether certain funds form assets of a company in liquidation for distribution in the liquidation of that company, or whether those funds constitute an asset held pursuant to a terminated deed of company arrangement for the benefit of deed creditors.
 Otherwise, the resolution was passed unanimously. 13 A schedule of the hourly rates of the Deed Administrators and their staff was circulated under cover of the notice convening the first meeting of creditors. 14 It is claimed that the time costs incurred by the Deed Administrators in the course of the deed administration totalled the sum of $38 632.
 The details of that calculation are in evidence. 15 A resolution concerning approval of the Deed Administrators' additional remuneration was not put to the creditors at the meeting convened pursuant to s 445F of the Act, which led to the winding up. 16 The plaintiffs seek the following relief in this respect: 'An order pursuant to sections 447A and/or 449E(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that the remuneration of the Deed Administrators be reviewed and increased in the sum of $20,000 (inclusive of GST) ( Deed Administrators' Remuneration ).
