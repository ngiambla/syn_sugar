 Section 568(1) is in the following terms (so far as is relevant): '(1) Subject to this section, a liquidator of a company may at any time, on the company's behalf, by signed writing disclaim property of the company that consists of: (a) land burdened with onerous covenants; or ... (c) property that is unsaleable or is not readily saleable; or (d) property that may give rise to a liability to pay money or some other onerous obligation; or (e) property where it is reasonable to expect that the costs, charges and expenses that would be incurred in realising the property would exceed the proceeds of realising the property; ...' 7 The result of the funding agreement and the purposes agreement was that there were significant positive and negative obligations imposed upon the company in relation to the use and disposition of the property.
 The evidence is that that office does not hold the certificates of title and that enquiries of the relevant officer of the liquidator indicate that the certificates of title were not amongst the records of the company. 12 In view of the evidence concerning the loss or destruction of the certificates of title, it is appropriate that an order be made pursuant to s 138 of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) to cancel those certificates and issue new certificates reflecting the vesting.
