 The applicant submits that even if, contrary to its primary submission, a direction preventing Ms Boots from acting or appearing at the examination was within power and was properly made, the direction in the written reasons was beyond power.
 I will need to return to this issue. 20 The applicant seeks a declaration that the direction made by the respondent on 30 January 2006 is invalid and of no effect and an injunction restraining the respondent, his servants and agents from giving effect to or taking any step under the direction.
 In my opinion, he has the power to exclude a particular legal practitioner from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination. 54 The direction is within power insofar as it prevents Ms Boots from appearing or acting for the applicant at the examination.
 However, the direction actually made by the respondent went further than this, and, to the extent that it did, it is beyond power. 60 In view of those conclusions I will hear the parties as to the appropriate orders and on the question of costs.
