 Thirdly, I thought it appropriate to allow the second and third applicants to consider my reasons in case they wished to make any application to amend their pleadings. 4 The second and third applicants applied to amend their statement of claim to accord with my reasons for judgment and to claim the sums to which I indicated the second and third applicants would be entitled if their pleadings were amended. 5 The application was very late being made after trial and after the Court's reasons had been exposed.
 They neither consented to nor opposed the application. 11 The respondents had been on notice since November 2005 that expert evidence would be led to support a claim for loss and damage in accordance with the proposed amendment. 12 It appears, however, that the applicants did not at that same time address the need to seek to amend the statement of claim or, if they did, thought it unnecessary. 13 At the trial, evidence to which no objection was made was led from Mr Gilmour to establish loss or damage in accordance with the proposed amendment.
 No evidence was led from the respondents in answer to the expert evidence of the applicant. 14 Because the respondents were always on notice of the applicants' claim for loss and damage in the manner contemplated in the proposed amendment, and because the trial proceeded upon the basis that was the applicants' case, in my opinion, justice demanded that I allow the proposed amendment. 15 For those reasons, I allowed the second and third applicants to amend in accordance with the proposed amended statement of claim exhibited to the affidavit of the third applicant sworn on 25 September 2006.
