 His Honour rejected all of these grounds. 3 The substance of the argument that was put before me this morning on behalf of the respondent was that these various interlocutory processes constituted evidence of a collateral purpose being pursued by Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ('APRA'), which rendered the proceeding an abuse of process.
 That conduct, in the main, involved the seeking of interim and interlocutory orders from the Court, which applications were granted. 4 When the efficacy of those orders were challenged before Merkel J in March of this year, as has already been noted, his Honour rejected those claims.
