 IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA VICTORIA DISTRICT REGISTRY VID 1607 OF 2005 BETWEEN: AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY Applicant AND: DAVID ROBERT SIMINTON (NO 4) Respondent JUDGE : TRACEY J DATE: 6 OCTOBER 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE RULING 1 By notice of motion, dated 27 September 2006, the respondent seeks orders in substance striking out the proceeding that is presently before the Court, on the ground that it constitutes an abuse of process.
 His Honour rejected all of these grounds. 3 The substance of the argument that was put before me this morning on behalf of the respondent was that these various interlocutory processes constituted evidence of a collateral purpose being pursued by Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ('APRA'), which rendered the proceeding an abuse of process.
 That conduct, in the main, involved the seeking of interim and interlocutory orders from the Court, which applications were granted. 4 When the efficacy of those orders were challenged before Merkel J in March of this year, as has already been noted, his Honour rejected those claims.
 However, I am told that notices under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) have been served on the various Attorneys-General and that they have, in each case, indicated that those who have thus far responded have, do not wish to intervene in the proceeding, at least at this stage. 6 I say nothing as to the merits of the constitutional argument.
