 This position involves Ms Bell working shifts as a patient care assistant, relieving persons who occupy that substantive classification and who are not available for duty at particular times. 3 When engaged as a cleaner Ms Bell worked an average of 70 hours per fortnight.
 Together with cl 26.8, which deals with 'posting' of rosters 48 hours before they come into operation, cl 26.7 requires the publication of a roster for a full time employee showing start and end times for shifts and rostered days off.
 It could only be rudimentary given the day to day management issues which cause relief staff to be deployed. 17 In any event, from December 2003 Ms Bell has worked a regular pattern of hours.
 This is a desirable practice, especially when it is known that relief staff will be needed to replace workers on long service leave, annual leave and maternity leave. 18 No breach of cl 26 has been established in respect of the period 16 June 2003 to December 2003 because the award did not intend that a roster be formally set for relief staff whose working hours may vary on short notice to meet practical exigencies.
