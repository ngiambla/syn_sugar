 The Tribunal considered that the period during which the appellant had been resident in Australia was not sufficient to qualify him for citizenship when considered against the mandatory requirements of s 13(1)(d) and of s 13(1)(e) of the Act. 10 The appellant was not present in Australia when he lodged his citizenship application.
 The appellant also refers to the decision of the Tribunal in Re Sadawut Taechaubol v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] AATA 425. 19 Accordingly, the appellant submits that the Tribunal's discretion should not have been confined by the Policy and that the Court should determine the boundaries of the discretion provided by s 13(4) of the Act.
 For this reason, the second ground of appeal is rejected. 31 Before proceeding to deal with the orders, the Court notes that consistent with the decision of the High Court of Australia in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at 173 [43] , the Tribunal should be joined as a party.
