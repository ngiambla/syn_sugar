 The liquidators have filed proofs of debt of $12,370,370.40 in respect of North Sydney Finance and $25,288,098.98 in respect of Emu Brewery Mezzanine. 5 The reason why I have given leave for those companies to appear today is because there is a controversy as to who should be appointed as liquidators of the company.
 Mr Greg Nairn said words to him to the effect that, he was the only director of Westpoint Management Pty Ltd, and he was going to apply to Court on 6 February 2006 for the appointment of a provisional liquidator to Westpoint Management Pty Ltd and that he wanted Mr Ryan and Mr Francis to act as provisional liquidators of Westpoint Management Pty Ltd.
 Mr Shaw, on behalf of North Sydney Finance and Emu Brewery Mezzanine, has taken me to an annexure to the affidavit of Mr Francis which indicates that the amount of money which is said to be chargeable in respect of those investigations is $153,230.00. 15 As a consequence of carrying out that work, Mr Francis has produced a draft report to creditors which he has exhibited to his affidavit.
 He submitted that a factor which should be taken into account in considering whether to appoint Mr Read and Mr Herbert, is that the affairs of Westpoint Management Pty Ltd and the company are substantially intertwined, and that the on-going investigations would be assisted if there was one set of liquidators in respect of both companies.
