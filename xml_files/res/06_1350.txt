 These concerns were discussed at the return of that motion on 3 October 2006 and at that time I raised the possibility that, because of the obvious governance difficulties affecting CRI, it might be necessary to consider the appointment of a receiver. 4 There has been debate today about how the matter should proceed.
 I will authorise him to obtain independent legal advice in order to enable him to properly discharge his functions in that regard. 7 The receiver shall be entitled to reasonable remuneration and costs, and to an indemnity out of the assets of CRI in respect of those costs.
 The freezing orders I made on 2 June and 7 July 2006 will be varied to the extent necessary to give effect to these orders and there will be liberty to apply to the Court for further directions by the receiver and by any other party.
