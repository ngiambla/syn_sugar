 These concerns were discussed at the return of that motion on 3 October 2006 and at that time I raised the possibility that, because of the obvious governance difficulties affecting CRI, it might be necessary to consider the appointment of a receiver. 4 There has been debate today about how the matter should proceed.
 I will authorise him to obtain independent legal advice in order to enable him to properly discharge his functions in that regard. 7 The receiver shall be entitled to reasonable remuneration and costs, and to an indemnity out of the assets of CRI in respect of those costs.
