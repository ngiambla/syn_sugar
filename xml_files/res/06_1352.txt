 However, old Boston was to remain fully responsible for the performance of all services provided under the GE Capital contract (cl 22(c)). 13 The statement of claim pleaded that old Boston incurred costs and expenses to prepare for complying with the service standards which were agreed between it and GE Capital on the basis that those expenses would be amortised over a two year term.
 However, the claim sought to be assigned is of a right to sue for unliquidated damages for breach of contract which new Boston claims to have acquired only because of the effect of the transaction in which it acquired old Boston's business. 81 Old Boston is not a party to the proceedings.
 In those circumstances, I consider that there is no reasonable prospect that old Boston would be able to establish, as alleged in the statement of claim, that there was a term of the GE Capital contract that some minimum number of field calls would be referred to old Boston per month.
