 1 In this matter I am satisfied from the evidence that the defendant, Joseph Sleiman, is presently unable to act as either liquidator or administrator of the companies respectively listed in the initiating process as his registration has been cancelled pursuant to s 1292(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) (s 448B ; s 532(1) of the Act).
