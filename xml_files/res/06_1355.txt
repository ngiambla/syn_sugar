 The Tribunal noted that during the hearing, the appellant had confirmed country information that the employment situation was difficult generally in Jordan, and noted that the appellant did manage to find employment both in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. 7 The Tribunal concluded that there was not a real chance of the appellant being persecuted if he returned to Jordan.
 The appellant feared that if he disclosed that he held a bridging visa pending determination of his claim to be entitled to a protection visa he might experience persecution for his presumed political affiliations if he were required to return to Jordan.
 The appellant's fear was at least partly based on his belief that one of his friends who unsuccessfully applied for an Australian protection visa had been arrested and detained when he returned to Jordan for having criticised the Jordanian government while he was in Australia.
