 The allegations are as follows. 9 Paragraph 73 : In early 2001 Visy and Amcor arrived at an understanding that Visy would not seek to enter into contracts for the supply of CFP to GFL and Nestl, two of Amcor's principal customers, and that if GFL or Nestl required Visy to provide a quote Visy would quote prices higher than the prices Amcor quoted to GFL and Nestl.
 The understanding was also said to be implied from the conduct of Visy and Amcor alleged in pars 77-87. 10 Paragraphs 74-76 allege the various ways in which the GFL Nestl Price Understanding contravened the Trade Practices Act . 11 Paragraph 77 : In March-April 2001 Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw had a discussion in which Mr Carroll said Visy was not interested in picking up the GFL account.
 Mr Pratt confirmed this. 15 Paragraph 81 : In Visy's tender proposal (par 78) and Amcor's tender proposal (par 79) (a) Visy's prices were higher than Amcor's prices and/or (b) GFL "held the belief" that Visy's prices were higher than Amcor's prices. 16 Paragraph 82 : On 8 June 2001 Amcor reached "informal agreement" with GFL for Amcor to supply CFP to GFL. 17 Paragraph 83 : On 23 November 2001 Amcor and GFL entered into a written agreement for Amcor to supply CFP. 18 Paragraph 84 : Between June 2001 and February 2002 Amcor and Nestl were involved in negotiations for a new CFP supply agreement in which Amcor sought to obtain an increase of approximately 54 per cent. 19 Paragraph 85 : Between July 2001 and February 2002 Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw discussed the Nestl account.
 As to the term of agreements, Mr Heathcote says that the term of a current arrangement between Amcor and one of its customers is information generally available to Visy either as a result of previous tenders or proposals made on behalf of Visy to those customers or often because customers provide that information to Visy to create competitive tension in a tender process.
