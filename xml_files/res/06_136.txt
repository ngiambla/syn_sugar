 The allegations are as follows. 9 Paragraph 73 : In early 2001 Visy and Amcor arrived at an understanding that Visy would not seek to enter into contracts for the supply of CFP to GFL and Nestl, two of Amcor's principal customers, and that if GFL or Nestl required Visy to provide a quote Visy would quote prices higher than the prices Amcor quoted to GFL and Nestl.
 The understanding was also said to be implied from the conduct of Visy and Amcor alleged in pars 77-87. 10 Paragraphs 74-76 allege the various ways in which the GFL Nestl Price Understanding contravened the Trade Practices Act . 11 Paragraph 77 : In March-April 2001 Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw had a discussion in which Mr Carroll said Visy was not interested in picking up the GFL account.
