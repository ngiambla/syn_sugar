 BACKGROUND 4 The summary of the facts which follows is taken from the Decision Record of the RRT and the Reasons for Judgment of the Federal Magistrate. 5 The applicant is a citizen of India.
 On 31 March 2005 he lodged an application for a protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (as it was then called) under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 No evidence was filed by the applicant. 14 The Federal Magistrate concluded that the grounds advanced in the application before him were, with the exception of four, 'either an attack on the merits of the RRT decision or bald unparticularised assertions'.
 Furthermore, I agree that the remainder of the grounds do not afford a foundation for a remedy under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 . 34 Were it necessary for me to decide the appeal I would dismiss it.
