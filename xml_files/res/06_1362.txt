 Upon consideration of the factors set out in s 32AB (6) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) and O 82 r 7 of the Federal Court Rules , I deem that it is an appropriate matter to be transferred, assuming that there is jurisdiction to do so.
 I also need to take into account the opposition of the applicant, which has been put very forcefully, if I may say so, this afternoon. 2 First of all, there would have been a good deal to be said for the applicant's submissions prior to the enactment of s 32AB of the Act which now, it seems to me, makes quite clear that there is first of all, jurisdiction to transfer the proceeding, and secondly, if it is transferred, then the Federal Magistrates Court has the same jurisdiction as does this Court to resolve the matter. 3 It seems to me that an application of this kind under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), and any pendant jurisdiction which will be involved in it, is appropriate to be heard by the Federal Magistrates Court.
 Even though I must pay regard to the opposition of the applicant, in one sense the applicant may be gaining another level of appeal to this Court. 4 Taking all those things into account, I propose to transfer the proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court.
