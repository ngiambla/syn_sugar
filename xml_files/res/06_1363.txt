 A single judge may hear and determine an application to stay an order of the Full Court (s 25(2)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)). 3 New Zealand, by its counsel, has confirmed that, in accordance with the requirements of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), the respondents will not be removed to New Zealand before any timely application which they may make for special leave to appeal to the High Court is heard and determined.
 It would not be appropriate to order a stay simply to preserve the status quo ( Edelsten v Ward (No 2) (1988) 63 ALJR 346). 4 The test of whether the circumstances relied upon are sufficient to justify a departure from the ordinary rule must, I consider, be no less strict than the statutory test for the grant of an order for release on bail under s 35(6)(g)(iv) of the Extradition Act ; that is, there must be special circumstances justifying such a course. 5 In considering whether the above test is satisfied in this case it is appropriate to note that special leave to appeal to the High Court is not readily granted.
 Thirdly, that they are both in poor health, including poor psychological health and may face more than usual problems should they be incarcerated. 7 As I observed in the case of Heslehurst v Government of New Zealand [2000] FCA 937 at [16] , in the context of an application for bail under s 35(6)(g)(iv) of the Extradition Act : 'The Court does not treat lightly the deprivation of liberty of any person before it, particularly where that person is unwell.
 The present application is not brought under s 35(6) of the Extradition Act but Australia's obligations to New Zealand are the same as the obligations to New Zealand to which I referred in Heslehurst . 9 Having given anxious consideration to the material upon which the respondents rely in support of their stay application, I am not satisfied that the material demonstrates the exceptional circumstances necessary to warrant the grant of the stay which they seek.
