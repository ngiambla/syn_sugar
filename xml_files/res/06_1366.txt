 Mr Laba-Sarkis reiterated in his submissions that he had good reason to believe, and still believed, that the Minister's conduct relating to the letter dated 23 March 2006 could be reviewed by a court in the applicant's favour.
 In the alternative, the Minister sought an order that costs be paid by the applicant. 17 The Minister's primary submission was that Mr Laba-Sarkis had encouraged the applicant in the relevant sense and had not given proper consideration to the prospects of success of the application.
 In my opinion, the only inference that can be drawn is that Mr Laba-Sarkis did not give proper consideration of the prospects of success of the application for leave. 26 The next issue is whether I should exercise the discretionary power conferred by s 486F to order Mr Laba-Sarkis to pay the Minister's costs.
