 On that basis, I was satisfied that confirmation of the Lifetime Scheme will not affect the likelihood of the practice of granting policy loans being reinstated. 28 Mr Bray also submitted to the Court that he held general concerns regarding the standards of communication between Lifetime and MLC and policy holders.
 In particular, Mr Bray noted that neither Lifetime nor MLC had disclosed to Lifetime policy holders that the effect of the Lifetime Scheme was to reverse an earlier scheme, confirmed by the Court in 1997, whereby MLC transferred part of its life insurance business to Lifetime.
