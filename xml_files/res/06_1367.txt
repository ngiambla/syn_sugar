 Procedural Steps 6 Section 191 of the Act and Pt 9 of the Life Insurance Regulations 1995 (Cth) ('the Regulations') provide that an application for confirmation of a scheme may not be made unless certain steps have been taken.
 I was satisfied that the steps were undertaken and it is necessary to refer to three matters only. 8 First, s 191(2)(c) of the Act required an approved summary of each scheme to be given to every affected policy holder.
 On that basis, I was satisfied that confirmation of the Lifetime Scheme will not affect the likelihood of the practice of granting policy loans being reinstated. 28 Mr Bray also submitted to the Court that he held general concerns regarding the standards of communication between Lifetime and MLC and policy holders.
 In particular, Mr Bray noted that neither Lifetime nor MLC had disclosed to Lifetime policy holders that the effect of the Lifetime Scheme was to reverse an earlier scheme, confirmed by the Court in 1997, whereby MLC transferred part of its life insurance business to Lifetime.
