 Do the allegations in the statement of claim give rise to an arguable challenge to the removal of the applicant from Australia? 40 In view of the submissions, the questions here are whether the issue of reasonable practicability is a jurisdictional fact and, if so, whether an erroneous finding of fact means that what is otherwise a privative clause decision may be set aside as being beyond power?
 It is not suggested by the applicant that the decision to remove him from Australia falls within any of those paragraphs, and, therefore, this Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to the proposed removal of the applicant from Australia because it is a privative clause decision as the pleadings presently stand or, even if the applicant is able to plead an arguable case of jurisdictional error of the relevant type, a purported privative clause decision.
