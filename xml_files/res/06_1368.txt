 Nor is it open to an officer to consider whether the unlawful non-citizen's removal and return to a particular country is conformable with the obligation against refoulment is Art 33(1) of the Convention. 34 In the context of considering the Court's supervisory jurisdiction, the Court addressed the question of whether removing or refusing to remove an unlawful non-citizen under s 198(6) was a privative clause decision within s 474 of the Migration Act .
 Do the allegations in the statement of claim give rise to an arguable challenge to the removal of the applicant from Australia? 40 In view of the submissions, the questions here are whether the issue of reasonable practicability is a jurisdictional fact and, if so, whether an erroneous finding of fact means that what is otherwise a privative clause decision may be set aside as being beyond power?
 It is not suggested by the applicant that the decision to remove him from Australia falls within any of those paragraphs, and, therefore, this Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to the proposed removal of the applicant from Australia because it is a privative clause decision as the pleadings presently stand or, even if the applicant is able to plead an arguable case of jurisdictional error of the relevant type, a purported privative clause decision.
 In my opinion, this means that not only does this Court not have original jurisdiction to determine a claim that his removal would be beyond power or ultra vires, but also it does not have original jurisdiction to grant an injunction on the alternative basis of restraining the commission of a tort. 52 The original jurisdiction previously exercised by this Court in relation to migration decisions is, subject to certain exceptions, now vested in the Federal Magistrates Court.
