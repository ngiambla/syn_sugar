 On 20 September 2006 the Full Court ordered that the appeal be allowed and that there be judgment in favour of the appellants against Lane Moller Partners Pty Limited trading as Lane Moller Partners and against Robert Young, the third and fourth respondents to the appeal respectively, in the sum of $200,135, together with interest in the sum of $121,876.31.
 Accordingly, leave to proceed was not required. 7 However, in Skinner v Jeogla Pty Ltd (2001) 37 ACSR 106, which arose out of an application to the court for leave to proceed against a company in liquidation brought under s 471B of the Corporations Law , the New South Wales Court of Appeal doubted the correctness of Humber .
 In addition, the application for security for costs in BPM was regarded as a "defensive proceeding" and it was "open to argument" that the appeal in Skinner could not be so categorised. 10 Powell JA, the third member of the Court of Appeal, though he did not express a concluded view upon the matter, was inclined to think leave to proceed was not required in the context of an appeal.
 By implication, he regarded BPM as supporting the conclusion that, in the case of an appeal, leave to proceed was not required. 11 Ultimately, in Skinner , the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to determine whether, in the context of an appeal, leave to proceed was required.
