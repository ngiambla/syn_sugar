 The Tribunal also pointed, to what it described as unconvincing, the request of a human rights organisation which was said to have requested him to testify at an inquiry into the foregoing incident, observing that it was inconceivable that all of the claimed threats were conveyed by means of messages communicated to the appellant by third parties, during which the appellant remained 'interference free'.
 The Applicant submit [sic] that the Tribunal's adoption of the Applicants oral evidence adversely and inconsistently against the Applicant's Statement of Claims that was made to the Delegate of the first Respondent was contrary to the correct assessment that was required under the law relating to sec 424A of the Migration Act 1958 .
 The second was that the Federal Magistrate erred in law, and failed to judicially review the appellant's claims purportedly made under s 414 of the Act, by coming to the conclusion that the only adverse findings of the Tribunal related to the contradiction between the independent country information and the appellant's claims.
