 His Honour dismissed the existence of any basis for the suggestion that the Tribunal misled the applicant, 'or even that the Tribunal had any understanding that the [first appellant] may have some misapprehension as to the view the Tribunal was taking of his evidence' . 10 Moreover Nicholls FM dismissed the appellants' allegation of denial of natural justice, either in the statutory context or otherwise, his Honour additionally referring in that regard to the operation of s 422B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').
 Moreover his Honour pointed to the absence of any 'exceptional circumstances which would serve to require the Tribunal to make... enquiries... nor [are there] any such circumstances evident on the material before [the Tribunal], referring thereby to the well known observation of Wilcox J in Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 170.
