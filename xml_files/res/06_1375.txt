 The purpose of the admission of the affidavits as considered by his Honour 21 I do not accept that factually it is the case that French J has admitted the affidavits of Professors Garnaut and Walker for the purpose of construing plain and ordinary terms in the PRRTA Act.
 At [44] he stated that the accounting treatment which Woodside adopted and Professor Walker's evidence was said to provide useful assistance in confirming the existence of the necessary connection between the sale of petroleum and the payment of hedge expenses, although of course the accounting treatment would not be determinative of the issue.
 These latter references seem to me to demonstrate the possible relevance of the evidence of Professors Garnaut and Walker to the application of the PRRTA Act after the scope of the words 'in relation to' have been determined in the context of that Act and with regard to its purpose.
