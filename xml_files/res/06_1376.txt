 The second question before me is whether Helimount should be granted leave under s 459S. 8 By reason of Helimount's failure to comply with the statutory demand it is presumed to be insolvent: s 459C(2) of the Corporations Act .
 It seeks to establish that it is not insolvent and whether it has discharged the onus of proving that it is not insolvent is the third question before me. 9 I turn to examine the facts established on the evidence before me and I start with the facts surrounding the debt allegedly owed by Helimount to Web Wealth.
