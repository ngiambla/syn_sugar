 Helimount did not apply under s 459G of the Corporations Act for an order setting aside the statutory demand. 3 The statutory demand was served on the registered office of Helimount on or about 28 November 2005 and the application by Web Wealth for a winding up order was made on 31 January 2006.
 The second question before me is whether Helimount should be granted leave under s 459S. 8 By reason of Helimount's failure to comply with the statutory demand it is presumed to be insolvent: s 459C(2) of the Corporations Act .
 It seeks to establish that it is not insolvent and whether it has discharged the onus of proving that it is not insolvent is the third question before me. 9 I turn to examine the facts established on the evidence before me and I start with the facts surrounding the debt allegedly owed by Helimount to Web Wealth.
 Leave should not be granted in relation to the grounds which bear on the principal amount because even on a preliminary consideration there is no genuine dispute in relation to the principal amount and, furthermore, Helimount's explanation for not applying to set aside the statutory demand is unsatisfactory.
