 The first is that when the cause of action arose, the person personally liable on the claim was the owner or charterer or the person in possession or control of the ship.
 The contest is whether this condition is met. 2 There is also an application by Pan Australia, which is in voluntary administration, that the leave granted to bring the action in rem be revoked.
 Failure by the Charterers to pay hire within [that period] shall entitle the Owners to withdraw the Vessel from the service of the Charterers and terminate the Charter without further notice. " 5 Clause 29 dealt with repossession in the event of termination.
 To my mind it is clear that this is not a form of notice where the equivocation can be cured by what a charterer is deemed to know or is required to find out.
