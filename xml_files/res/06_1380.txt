 They submitted that their evidence to the Tribunal confirmed that they were in need of both emotional and financial support from the deceased, and that he was the only person in the family who was employed and who provided constant comfort, gifts, financial support and contributions.
 The appellants also relied on the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Cornish and Commissioner for Superannuation (1987) 18 ALD 418. 20 The respondent resisted the appellants' contention that the term "Dependant" as defined in the trust deed extended to emotional dependence and contended that the notion of dependency in the trust deed was limited to financial dependency.
 The appellants submitted that the intention of the Complaints Act is to place the Tribunal in the shoes of the trustee when making a determination in respect of a complaint and, under s 37(1) of the Act, the Tribunal was vested with all the powers, obligations and discretions of the trustee.
