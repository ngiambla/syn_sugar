 The appeal, although said by Mr Singh to be brought pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), was actually brought pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (" AAT Act "), and is confined to questions of law.
 Eventually, Mr Singh withdrew that application and, as the Tribunal records (at [5]), consented to the matter proceeding before Mr Handley. 27 In its reasons for decision, the Tribunal set out in some detail the history of Mr Singh's attempts to avoid having to repay the various sums totalling $88,633.34.
 It referred to the "repetitious appeals" lodged by Mr Singh as having no merit, and to the order of Ryan J on 8 March 2006 that the most recent application to this Court not be accepted because it amounted to an abuse of process.
