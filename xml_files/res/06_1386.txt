 On or about 15 September 2005, the First respondent by its servant or agent Carl Moller wrote and published of and concerning the First applicant the letter (hereafter "The FYG email"), a copy of which is annexed hereto as the Third Schedule.
 Accordingly, I would answer question 20 in the negative. 33 In relation to question 21, the applicants concede that if question 20 is answered in the negative, it would follow that question 21 should also be answered in that way.
 Independently of that concession, I could not conclude that in respect of directors of NAGS, other than the second applicant, the email was capable of giving rise to an imputation that any of them are likely to be imprisoned for taxation crimes.
