 On 28 November 2002, O'Loughlin J dismissed the application (the second Federal Court decision). 5 On 24 December 2002 the appellant sought constitutional writ relief in the High Court of Australia in relation to the second Tribunal decision.
 It was the failure of the learned Judge in that he erred to rule that the RRT was bound to take cognisance of the political culture of the JVP and this failure resulted in jurisdiction error.
 The learned judge erred in that he did not rule that the RRT did commit jurisdictional error in its failure to take into account this most relevant information, although it was bound to have taken such information into account.
 I submit respectfully that I was not re agitating facts but only pleading that on the incidents accepted to have occurred by the RRT, the RRT failed to take them into consideration when bound to do so and thus committed jurisdictional error.
