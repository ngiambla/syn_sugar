 On 23 March 2005 the Tribunal had a hearing at which the appellant gave evidence and on 7 April 2005 it refused his application for review. 4 The appellant identified some errors in the dates which the trial judge gave for certain events in paragraph [2] of the judgment under appeal.
 It is clear from the decisions of the High Court of Australia that the window for correction of errors in what the Tribunal did is narrow: see Abebe v Commonwealth Re Minister for Immigraiton [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at p 534 [50] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J; Re Minister for Immigraiton and Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at p 409 [7] per McHugh J. 9 In Plaintiff S157 of 2002 v Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at p 506 [76] Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said that an administrative decision which involves jurisdictional error is regarded in law as no decision at all.
 I am not sure whether the appellant intended to connote anything more than he believed that the result was wrong and that the trial judge should not have found, as he did, that the Tribunal's decision revealed no error amenable to correction. 12 I have examined the material in the appeal papers including his Honour's judgment.
 At the conclusion of the Tribunal's hearing, the member allowed a further week for further submissions including translations of documents which were in the appellant's native language and which he had sought to put before the Tribunal at the hearing but had not, because of their not being in English, been able to be received.
