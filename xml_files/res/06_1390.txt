 For that reason, and because they had no personal interest in the proceeding, I am prepared to order that these costs be paid as between solicitor and client, and that they have priority as though governed by s 109(1)(a) of the Act. 6 The applicant seeks its costs of the proceeding, subsequent to the first directions hearing on 13 June 2006, from the second respondent on a solicitor/client basis.
 He says that the applicant's claim was of such an order, and potentially of such significant impact on the estate as a whole, as to warrant careful investigation by the court, and that his active role as contradictor facilitated that.
 For these reasons, I propose not to make any costs order in favour of the applicant beyond that which obliges the second respondent. 9 The second respondent seeks that his costs be paid out of the estate 'with priority'.
