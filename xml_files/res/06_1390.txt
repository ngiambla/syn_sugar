 For that reason, and because they had no personal interest in the proceeding, I am prepared to order that these costs be paid as between solicitor and client, and that they have priority as though governed by s 109(1)(a) of the Act. 6 The applicant seeks its costs of the proceeding, subsequent to the first directions hearing on 13 June 2006, from the second respondent on a solicitor/client basis.
 It points to a number of respects in which, it contends, the second respondent's conduct of the proceeding was unreasonable, such as requiring discovery, and requiring the attendance of a witness from overseas, in relation to transactions by or involving the applicant which appeared ex facie regular and which the second respondent had no disclosed reason to impugn.
 He says that the applicant's claim was of such an order, and potentially of such significant impact on the estate as a whole, as to warrant careful investigation by the court, and that his active role as contradictor facilitated that.
 For these reasons, I propose not to make any costs order in favour of the applicant beyond that which obliges the second respondent. 9 The second respondent seeks that his costs be paid out of the estate 'with priority'.
