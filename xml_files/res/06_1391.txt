 The disclosure or discovery of the documents which I have indicated I will order should make clear those circumstances or considerations which were not taken into account or, at least, will do all that can be done to establish that proposition.
 I do not think that was pressed in oral argument, but even it were, it seems to me to provide no basis at all for discovery going beyond the documents which I have indicated should be provided. 9 So for those reasons, I do not propose to make any present order about discovery beyond that previously foreshadowed.
