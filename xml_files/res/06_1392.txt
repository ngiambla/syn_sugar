 I do not propose to repeat the reasons for judgment given by the learned Federal Magistrate. 3 Counsel for IPS does not dispute, for the purpose of this application, the finding made by his Honour that there is a serious question to be tried or the finding on balance of convenience.
 However, Mr Arthur contends that orders 2 and 3 were made in breach of the principles which govern the grant of injunctive relief under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) as recently considered and explained by a Full Court in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135. 4 In particular, Mr Arthur submits that it was not appropriate to make orders 2 and 3 because there was no sufficient nexus demonstrated between the contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and the conduct which is the subject of orders 2 and 3.
 Alternatively he submits that there was no evidence from which his Honour could draw that conclusion. 5 It seems to me that the learned Federal Magistrate must be taken in [24] and [25] of his reasons to have found that there was a threat to continue to make the implied representation which his Honour found to have been made in [11] and which gave rise to the exercise of the learned Federal Magistrate's discretion to grant injunctive relief.
 I'm satisfied that there was evidence, in particular in the affidavit of Ms Klitogiannis, to support that finding. 6 Whilst it would certainly have been open to the learned Federal Magistrate to decline to make orders 2 and 3; see for example Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (2000) 173 ALR 702 at [152] to [153], I can see no error of principle by the learned Federal Magistrate in deciding upon the evidence before him that orders 2 and 3 were appropriate within the principles referred to by the Full Court in Foster .
