 1 What is presently before the Court is a Notice of Motion filed in Court this morning, made returnable instanter, in which a number of prayers for final relief were recorded which it was intended by the applicants to seek in the event that the respondent failed to appear at the appointed time for the directions hearing at 9:30 am today.
 When the matter came before the Court at 5 pm, the proposed order requiring an affidavit to be filed and served by the respondent was modified and short minutes of order were handed up, which set out the modified form of order sought. 3 The order sought was set out in paragraph 5 of the short minutes of order under the heading ' Norwich Pharmacal Relief ', which I understand to be a reference to the decision of the House of Lords in Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] AC 133 ('Norwich Pharmacal').
 In a parallel situation in relation to Mareva relief, the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Ross v Internet Wines Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 195 ; (2004) 60 NSWLR 436, held that it was inappropriate for a court to require a person to create a document, the contents of which may tend to incriminate the person, whether there be an arrangement for the document to be placed in a sealed envelope and made available to the relevant Judge's associate with a claim for privilege or not. 13 It seems to me that in the circumstances of this case, it would be entirely inappropriate to order the respondent to provide an affidavit such as the one sought in the proposed prayer for relief to which I have referred.
