 However, there are some exceptions to this, including if you go to a country with which Australia has an international social security agreement. 3 On 19 April 2004, the appellant contacted Centrelink, after receipt of that letter, and he was advised that as long as he did not return to Australia to live, the new rules relating to disability support pensions, commencing 1 July 2004, would not apply to him.
 On 9 March 2005, the appellant appealed against that decision to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ('SSAT') and on 5 April 2005, the SSAT affirmed the decision under review. 5 The appellant then appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') and by decision dated 12 December 2005 the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review.
 The first is whether the advice given by the Centrelink officer on 19 April 2004 was incorrect, and if so, given that the appellant relied on it in returning to Australia, whether the respondent is now estopped from refusing to determine that the appellant's maximum portability period for disability support pension is an unlimited period. 10 The second issue is a matter of statutory interpretation of cl 135 sch 1A of the Act.
 The Tribunal notes that Mr Rajcinoski did not contact Centrelink on his arrival in Australia or before 1 July 2004 to seek clarification of the new rules or the contents of the letter dated 5 April 2004. 12 The appellant contended that the findings of the Tribunal in these paragraphs were wrong, and that upon the basis of the alleged incorrect advice given by Centrelink, the appellant returned to Australia.
