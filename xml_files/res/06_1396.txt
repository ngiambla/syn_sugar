 The Tribunal notes that Mr Rajcinoski did not contact Centrelink on his arrival in Australia or before 1 July 2004 to seek clarification of the new rules or the contents of the letter dated 5 April 2004. 12 The appellant contended that the findings of the Tribunal in these paragraphs were wrong, and that upon the basis of the alleged incorrect advice given by Centrelink, the appellant returned to Australia.
