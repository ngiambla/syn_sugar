 He noted that a number of the matters raised by Mr Siminton had been agitated before another judge of this Court, Merkel J, earlier this year: Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 2) [2006] FCA 336.
 If it turned out that there was no evidence to support APRA's claims, Mr Siminton could then move for summary judgment. 4 The principles upon which leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment will be granted are clear.
 It was submitted that there could not be a contravention of s 7 of the Banking Act without both receipt of depositors' money, and lending of that money. 7 In response, Mr Hibble, on behalf of APRA, submitted that APRA had evidence of lending, and would produce that evidence in accordance with any timetable laid down by Tracey J.
 If APRA cannot produce evidence to support the allegation contained in paragraph 5(a), that may mean that its claim against Mr Siminton for having contravened s 7 of the Banking Act will fail, and that point can be addressed by way of an application for summary judgment.
