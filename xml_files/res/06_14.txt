 They further submit that the questions in the Amended Statement of Claim do not turn upon the issue of ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks but are founded either in contract (the SPI Trade Mark Claims and the New Contractual Claims) or under ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the TPA (the Ruski Claims); SPI Spirits and Spirits International do not rely upon their ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks in support of any of these claims; and irrespective of the outcome of the Cross-Claim, SPI Spirits and Spirits International will be entitled to pursue and intend to pursue these claims against Diageo.
 Ms Everett, in her affidavit, has said that, based on her experience and her knowledge of the matter, extensive evidence is likely to be required in relation to these claims and has expressed the view that discovery in relation to the claims is also likely to be considerable and onerous given the length of time during which Diageo sold Diageo Stolichnaya Vodka and has sold Ruski. (5) There would be no prejudice to SPI Spirits and Spirits International if the Ruski Claims were not heard until after the determination of the Cross-Claim for the following reasons: (a) Diageo commenced sale of Ruski in the current Ruski get-up in April 2004.
 SPI Spirits and Spirits International's standing to bring the Ruski Claims is not in any way contingent upon Spirits International's past or present ownership of, or rights in, the Cross-Claim Trade Marks. (2) It is admitted by Diageo in its defence, inter alia , that from 1996, Diageo distributed vodka in Australia under the Stolichnaya trade mark pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement with SPI Spirits and its predecessors.
 In particular, on SPI Spirits and Spirits International's case, Diageo is continuing to engage in the allegedly misleading and deceptive conduct, through its continuing distribution of Ruski in Australia in the livery which is the subject of the Ruski Claims. (6) Given the nature of these claims, it can be anticipated that both parties will wish to adduce consumer and/or survey evidence relating to the matters in issue in the Ruski Claims.
