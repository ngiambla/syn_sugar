 I am satisfied that it would be appropriate to enjoin the respondent from receiving money from members of the public, by way of deposit in the Terra Nova Cache or the Principality of Camside, from assuming or using the words 'bank', 'banker' or 'banking' or any words or phrases of like import in relation to his business, and from advertising or representing or stating that he will carry on the business of banking. 11 It is also appropriate, in my view, to make orders endeavouring to ensure that any assets over which the respondent does have control will be frozen effectively.
 I have some disquiet about that, because the material before me is absolutely silent as to what other sources of funds the respondent may have available to him, and as to what means he may have of meeting his legal costs and of discharging his living expenses, without resort to any of the frozen assets.
 Until the hearing and determination of the proceeding, the respondent ensure that there is published on the first page that a user views when he or she accesses: (a) any current, proposed or future internet site that uses the name 'Principality of Camside', 'Terra Nova Cache', or any derivation thereof; and (b) any other internet site controlled by the respondent; a notice in the form set out in Schedule 1. 4.
