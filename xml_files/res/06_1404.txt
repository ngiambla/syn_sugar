 The notice stated that the meeting would be held at 9.30am on 16 June 2006 at Warragul and stipulated that the business of the meeting would be '[t]o consider a resolution that the Directors approve the company commencing legal proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia forthwith, in the form of the attached Statement of Claim and Application'.
 They advised that the appointed time for the meeting of Friday 16 June 2006 at Warragul did not give the Deans sufficient time to arrange their attendance, especially as Mr Dean was interstate and would not be returning before approximately 20 July 2006.
 In view of Vogrig and WVL's past conduct and their retainer to act for Landmark and the Porchs, there is a fundamental difficulty in WVL continuing to act for GSS against the Dean interests, when GSS represents the beneficial interests of both Landmark and the Dean interests.
