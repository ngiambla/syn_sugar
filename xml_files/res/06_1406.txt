 There does not appear to be any dispute that, at the time, Mr Summerville was properly served with the relevant notice of listing by the Tribunal, or that, as a result for the purposes of s 68AA(1), the appellant was properly served with that notice. 5.
 It is very clear that critical issues for the appellant in the reinstatement proceedings on 27 October 2005 were the merits of the substantive application which had been dismissed on 2 September 2005, and why the appellant had not appeared at the hearing of 2 September 2005. 6. 7.
 There was evidence before the Tribunal that the notice of listing for the hearing of 2 September 2005 had been communicated in multiple ways to the appellant and that the appellant was not only claiming lack of awareness of the notice of listing, but apparently --- as indicated by the fact that its counsel was taken by surprise by this fact --- was unaware that its representative had forwarded the notice.
