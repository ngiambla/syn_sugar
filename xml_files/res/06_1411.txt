 1 This is the hearing of an objection to competency in respect of an appeal by Ronald Bunting concerning a decision of Federal Magistrate Jarrett on 26 June this year dismissing an application by Mr Bunting for an extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') of 22 February this year.
 That section requires that: '24 Appellate Jurisdiction ... (1A) An appeal shall not be brought from a judgment referred to in subsection (1) that is an interlocutory judgment unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal. ' 3 No application for leave to appeal has ever been made in respect of that judgment.
 The position simply is that if the orders from which the appeal is brought are interlocutory, then leave is required and an appeal brought without leave is incompetent. 4 The Federal Magistrate's decision to dismiss the application for an extension of time was an interlocutory judgment.
 I was referred to authorities concerning the meaning of interlocutory judgment, including Brouwer v Titan Corporation Ltd Ors (1997) 149 ALR 50 at p 53, Licul v Corney (1976) 50 ALJR 439 at p 444, and Computer Edge Pty Ltd v Apple Computer Inc [1984] HCA 47 ; (1984) 54 ALR 767.
