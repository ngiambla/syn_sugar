 That section requires that: '24 Appellate Jurisdiction ... (1A) An appeal shall not be brought from a judgment referred to in subsection (1) that is an interlocutory judgment unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal. ' 3 No application for leave to appeal has ever been made in respect of that judgment.
 I was referred to authorities concerning the meaning of interlocutory judgment, including Brouwer v Titan Corporation Ltd Ors (1997) 149 ALR 50 at p 53, Licul v Corney (1976) 50 ALJR 439 at p 444, and Computer Edge Pty Ltd v Apple Computer Inc [1984] HCA 47 ; (1984) 54 ALR 767.
