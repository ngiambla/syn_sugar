 What ASIC wants is for the receiver to carry out an investigation that will identify all scheme assets, all debts incurred during the operation of each scheme and all contributions in cash or in kind made by the investors.
 In particular, I do not accept that the section permits the court to impose an otherwise nonexistent obligation on a person to provide information to a receiver appointed to wind up a managed investment scheme.
