 In support of his contention, Mr McDonald relies upon his sworn denial that he did not sign the Valuation and that he did not prepare it. 14 The issue turns upon whether further facts surrounding the circumstances in which Mr O'Boyle apparently came to sign the Valuation give rise to a triable issue.
 This depends solely upon whether the claim that Mr McDonald owed a duty of care to Colonial can go to trial. 17 The other basis on which the cross-claim is attacked is that it claims accessory liability under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act without satisfying the requirements of knowledge of the falsity of the representation which is said to underpin the claims.
