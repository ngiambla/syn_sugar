 1 The appellant appeals from the judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith in which his application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was rejected.
 On one occasion he claimed that he was arrested there and allowed to return to Taiwan on the condition that he collected information for the Chinese secret service on Falun Gong practices.
 He also said that he tried to stop his spying activities but Chinese authorities threatened the quality of life of his sister who resides in mainland China. 3 The appellant's statement in support of his application for refugee status did not clearly articulate which religion he observed, apart from saying that he liked Falun Gong.
 The Tribunal then determined the matter pursuant to s 426A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) without taking any further action to enable the appellant to appear before it. 5 The Tribunal found the appellant's claims to be lacking in detail.
