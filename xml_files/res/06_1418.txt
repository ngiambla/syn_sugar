 The Applicants on behalf of the Dingaal claim group included Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie. (i) On 14 April 2003, at a meeting held at Hope Vale of claim group members, resolutions were passed that had the effect of removing the authority of Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie to make a claim for and act as applicants in connection with the native title claim on behalf of the claim group.
 The meeting was attended by the applicants on behalf of the claim group, family representatives of the claim group, CYLC representatives, NNTT representatives and Dr Fiona Powell. 10 Based upon the presentation by NNTT representatives and a presentation concerning an anthropological overview of research conducted in the claim area by Dr Powell, the claim group, having considered those matters overnight on 28 February 2006, unanimously resolved to amend the Dingaal native title claim and include other groups, namely, Thanil, Nguuruumungu, Gulaal, Ngaatha and Thittaar.
 Please see Part B on page 2 that sets out the time table for meetings, anthropological work and amending the application. ...' 12 On 17 October 2006, the CYLC wrote to Gordon Charlie enclosing the Notice of Meeting of clan members to consider and, if thought appropriate, authorise the amendment of the Native Title Application to include other groups and make any other amendments to the Application that might arise.
