 Paragraph 15 would allege that the SIRT 1 applications were filed without the knowledge, approval or authority of the University and were in respect of a 'patentable invention developed and/or discovered while Dr Gray was an employee of the University'. 10 In proposed par 16 it would be alleged that, by making and maintaining the SIRT 2 application and causing or procuring Sirtex to make each of the SIRT 1 applications, Dr Gray breached his fiduciary duties to the University.
 Paragraph 17 would assert constructive trusts in relation to any rights or entitlements received by Dr Gray and Sirtex in relation to SIRT 2 and SIRT 1. 11 In a new par 19A it would be alleged that, on or about 25 October 2001 Dr Gray caused or procured Sirtex to file and Sirtex did file the SIRT 1 PCT Application.
 It also notes that discovery by Sirtex has already been given in relation to SIRT 1. 15 Dr Gray relies upon an affidavit of Cinzia Lee Donald sworn 16 October 2006 as establishing that patent registration for SIRT 1 has been finally refused by the United States Patent and Trade Mark Office (USPTO) on the ground of prior disclosure.
 The introduction of SIRT 1 would take the inquiry back to 1983 and earlier and an inquiry into what was happening at the University of Melbourne prior to Dr Gray's employment at the University by reference to prior art there developed. 24 In answer counsel for the University contends that the factual implications are not large.
