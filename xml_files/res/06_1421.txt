 The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs not to grant the applicant a protection visa. 2 The applicant, who is a citizen of the People's Republic of China, arrived in Australia on 11 October 2005.
 On 14 February 2006, the Tribunal handed down and sent to the applicant a copy of its decision dated 23 January 2006, affirming the delegate's decision not to grant a protection visa.
 The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application pursuant to rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth), with costs fixed in the sum of $2000. 3 The applicant did not attend the Tribunal hearing.
 Further, no substantial injustice arises from a refusal to grant leave given that the Tribunal's reasons for decision do not disclose any jurisdictional error. 6 In the original application for leave to appeal, the applicant named a single respondent.
