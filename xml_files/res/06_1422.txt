 He applies for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Federal Magistrate Driver published on 22 June 2006 in which his Honour dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.
 His Honour found the applicant did not attend court for the previous hearing and even if he had, he took a conscious decision not to enter the courtroom when his name was called.
 The Tribunal also considered it relevant that the applicant, although claiming to be a political dissident whose colleagues were sentenced to prison terms, did not "bring the plight of these colleagues to the attention of human rights organisations".
 Leave will not be granted unless the judgment below is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration on appeal and unless substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the judgment to be wrong. 7 I do not consider that the judgment of Driver FM is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration on appeal.
