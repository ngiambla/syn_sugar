 1 This matter gives rise to a very narrow issue, namely, the issue of payment of costs in respect of an appeal of a decision of a Federal Magistrate which subsequently has been set aside and whether costs should follow the event. 2 On 27 February 2006 the appellant filed a notice of appeal from a decision of Jarrett FM of 6 February 2006, wherein the learned Federal Magistrate had dismissed the appellant's application and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of and incidental to that application.
 On 28 August 2006, Jarrett FM made orders setting aside his orders of 6 February 2006, that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to its application filed 14 June 2006, and that the Migration Review Tribunal be joined as a second respondent to those proceedings.
 Irrespective of this, the respondent has been put to expense by legal proceedings in the form of this appeal, and this appeal has now been rendered nugatory by the appellant successfully applying to have the original judgment set aside and a fresh application determined by the Federal Magistrates Court. 14 Before me this morning Mr Boccabella pressed that the appellant's case has merit, and that this should influence my approach to making a costs order in this matter.
