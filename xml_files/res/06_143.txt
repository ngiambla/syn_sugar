 This document was subsequently signed by Mr Fowle and an officer of the Hydro. 10 On 27 July 1996 Mr Tony Mihelcic of the Commonwealth Department of Administrative Services (DAS) faxed to Mr McVilly two documents, one of which was entitled "Work Trial Proposal" and the other "Work Trial Agreement".
 By a letter dated 22 April 1997 to Mr Mihelcic the Hydro offered to place Mr Fowle for a period of up to six months "to facilitate him achieving the qualification of A Grade lineworker".
 The Commonwealth and Comcare by their subsequent conduct, and in particular by meeting all Mr Fowle's wages notwithstanding that he was doing work for the Hydro, impliedly accepted the terms in the Work Trial Agreement.
