 Mr Zrilic says that once the valuation was received it was his practice to read the valuation, consider whether the property described in the valuation was consistent with the pre-approved details contained on the R D Input Sheet and then complete the data input sheet.
 However, Mr Lowis said the word 'fair' as a comment on marketability was a word he ought not to have used because he was unaware of and had not studied the marketability of the property at the time of preparing the model valuation.
