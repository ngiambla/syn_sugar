 Mr Zrilic says that once the valuation was received it was his practice to read the valuation, consider whether the property described in the valuation was consistent with the pre-approved details contained on the R D Input Sheet and then complete the data input sheet.
 However, Mr Lowis said the word 'fair' as a comment on marketability was a word he ought not to have used because he was unaware of and had not studied the marketability of the property at the time of preparing the model valuation.
 Mr Lowis was asked by counsel for the respondents to focus on the notion that marketability in Section 1 was directed to a design feature which might affect marketability rather than saleability or comparative sales and, in effect, buyer substitution possibilities.
