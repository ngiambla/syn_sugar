 The amended statement of claim --- uncontested facts 13 According to the amended statement of claim, from a date unknown to the applicants, Mrs Hasluck imported for sale films in DVD format which bore trade marks substantially identical with, and/or similar to those of the applicants.
 This conduct, without the licence or authority of the applicants, constituted an infringement of their trade marks. 14 Mr Hasluck was said to have manufactured, imported for sale, advertised for sale, supplied and/or sold DVD films under or by reference to marks substantially identical with and/or deceptively similar to the applicants' trade marks.
 During that period Mr Hasluck sold a total of 608 DVDs on eBay. 30 Of the DVD titles delivered up, two belonged to Paramount; 26 to Fox; none to Disney; 14 to Universal and 6 to Columbia.
