 After a decision by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the Minister') the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') found the application was not valid because certain details had not been provided in the application.
 As a result, the Tribunal ignored or field [sic] to consider an aspect of the applicant's claim, giving rise to jurisdictional error. ' 9 Scarlett FM rejected the first ground because the independent country information being referred to is excepted (under s 424A(3)(a)) from the requirement under s 424(A)(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) that it be notified to the applicant. 10 The second ground was rejected as a challenge to a factual finding rather than a jurisdictional issue.
 It raises no jurisdictional issue bearing upon the application for judicial review. 12 The appeal to this Court made general allegations that Scarlett FM had erred in not finding jurisdictional error and procedural fairness. 13 At the hearing I invited the applicant on three occasions to make submissions in support of the appeal but he indicated that he had nothing to add to the material already before the court. 14 No error in the decision of Scarlett FM has been shown or, to my mind, appears from the papers.
 In my view his Honour had no alternative but to dismiss the application for judicial review which was before him and this Court must dismiss the appeal from his decision. 15 The appeal will be dismissed with costs. 16 At the conclusion of the hearing Mr Chami, appearing for the respondent, asked me, if I dismissed the appeal, to make a costs order fixed in an amount of $3,000.
