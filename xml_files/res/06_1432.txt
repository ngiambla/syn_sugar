 After a decision by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the Minister') the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') found the application was not valid because certain details had not been provided in the application.
 In my view his Honour had no alternative but to dismiss the application for judicial review which was before him and this Court must dismiss the appeal from his decision. 15 The appeal will be dismissed with costs. 16 At the conclusion of the hearing Mr Chami, appearing for the respondent, asked me, if I dismissed the appeal, to make a costs order fixed in an amount of $3,000.
