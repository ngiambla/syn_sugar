 These were, first, that the appellant was not treated less favourably for the purpose of s 5 of the DD Act , and, secondly, that the defence of unjustifiable hardship could be made out.
 His Honour had been correct to simply conclude that because the service was not available, there was no need to construct a hypothetical comparator to determine whether the appellant was treated less favourably.
 In those circumstances it was necessary, in my opinion, for the appellant to lay the evidentiary foundation for a finding that the service could have been provided to the appellant notwithstanding that it might not have been able to be provided to others at the time she requested it.
