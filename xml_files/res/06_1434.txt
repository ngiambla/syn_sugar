 In these circumstances, as a practical matter, it was not sufficient for the appellant to rely upon protection of the key as the sole means of protection of the vehicle: protection of the vehicle against theft by somebody using a stolen key should have been undertaken.
 It is submitted that the onus in such circumstances lay on the bailee to show that doing more than protecting the key was not reasonably possible. 7 I agree with the respondents' submissions in this regard. 8 Reference was made by the appellant to the failure of A1 to call the person responsible for the overall management of A1 and for the safety of A1's vehicle and its keys, and in particular, Mr Symonds to explain if, when and how another key or keys had gone missing.
 In these circumstances there is no basis, especially not on appeal, for trying to construct some other case of contributory negligence. 10 It follows then that on the principal issue the appeal must fail. 11 The proceedings were constituted in the first instance with two applicants, the first of which was A1, the second being Ms Touma.
