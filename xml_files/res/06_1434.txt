 In these circumstances, as a practical matter, it was not sufficient for the appellant to rely upon protection of the key as the sole means of protection of the vehicle: protection of the vehicle against theft by somebody using a stolen key should have been undertaken.
 In these circumstances there is no basis, especially not on appeal, for trying to construct some other case of contributory negligence. 10 It follows then that on the principal issue the appeal must fail. 11 The proceedings were constituted in the first instance with two applicants, the first of which was A1, the second being Ms Touma.
