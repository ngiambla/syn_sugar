 The applicants resist that being done on a summary basis. 2 There are issues between the parties in the Supreme Court of New South Wales of a broad nature involving discretionary considerations invoked by the cause of action based on s 133F of the Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW).
 The Supreme Court is going to be in a much better position to do that than this Court, and I do not want to do things that might be thought to cause some embarrassment to the s 133F argument, as to which it sounds to me as if there might be things to be said on both sides. 3 The better course is to send the matter to the Supreme Court with this issue undetermined and let the parties decide what they want to do about it there.
 If the respondents want to pursue an application for summary judgment there they can; if they want simply to try to force the applicants to seek leave there in some way, they can; or if they want to just leave their arguments to another day and suffer the costs of this interlocutory application, the respondents can do that.
