(d) experiencing a severe stressor within the two years immediately before the clinical worsening of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse; ...
 These contrive the inquiry to be undertaken by a doctor in determining for the purposes of the SoP whether the disease is, or was, present at a particular time: cf Repatriation Commission v Cornelius [2002] FCA 750 at [26] ; or whether that disease, being present, had worsened.
 Whether there has been a clinical worsening of a particular depressive disorder --- and the Tribunal had to, but did not, identify which of the three possibilities it was considering - was a diagnostic question that addressed the features and symptoms of that disorder as defined in the SoP and required a clinical judgment be made.
