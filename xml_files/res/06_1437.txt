 THE FIRST SET OF AMENDMENTS 3 The evidence in support of this motion is that Errol Investments agreed to purchase certain land ('the Rothbury land') from Hunter Valley Estates Pty Ltd by agreement made on 4 December 1999 ('the Rothbury contract').
 The evidence of the solicitor who drafted the application and statement of claim in these proceedings is that at the time of drafting the pleadings he had not seen the Shellharbour Trust Deed. 9 The title of the purchaser as specified in the Rothbury contract is Errol Investments, without qualification.
 The beneficiary of the remainder of the Rothbury land ('the Shellharbour land') remained the Shellharbour Unit Trust. 12 An issue has been raised as to the identity of the beneficiaries for whom Errol Investments held the Rothbury land in trust.
 The respondents point to an apparent discrepancy between the minutes that authorise Errol Investments to purchase the whole of the Rothbury land in trust for the Shellharbour Unit Trust and the Vintage Trust which provides that part of the land is to be held in trust for Vintage. 13 The cause of action brought by Errol Investments in these proceedings is held on behalf of the beneficiaries of the Shellharbour Unit Trust.
