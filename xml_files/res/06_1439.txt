 The letter of comfort stated: Although the proposed distributor agreement between Exact and Hume does not represent an exclusive agreement for the Australian territory, we hereby would like to reconfirm that Exact currently does not have plans to open its own offices in Australia.
 This arises from the terms of Article 3(2), Article 21 and Exhibit A of the Distributorship Agreement. 13 Article 25 is an entire agreement clause and provides that any variation of the Distributorship Agreement shall not be binding unless made in writing and signed by the parties.
 Mr Leathem has given evidence that in the course of the discussions, Mr Patel of Exact assured him that even if a deal was not reached, ESA would only pursue clients who had offices in "multiple countries".
 This was done by obtaining details of Hume's customers on the portal. 20 The effect of Mr Urand's evidence in cross-examination was that ESA obtained details of Hume's customers, that is, those who were not obtaining software or maintenance directly from ESA, from the portal.
