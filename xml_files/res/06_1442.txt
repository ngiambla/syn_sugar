 The application was on two grounds: first, under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Act 1997 (Cth) ('the TTMR Act'), and second, under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('Tax Act'). 3 The Board refused Mr Aalders' application for registration under both Acts, and he applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') for review of that decision. 4 The Tribunal delivered its decision on 29 July 2005. 5 It is common ground that Mr Aalders is now registered as a tax agent in Queensland.
 The application by the Board to have Mr Aalders' appeal struck out prejudices every New Zealand educated chartered accountant in public practice, who in terms of the TTMR Act is entitled to practise in Australia and who is afforded educational and qualification equality by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. 10.
 The appellants sought to appeal the decision at first instance on the basis of issues including whether the respondent was eligible to be appointed to the position pro tem, whether the union could have filled the position by appointment a casual vacancy, and whether the appointment of the respondent had not been effectively revoked by a subsequent meeting.
 Further, notwithstanding Mr Aalders' submissions concerning Crowley v Tax Agents' Board of New South Wales (1989) 90 ATC 2005 and its undesirability as a precedent in reinforcing discriminatory treatment of New Zealand-educated chartered accountants, I am not persuaded that it is appropriate at this stage to revisit the approach taken in that case. 22 Indeed the last point in many ways crystallises the issue concerning whether there is a public interest in the Court hearing Mr Aalders' appeal.
