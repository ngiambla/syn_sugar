 Thus, the costs of the exercise or enforcement of BP's rights under the deed of option were not the subject of either clause. 32 Ringrow points to the fact that under its written demand, BP recited that it had incurred legal costs on account of the proceedings before Hely J and the appeals 'and its exercise of the [deed of] Option.
 BP'S ARGUMENT 33 BP argued that because Ringrow put in issue whether the deed of option constituted a penalty for breach of the POSA and connected that argument to BP's rights under SC 1.2(b) and (e), BP's costs of enforcement of the deed of option or its rights thereunder were caught by either cll A14.2(f) or A16.9(a).
 The rights in contest in the two appeals were solely to do with the deed of option and whether BP's exercise of its rights under that option amounted to a penalty imposed on Ringrow for its established defaults under or breaches of the POSA. 49 Critically, however, no order made in either of the appeals was sought or could have affected the provisions of, or powers, rights or remedies of the parties contained in the POSA.
 The arguments on penalties and the enforceability of the deed of option were merely a part of the occasion for BP's expenditure on all its costs in the trial. 70 The application of the words in cll A14.2 and A16.9 in the POSA to the facts of the trial is clear.
