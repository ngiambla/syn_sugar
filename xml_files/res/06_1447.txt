 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Buchanan J of 22 September 2006, which upheld an objection to the competency of an appeal to the Court pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act). 2 The decision appealed from was the refusal by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) to stay a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which had affirmed a decision of the delegate of the Minister to cancel the applicant's disability support pension pending hearing of the substantive appeal.
 The short ground of the decision of his Honour was that a decision to grant or not to grant a stay is not a decision for the purposes of s 44 of the AAT Act according to a long line of authority. 3 There is no serious reason for doubting the basis for the decision.
 The form of the notice of appeal to the Court, which was under consideration by his Honour, discloses no such error of principle. 4 His Honour considered whether the jurisdiction pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) might assist the applicant to side-step the line of authority referred to above, but, as his Honour indicated, no ground was advanced before him which would indicate any arguable basis for establishing jurisdictional error.
 For what it is worth, it seems to me the same thing can be said of any possible application of the Administrative Decisions Judicial Review Act 1977 (Cth). 5 Furthermore, the issue is likely to prove academic in the sense that a hearing of the substantive proceeding before the Tribunal is to take place in early December.
