 1 This is an application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court delivered on 13 June 2006 ( SZHKU Ors v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs Anor [2006] FMCA 842).
 Whilst one may have considerable personal sympathy for the applicants and, particularly, the young lady who has spoken today, I regret to say that, from the legal point of view, the case is absolutely hopeless and it is not appropriate to burden the respondent and the Court with a hopeless appeal. 5 Under the circumstances the application for an extension of time is dismissed.
