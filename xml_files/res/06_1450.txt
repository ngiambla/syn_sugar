 1 This is an application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court delivered on 13 June 2006 ( SZHKU Ors v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs Anor [2006] FMCA 842).
 However, for leave to be granted the applicants must also establish that there is a notice of appeal in proper form to file and that it discloses at least some argument with a possible chance of success on appeal. 2 That is the difficulty for these applicants.
 However, in addition to dealing with the stated grounds, which were rather inapt to raise any significant question, the learned Federal Magistrate went on to examine issues that may have been implied in those grounds or which might arise out of the Tribunal's decision in the case.
 Whilst one may have considerable personal sympathy for the applicants and, particularly, the young lady who has spoken today, I regret to say that, from the legal point of view, the case is absolutely hopeless and it is not appropriate to burden the respondent and the Court with a hopeless appeal. 5 Under the circumstances the application for an extension of time is dismissed.
