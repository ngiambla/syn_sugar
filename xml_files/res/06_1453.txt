 As a result, SIBT certified that you did not achieve at least satisfactory academic results for Semester 3, 2004. ' 12 He was further advised: 'This information is relevant to the review because it is a requirement of your visa that you comply with condition 8202.
 Condition 8202 requires that you achieve an academic result that is considered to be at least satisfactory by your education provider in each term or semester and that you attain an attendance record of at least 80% for the course or the term or semester if your course is structured in such a way.
 It also follows that if the visa holder does not comply with paragraphs (a) or (b) of condition 8202(3) then, again, the visa holder, even if the visa holder has complied with condition 8202, will have failed to comply with condition 8202. 27 That does not, however, mean that before the Minister can be satisfied that there has been a failure to comply with condition 8202 the Minister must address all of the matters in condition 8202(2) and (3).
