 The postal address provided was PO Box K412, Haymarket NSW 1240. 15 By letter dated 23 June 2004 which was forwarded to the appellant's postal address he was informed that his application for a protection visa had been refused.
 Such letter was returned unclaimed. 16 The letter of 23 June 2004 was apparently received by the appellant because on 30 July 2004 he applied to the Tribunal for a review of the decision of the delegate.
 The mailing address was changed to 160/422 Pitt Street, Sydney NSW 2000. 17 By letter dated 30 July 2004 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant at his mailing address, specified in the Application for Review acknowledging receipt of his application.
 Since no telephone number, mobile telephone number or facsimile number had been provided in the Application for Review the Tribunal had no other means of contacting the appellant. 19 In the absence of the appellant the Tribunal considered the application.
