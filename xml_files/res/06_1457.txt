 Such letter was not returned unclaimed and the 'Response to Hearing Invitation' form was not returned. 11 Accordingly the Tribunal proceeded to hear the appeal in the appellant's absence and by letter dated 13 January 2005 the Tribunal advised the appellant that the decision would be handed down on 2 February 2005.
 Since post was the method adopted for notification, the provisions of s 441C(4)(a) applies and the appellant is deemed to have received the invitation within seven working days from the date it was dispatched, namely 22 December 2004.
 The Tribunal could not grant a protection visa unless it was satisfied that the criteria for the grant of a protection visa were met: see SJSB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 225 at [15] - [16] .
