 1 This is an application by Midamarine Pty Ltd ('the applicant') seeking interlocutory orders restraining DMC International Pty Ltd ('DMC') and David Maxwell Corrick ('Mr Corrick') from infringing Registered Design 151872 ('the Registered Design') for an 'inflatable surfcraft', and from infringing copyright in a Warning Label that the directors of the applicant say they wrote.
 The fact that the Wavestar was left with Mr Corrick, the comparison of the two and the identity of the words used in the Warning on the back of the DMC surfmat and, in particular, ' the shape of this inflatable product is a Registered Design ', lead inevitably to the conclusion that the DMC product is a direct copy of the Wavestar. 13 The words on the Wavestar reflect the contention by Mr Arenson that the Wavestar is an embodiment of the Registered Design.
 I accept that it has been acknowledged that that application will be withdrawn or otherwise expunged. 17 The principles governing the grant of interlocutory relief are well established, and have recently been reaffirmed by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 (' O'Neill ') at pars 19 and 65 and following.
