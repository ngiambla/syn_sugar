 The Tribunal also stated that the Convention looked to the future and considered the reasonable willingness of the Indian authorities to take action against criminal acts. 6 The appellants sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision before the Federal Magistrates Court on grounds that there was jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision and provided three bases for their claims. 7 The appellants claimed that there was an 'over reliance' on the factual findings of the previous Tribunal and thus the second Tribunal failed to perform its duty under ss 414 and 415 of the Act.
 The Federal Magistrate held that whether or not the factual conclusion was correct was not a matter for judicial review. 9 In relation to the appellants' claim that the Tribunal failed to assess the first appellant's claim of being a member of the Akali Dal, the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal had considered it because the Tribunal did not accept the first appellant was a witness of truth and thus not a member of Akali Dal.
 In making this submission the appellants expressly abjure any allegation of bias on the part of the Tribunal members. 17 There is no authority either statutory or at common law, requiring a second or subsequent tribunal to be isolated from the history of an application; that is, not to have evidence of prior hearings, appeals and references for rehearing.
