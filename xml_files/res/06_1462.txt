 I will assume without deciding that to be the case and assume that leave is required. 10 If leave is required the application for leave ought to have been made within 21 days: O 52 r 5.
 Moreover, there is no prospect if leave were granted that an appeal could succeed. 11 The grounds of the application for leave to appeal do not refer to any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate.
 The orders sought in the proposed notice of appeal which are for the issue of the constitutional writs and an injunction are inappropriate for an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. 12 In my opinion, there is no prospect that if leave were granted the appeal would succeed.
