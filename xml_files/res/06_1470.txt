 TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS 4 The Tribunal rejected the appellant's application for a protection visa on the basis that it was not satisfied that there was a real chance the appellant would be subjected to serious harm for a Convention reason if he returned to China now or in the reasonably foreseeable future. 5 The Tribunal found the appellant's claims were very vague and general and lacked key details and key dates.
 In fact the Tribunal said: 'While the Applicant does not provide any evidence to support his claims, the Tribunal is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and accept that he has been involved in a limited way with Falun Gong in the past.
 I am not persuaded that this element of the Tribunal's reasoning was not open to it, and I do not consider that the point made by the Tribunal might give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. ' 15 An allegation of bias raises a serious issue and must be founded on facts sufficient to give rise to the inference: see SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2002) 194 ALR 749.
 The Court notes that consistent with the High Court's decision in SAAP and Another v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, the Refugee Review Tribunal should be joined as a second respondent. 24 The first respondent seeks an order that its costs be paid in the sum of $2400.
