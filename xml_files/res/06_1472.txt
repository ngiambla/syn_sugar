 They also claimed that Mr Pinchuk referred to Horizon as "just a $2 company" or said that he would "make it" a $2 company. 8 In his evidence Mr Pinchuk denied that such comments were ever made.
 For this reason, in the circumstances I am satisfied that the respondents should have some security for their costs in this proceeding. 11 For completeness, I note that while there are many other factors that may be relevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion, in my view none of these factors is relevant to this application.
 In this case however, it is a neutral factor; the respondents have conceded, for the purpose of this application only, that the applicant has made a bona fide claim with a reasonable prospect of success.
 I do not accept that Horizon, who initiated the proceeding and seeks, amongst other things, damages, is in this proceeding in substance in the position of a defendant. 12 In their notice of motion the respondents seek security for their costs in the amount of $83,720.
