 Does the fact that the Application for an Order of Review of the decision of the first respondent to obtain a search warrant, as specified in the first paragraph of the application, mean that the application is an application 'in relation to' that related criminal justice process decision? 49 Earlier in this judgment I considered the meaning of 'decision' and 'in connection with' in the context of s 9A(4)(a).
 To the extent that the decision of the first respondent to obtain a search warrant was a decision to which the Act applied (and I shall consider this point shortly in my judgment) there appears no dispute that the search warrant relates to events the subject of charges the applicant is currently facing in the courts.
 The application of the applicant for an order of review of that decision is also clearly 'in relation to' that decision. 71 In any event, Mr Porter for the first respondent also submitted that even if the applicant articulates his complaint as being in respect of the 'conduct' of the second respondent in issuing the warrant, s 9A(1) is relevant because the section applies not just to an application to review criminal justice process decisions, but to an application 'in relation to' a criminal justice process decision.
