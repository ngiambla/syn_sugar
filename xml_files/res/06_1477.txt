 In SZBSZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 779 Bennett J considered the circumstance in which an applicant claimed his migration agent had acted without consultation or instructions and in consequence an invitation to attend a Tribunal hearing was declined.
 The Court, having heard evidence from both the appellant and the agent, was satisfied that the appellant had appointed the agent and that the agent had acted in accordance with her actual authority in signing a response to the invitation to attend the hearing.
 However, the Court will nevertheless state its observations. 31 The appellant also challenges the finding of Nicholls FM that the MARA Notice would not establish fraudulent conduct by the agent and that the evidence before the Tribunal was not sufficient to establish fraud.
