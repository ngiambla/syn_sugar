 That judgment in turn accepted and applied the reasoning in Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; (2006) 149 FCR 558; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 ; (2004) 141 FCR 448; and Gerhard v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 495. 21 Applying the principles set out in Zhou by the Full Court, his Honour held that the Tribunal did not commit a jurisdictional error by failing to find that s 116 of the Migration Act was relevantly limited. 22 The Federal Magistrate also found that jurisdictional error had not been established on the issue whether it was open to the Tribunal to find that the appellant had not complied with condition 8202.
 His Honour held that the breach had been established through evidence that was independent of the s 20 notice. 23 In considering whether the Tribunal had applied the correct test in determining whether the appellant had "not complied" with condition 8202 rather than whether he had "breached" the condition, the Federal Magistrate found that there was no difference in meaning that was of any relevant significance.
