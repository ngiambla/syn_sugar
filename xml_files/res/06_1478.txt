 The delegate's decision to this effect should be affirmed. " THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 17 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. 19 The Federal Magistrate reviewed the relevant legislation and found that the combined effect of s 116(3) and reg 2.43(2) was to remove any discretion and make visa cancellation mandatory in the case of a breach of any of the conditions referred to in reg 2.43(2). 20 In that regard his Honour referred to the Full Court of this Court's discussion of the effect of the provisions in Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 193 ; (2005) 88 ALD 90 (at [17]-[26]).
 That judgment in turn accepted and applied the reasoning in Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; (2006) 149 FCR 558; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 ; (2004) 141 FCR 448; and Gerhard v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 495. 21 Applying the principles set out in Zhou by the Full Court, his Honour held that the Tribunal did not commit a jurisdictional error by failing to find that s 116 of the Migration Act was relevantly limited. 22 The Federal Magistrate also found that jurisdictional error had not been established on the issue whether it was open to the Tribunal to find that the appellant had not complied with condition 8202.
 His Honour held that the breach had been established through evidence that was independent of the s 20 notice. 23 In considering whether the Tribunal had applied the correct test in determining whether the appellant had "not complied" with condition 8202 rather than whether he had "breached" the condition, the Federal Magistrate found that there was no difference in meaning that was of any relevant significance.
