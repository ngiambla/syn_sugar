 Although initially responding affirmatively to the Tribunal's invitation to attend the hearing, the appellant did not attend but wrote to the Tribunal explaining that he was unable to do so because he did not have enough money and was mentally depressed.
 The Tribunal correctly identified the Convention requirements but could not be satisfied, on the basis of the material placed before it by the appellant, that all or some of those requirements had been met. 10 Section 430(1)(b) of the Act, on which the appellant relied requires the Tribunal to set out 'the reasons' for its decision.
