 The information in question was that provided by the Institute which seemed to demonstrate that the appellant's attendance had been 62% for term 1 of 2004 and 22% for term 2 of 2004. 23 On 16 August 2005, the appellant's migration agent sent a submission to the Tribunal stating that the appellant disputed the Institute's record of attendance.
 However, she has also correctly submitted that the invalidity of a s 20 notice does not lead to the invalidity of a subsequent decision of a delegate of the Minister, or the Tribunal, to cancel a visa pursuant to s 116 of the Migration Act : see Humayun and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ; (2006) 152 FCR 115.
