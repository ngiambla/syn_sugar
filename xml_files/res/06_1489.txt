 When no further communication was received from the appellant or his migration agent over the ensuing 72 hours, the Tribunal proceeded to determine the review, pursuant to s 362B(1)(b) of the Migration Act , without taking any further action or allowing the appellant to appear before it. 21 On 30 November 2004, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate.
 The information in question was that provided by the Institute which seemed to demonstrate that the appellant's attendance had been 62% for term 1 of 2004 and 22% for term 2 of 2004. 23 On 16 August 2005, the appellant's migration agent sent a submission to the Tribunal stating that the appellant disputed the Institute's record of attendance.
 However, she has also correctly submitted that the invalidity of a s 20 notice does not lead to the invalidity of a subsequent decision of a delegate of the Minister, or the Tribunal, to cancel a visa pursuant to s 116 of the Migration Act : see Humayun and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 ; (2006) 152 FCR 115.
 Accordingly, for both of those reasons, the appellant's submission that the s 20 notice was defective and invalid is of no consequence in the present appeal. 43 In response to the appellant's contention that the Tribunal misconstrued and misapplied the operation of condition 8202, the Minister submitted that she was not obliged to consider any "exceptional circumstances".
