 Similarly an order rejecting an application for an extension of time to commence proceedings under the ADJR Act is an interlocutory order: Barrett v The Minister of State for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 18 ALD 129. ) 4 An appeal from an interlocutory judgment can only be brought if the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal: s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 Under O 52 r 10(1) Federal Court Rules , an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory order may be made orally to the judge who has pronounced the judgment at the time of its pronouncement. 5 After I delivered judgment this morning, the applicant, who was self-represented in Court, orally applied for leave to appeal against my decision to the Full Court of the Federal Court. 6 I invited submissions from the respondents in relation to this application.
 It is necessary to show that the order in respect of which leave to appeal is sought is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered, and that substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused: Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hydrocarbon Products Pty Ltd (1987) 72 ALR 391, Telstra Corporation Ltd v AAPT Ltd (1997) 38 IPR 539. 8 I am very conscious that there are concurrent criminal proceedings in the Magistrates Court at Brisbane in respect of the applicant.
