 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the decision given on 8 August 2006 by Barnes FM, who declined to make an order nisi on the basis that no arguable case had been established ( Applicant S117/2005 v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs Anor [2006] FMCA 1169).
 As I have indicated to him, the role of this Court is simply to correct errors in the approach of the Federal Magistrates Court, not to deal directly with the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 3 This matter has a long history, which I need not go into, but, as I have explained to the applicant, in the absence of his ability to raise an arguable ground of appeal from the learned Federal Magistrate's decision, I am bound to dismiss his application, which I do.
