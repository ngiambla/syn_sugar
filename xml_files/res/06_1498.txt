 As pointed out by the Full Court in Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 the discretion to make orders under s 56 must be exercised judicially, but that is the only relevant limitation (at 3).
 The matter is now so close to a hearing and so much time and costs have been expended that it would be a grave injustice to the applicants if they were ordered to provide security for costs when it is apparent that they cannot comply with such an order. ' (at 446) 5.
 While I note that the respondents had earlier sought and obtained an order for security for pre-trial costs, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why an application for security for trial costs has been brought on what is, in effect, the eve of the trial. 6.
 However, the fact that this case has already been characterised by significant delays is undesirable from the perspective of the parties and the Court, and there is an obvious risk that an order for security for costs which proves unrealistic for the applicants to comply with would delay the trial even further. 7.
