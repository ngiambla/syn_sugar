 There is a serious question to be tried that consumers when confronted with the respondents' store will have an impression of a Clark Rubber store. 22 The impression created upon a consumer looking at the front of the first respondent's store will be exacerbated by the fact that the first respondent is offering for sale and selling products similar to the lines of products sold by Clark Rubber stores.
 Further, any extra or additional costs incurred by the first respondent in changing the colour scheme and get up of the outside of the store can similarly be protected by the usual undertaking as to damages. 24 As against the damage to the first respondent, I consider that the balance of convenience is in favour of the grant of an injunction because of the potential impact and effect on the distinctiveness of the Clark Rubber colour scheme and the extent to which it identifies stores bearing that colour scheme as part of the Clark Rubber business.
