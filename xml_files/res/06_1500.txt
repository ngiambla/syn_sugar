 Formal Land Registry title searches have not been conducted. 15 However, I am satisfied, having regard to the affidavits of Glenn Archer, Karen Douglas and Tracy Laird that neither John Wolff nor Nancy Wolff continue to enjoy the interest which they held at the moment in time when they were joined as parties in the second Kuuku Ya'u claim and thus became parties to the consolidated claim.
 However, the interests affected must be genuine, greater than those of a member of the general public, not indirect, remote or lacking in substance, capable of clear definition and of such a character that they may be affected in a demonstrable way by a determination in relation to the Application ( Byron Environment Centre Inc. v Arakwal People at 51, ln 34 to 43, per Black CJ). 16 Having regard to the material filed in support of the Application, I am satisfied that neither John Wolff nor Nancy Wolff enjoys interests for the purposes of s 84(9)(b) that may be affected by a determination in these proceedings. 17 I am also satisfied that John Wolff and Nancy Wolff have received notice of the Application before the Court this morning, have not sought to appear or respond to the Notice of Motion and have not filed a Form 162 in response to the letter from the Tribunal of 30 August 2006.
 I am also satisfied that the election on the part of John Wolff and Nancy Wolff not to appear is consistent with evidence put before the Court by paragraph 17 of the affidavit of Glenn Archer to the effect that Mr Archer has read transcripts of prior listings of this matter before the Court and has noted that during the course of directions hearings in the matter neither John Wolff nor Nancy Wolff has appeared.
