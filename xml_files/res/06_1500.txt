 Formal Land Registry title searches have not been conducted. 15 However, I am satisfied, having regard to the affidavits of Glenn Archer, Karen Douglas and Tracy Laird that neither John Wolff nor Nancy Wolff continue to enjoy the interest which they held at the moment in time when they were joined as parties in the second Kuuku Ya'u claim and thus became parties to the consolidated claim.
 I am also satisfied that the election on the part of John Wolff and Nancy Wolff not to appear is consistent with evidence put before the Court by paragraph 17 of the affidavit of Glenn Archer to the effect that Mr Archer has read transcripts of prior listings of this matter before the Court and has noted that during the course of directions hearings in the matter neither John Wolff nor Nancy Wolff has appeared.
