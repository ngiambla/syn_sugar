 Interium was obliged to notify Ashlar of its intention to sell or dispose of the Prismex panel business over the ensuing 5 years. 14 In each of the assignment agreement and the sale of business agreement there were three recitals.
 Although postulating a legal proposition which Prismex Technologies did not seek to defend before me (that the licence terminated upon Interium going into liquidation 'in accordance with ordinary commercial practice'), the letter left the reader in no doubt but that Prismex Technologies, as grantor of the licence, regarded the licence as terminated upon the act of liquidation.
 On 7 March 1996, Taggert, on behalf of Interium, sent a facsimile to a company called Win Win International, in which he explained why it was not possible for Prismex products to be sold into Hong Kong.
