 The adviser attached a number of documents and press clippings which he said supported the arguments advanced. 2 The Tribunal invited the attendance of the appellants and the English language transcript of the proceedings was in evidence before the learned Federal Magistrate and is before the Court on this appeal.
 On the basis of that information, the Tribunal rejected the claims of well-founded fear of persecution because of ethnicity and religion. 5 The essence of the application for relief pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), which was made to the Federal Magistrates Court, was that the Tribunal member had not considered the case put forward on behalf of the appellants.
 In essence, the learned Federal Magistrate, apart from not being persuaded of that, held that the real basis for the Tribunal's decision in any event was the material current at the time of the Tribunal's decision in 1995, which effectively superseded that which went before ( SZGLQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FMCA 670).
