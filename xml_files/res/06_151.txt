 On 15 June 2005 he signed a statement in connection with that proceeding to which were annexed a number of documents, being copies of communications which passed between McCarthy and officers of APRA prior to the disqualification.
 The motion was later amended to include alternative relief that he have leave to use the particular exhibits concerned in the AAT proceeding or that he have leave to the extent required to seek production from APRA of APRA's copies of those documents for use in the AAT proceedings.
 I am also satisfied that the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of the copies of the documents would have been known to Stephenson and the solicitors acting for him in the AAT proceedings, whether or not all of the implications were understood.
 It would be unfortunate if material which would have come to light in that way were precluded from use by reason of the documents having come to the attention of the solicitors for Stephenson by virtue of the apparent breach of the implied undertaking. 10 I am therefore disposed to make an order along the lines of Order 2 in the amended notice of motion.
