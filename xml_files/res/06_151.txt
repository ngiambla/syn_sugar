 I stood over the motion in order to give further consideration to the wider issues involved ( Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Rural General Insurance Limited (ACN 000 007 492) (Subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) [2005] FCA 1548). 2 In 2003 and 2004, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) was proceeding in this Court seeking to wind up Rural General Insurance Limited (as it then was) (Rural General) pursuant to s 462(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
 The motion was later amended to include alternative relief that he have leave to use the particular exhibits concerned in the AAT proceeding or that he have leave to the extent required to seek production from APRA of APRA's copies of those documents for use in the AAT proceedings.
 I was satisfied that it had been sufficiently deployed in public to justify its use in the proceedings under all of the circumstances. 5 The evidence is that the other documents were received by the solicitors currently acting for Stephenson from the solicitors who acted for Rural General in the winding up proceeding.
