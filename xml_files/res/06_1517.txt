 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 16 August 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 7 March 2001 and handed down on 29 March 2001.
 As the appellant had not claimed to be a leader, or be employed by the government, or to be a member of the Communist party, the Tribunal found on the basis of the country information that it appeared the appellant would not be adversely targeted by the Chinese authorities. 5 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant claimed there was jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision and denial of procedural fairness.
 In VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 , Sundberg and Hely JJ stated, at [16]: Part 7 of the Act (in which ss 420 , 425A , 426A , 441A and 441C appear) must be read as a whole.
