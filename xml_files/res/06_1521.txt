 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant. 2 The appellant is a citizen of Tonga.
 In an amended application filed on 28 September 2004, the appellant relied on certain constitutional grounds and filed a Notice of a Constitutional Matter under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
 The Federal Magistrate held that the constitutional validity of ss 474, 475, and s 476 of the Act could not be affected by other Commonwealth enactments even if there were inconsistencies between them.
