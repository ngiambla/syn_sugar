 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant. 2 The appellant is a citizen of Tonga.
 In an amended application filed on 28 September 2004, the appellant relied on certain constitutional grounds and filed a Notice of a Constitutional Matter under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
 The appellant claimed that ss 474 , 475 and 476 of the Migration Act were unconstitutional. 5 The Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, found that s 474 of the Act was a valid enactment and referred to Plaintiff S157 of 2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476.
 The Federal Magistrate held that the constitutional validity of ss 474, 475, and s 476 of the Act could not be affected by other Commonwealth enactments even if there were inconsistencies between them.
