 The Tribunal was satisfied that any previous involvement with Falun Gong would not make the appellant a person of concern to Chinese authorities, unless he continued actively to participate in Falun Gong or participate in protest activities against the government.
 The Tribunal was under no obligation to send notices to the appellant's residential address, as he had indicated that all correspondence was to be sent to his migration agent.
 The Tribunal did not have to disclose all independent country information to the appellant, as it came within the exception provided for in s 424A(3)(a) of the Act. 7 The notice of appeal to this Court raises two grounds.
