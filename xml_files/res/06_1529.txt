 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 24 August 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 29 March 2006 and handed down on 18 April 2006.
 His Honour considered this to be an application for an adjournment but found there were no grounds to support such a request as the appellant had three months to prepare and had been offered legal advice by an experienced barrister.
 GROUNDS OF APPEAL 6 The notice of appeal and affidavit filed on 1 September 2006 raised the following grounds: that the Federal Magistrate did not find the Tribunal committed legal error; that the Federal Magistrate denied the rules of natural justice; and that the appellant's statement of claim was not given any weight. 7 At the hearing of the appeal before me the appellant provided a written submission dated 3 November 2006.
 I asked the applicant about that, and he indicated that he had nothing to do with Pakistan. 11 Whilst this conclusion seems correct and would have disposed of the confusion, the appellant nevertheless before me submitted in his written submissions: That the appellant wanted his friend that he should write that in the Khalistan movement or the related any movement there were Hindu Drug Lords who used to sell the arms and, other material to the people who wanted the independent state of Punjab, the selling of the arms was misinterpreted by my friend.
