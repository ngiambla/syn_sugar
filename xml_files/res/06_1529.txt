 The appellant claimed that he was arrested by the police and detained for one month, that his house was attacked in 2002, and that his brother was injured and subsequently died. 3 On 28 March 2006 the Tribunal received a response to a hearing invitation indicating the appellant did not want to attend the scheduled Tribunal hearing.
 The Federal Magistrate found no reviewable error as the decision was based on a lack of information and thus the Tribunal was not satisfied the information was sufficient to enable it to grant a protection visa.
 GROUNDS OF APPEAL 6 The notice of appeal and affidavit filed on 1 September 2006 raised the following grounds: that the Federal Magistrate did not find the Tribunal committed legal error; that the Federal Magistrate denied the rules of natural justice; and that the appellant's statement of claim was not given any weight. 7 At the hearing of the appeal before me the appellant provided a written submission dated 3 November 2006.
