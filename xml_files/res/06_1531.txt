 It followed that the profit figures for each of the Carousel and Morley stores were false in that the turnover figures on which those profit figures were based were false. 63 Further the applicant pleaded that the departmental trading statements were also misleading or deceptive in a different respect, which is related to the rent representation.
 I do not accept the submission by counsel for the respondents that the fact that Mr Stubberfield on 4 October 2001 asked Mr Sadler whether the profit of $400 000 would hold up undermined Mr Stubberfield's evidence as to the terms of the conversation on 25 September 2001 with Mr Sadler.
 I also find that Mr Sadler was knowingly concerned in that contravention, because he was aware of the turnover figures for July and August, and that the September and October figures provided did not accurately reflect the true trading performance of the business for the current year, being the 2002 year to date.
