 The complainant resists the trustee's claim for costs on any basis and submits that the trustee should pay his costs. 3 As to the first aspect of the trustee's claim for costs, the complainant's main point is that the trustee in effect ran six grounds of appeal against the Tribunal's determinations, and succeeded on only two of them.
 Taking into account the weight of the written submissions and other material filed, and the time spent during the hearing on the various points, I think that justice would be served if I ordered the complainant to pay two-thirds of the trustee's costs of the proceeding. 8 The second aspect of the trustee's claim for costs is based upon a letter which its solicitors sent to the complainant's solicitors on 28 October 2005.
