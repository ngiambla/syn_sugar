 1 The applicant (the Commission) seeks the following orders against the second respondent (Mr Rae): 1. a declaration; 2. an order that the undertakings referred to in order 1 of the Orders of this Court made on 21 March 2001 cease and Mr Rae's passport be returned to him; and 3. an order that Mr Rae pay the Commission's costs of these proceedings in the amount of $12 165. 2 Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the Commission and Mr Rae have filed a minute of proposed consent orders dated 18 October 2006, setting out the orders that the Commission and Mr Rae propose in order to resolve these proceedings (Minute of Consent Orders).
 Mr Rae admits all the matters alleged in the further amended statement of claim. 7 The Commission recognises that, notwithstanding the agreement reached between the parties as to the terms of the proposed consent orders, it is for the Court to determine whether or not it has the power to make the orders proposed, and whether, in all the circumstances it is appropriate to do so. 8 The Court must not exceed its power in the making of consent orders.
 The parties cannot by consent confer power to the Court to make orders which the Court lacks the power to make: Thomson Australia Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1981) 148 CLR 150 at 165 and followed by French J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [19] ( ACCC v REIWA ). 9 In considering proposed consent orders the Court should not impede settlements between parties legally represented and able to understand and evaluate the desirability of agreeing to that settlement.
 In the present proceedings the declaration sought is directed to the determination of a legal controversy and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions by reason that, firstly, in its further amended statement of claim, the Commission identifies and particularises the alleged representations and conduct giving rise to liability under the TPA and asserts that by those representations and conduct, Info4PC has contravened the TPA and Mr Rae has been directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or party to those contraventions.
