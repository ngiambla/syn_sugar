 The applicant's claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution for the Convention reason of political opinion arose out of his imputed claimed association with the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) (Maoist).
 However the appellant accepted (in argument, although not in his written submissions) that the error would only be relevant if there were a finding of a well-founded fear of persecution.
 At hearing the applicant maintained the claim that if he returns to Nepal the Maoists would continue to visit his home and make demands, and that they might shoot him (see page 9 above).
