 CONSIDERATION 14 For the reasons that follow, I would order that Mr Spalla pay Mr Rambaldi's and the Deloitte parties' costs of the first four days of the trial on an indemnity basis and, thereafter, on a party and party basis.
 Mr Spalla should also pay the respondents' costs of his bias application on a party and party basis. 15 The power of the Court to make an order for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 Costs ordinarily follow the event (that is, the successful party receives costs) and are awarded on a party and party basis, unless there are particular or special circumstances that warrant the Court departing from this practice and making some other order: see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 (" Colgate-Palmolive ") at 232-233 per Sheppard J and Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J. 16 The rationale for an indemnity costs order can be variously stated.
