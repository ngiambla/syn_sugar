 Deloitte parties 10 The Deloitte parties submitted that Mr Spalla should pay their costs of, and incidental to, the first four days of the trial on an indemnity basis and, thereafter, on a party and party basis.
 CONSIDERATION 14 For the reasons that follow, I would order that Mr Spalla pay Mr Rambaldi's and the Deloitte parties' costs of the first four days of the trial on an indemnity basis and, thereafter, on a party and party basis.
 I consider it unlikely that Mr Spalla pressed on with the hearing with an appropriate appreciation that his application was likely to fail and that the occasion for the consideration of Mr Rambaldi's application for indemnity costs was likely to arise.
 Thereafter, as I have said, Mr Spalla represented himself at the trial. 31 Mr Spalla's conduct of the litigation over the first four days of the hearing was unreasonable and led to a needless waste of hearing time.
