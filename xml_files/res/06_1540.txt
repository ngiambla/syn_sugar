 The respondent defended its efforts in meeting the argument by reference to the significant consequences for the respondent and the superannuation industry generally if the appellants' argument that dependency in a superannuation trust deed included emotional dependency.
 A significant amount of preparation time had therefore been required to understand the factual material so as to enable it to be able to properly address the distinction between Wednesbury unreasonableness and mere questions of weight.
 The respondent had failed on the issue of whether, as a matter of construction, it was necessary to determine whether the word "Dependant" and notions of dependency in the trust deed, concerned only financial dependency. 4 In relation to the shifting articulation point raised by the respondent, the appellants submitted that they had always asserted, and maintained throughout the hearing and in the amended notice of appeal, the primary contention that the Tribunal erred by narrowly focusing on financial dependence in ascertaining whether the appellants were in any way dependent on the deceased.
