 The matter has been comprehensively dealt with in the written submissions of Ms Wong, counsel for the respondent Minister, and I will append those submissions to these reasons rather than simply paraphrase them. 2 Long and varied experience of hearing legally hopeless applications for judicial review of Tribunal decisions, and of appeals from the Federal Magistrates Court when that court has declined to grant judicial review, has left me with no small reservoir of cynicism about the extent to which there are quite worthless and simply manipulatory approaches to the courts, and indeed to the Tribunal, by persons who in reality are a long way from being refugees of any kind, except from the relative poverty of their own countries as compared to Australia.
 The establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court, and improved management and procedures and, perhaps, more generous provision of personnel in the Tribunal have meant that the entire legal process, which certainly is capable of abuse, nevertheless now displays only rarely the kinds of egregious delays which probably led to the great expansion of legally worthless and merely cynical claims for refugee status being made, and to applications for judicial review of their rejection by the competent authorities.
