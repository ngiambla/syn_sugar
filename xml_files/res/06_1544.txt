 1 This is an appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Scarlett on 22 March 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('The Tribunal') which was handed down on 20 October 2005.
 The Tribunal made its decision on 13 October 2005, and handed it down on 20 October 2005, affirming the decision not to grant a protection visa. ' 3 The appellant's claims for a Protection Visa assert a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of political opinion.
 The [appellant] is free to continue his support for the AL if he returns to Bangladesh, and faces no more than a remote and insubstantial possibility --- hence, no real chance --- of persecutory or other harm should [he] wish to pursue his political interests.
 However, the Tribunal also had information that I arrived in Australia on 1 October 2001, applied for a protection visa on 30 October 2001, and the Tribunal made that phone call to ODPUP on 2 August 2005, some three years ten months and one day after my arrival in Australia.
 The fact of that employment brought into serious question the claimed fear of persecution for political opinion. 30 The appellant, in his written submissions, referred to Waco v Minister Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511 (' Waco ').
