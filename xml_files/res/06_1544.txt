 1 This is an appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Scarlett on 22 March 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('The Tribunal') which was handed down on 20 October 2005.
 The significance of the conversation, from the Tribunal's point of view, appears to be that it indicates that the appellant had been employed by ODPUP, as he had claimed in his application for a visa, and which he later denied.
 The fact of that employment brought into serious question the claimed fear of persecution for political opinion. 30 The appellant, in his written submissions, referred to Waco v Minister Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511 (' Waco ').
