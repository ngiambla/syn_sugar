 The test as to whether leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision should be granted is that enumerated in the Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397: first, whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by an appeal court; and secondly whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision were to be wrong.
 The appellant contended in the FMC that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in relying upon historical country information, rather than up to date information, in relation to the discrimination against and persecution of Chinese in Malaysia.
