 The test as to whether leave to appeal from an interlocutory decision should be granted is that enumerated in the Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397: first, whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by an appeal court; and secondly whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision were to be wrong.
 The appellant contended in the FMC that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in relying upon historical country information, rather than up to date information, in relation to the discrimination against and persecution of Chinese in Malaysia.
 Allsop J at par 11 said that the Tribunal's reasons in that case ' were related to the insufficiency of the material placed before it by the appellant and its express state of lack of satisfaction '.
 That case involved the same factual circumstances as apply here. 7 The Federal Magistrate was right to conclude that there was no arguable case for the relief which the applicant claimed. 8 The application for leave is refused with costs. 9 I will amend the name of the respondent to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
