 1 In these proceedings, SZIHH v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs , when the matter was called on the appellant did not appear. 2 I note that the appellant on 26 September 2005 lodged an application with the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the RRT') who invited him to appear at a hearing on 30 November 2005.
 Further, I am told that the Australian Government Solicitor wrote to the appellant on 26 September and 31 October 2006 and I am told that neither of those letters was returned unclaimed. 5 Having regard to the history of the matter and in particular the appellant's non-appearance on several occasions, this is a clear case where the appellant is not pursuing his appeal, and the appeal will be dismissed.
