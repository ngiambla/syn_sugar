 1 In these proceedings, SZIHH v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs , when the matter was called on the appellant did not appear. 2 I note that the appellant on 26 September 2005 lodged an application with the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the RRT') who invited him to appear at a hearing on 30 November 2005.
 The RRT then proceeded to review the matter without a hearing, pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') and concluded that it was not able to reach the required level of satisfaction in relation to the applicant's claims as they were scant and lacking in detail. 3 Before the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant claimed as his only ground that he was denied an opportunity to present his case at the hearing as the RRT sent all the correspondence to the applicant's previous address, after the applicant had notified the Tribunal of his change of address.
 Further, I am told that the Australian Government Solicitor wrote to the appellant on 26 September and 31 October 2006 and I am told that neither of those letters was returned unclaimed. 5 Having regard to the history of the matter and in particular the appellant's non-appearance on several occasions, this is a clear case where the appellant is not pursuing his appeal, and the appeal will be dismissed.
