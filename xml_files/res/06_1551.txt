 She said that she was not satisfied that the alleged accord and satisfaction and claim for goods sold and delivered, and the actions relating thereto, provide a basis for dismissing the petition. 24 The Registrar considered the evidence as to the appellant's ability to pay her debts (s 52(2)(a) of the Act).
 The appellant submitted that she did not have to show that the application and proposed appeal would succeed but that it was sufficient that she establish a real and arguable case that the application and proposed appeal would succeed.
 The Federal Magistrate said that there was insufficient evidence that the creditor's petition was brought for an improper or collateral purpose. 42 On the question of whether the appellant was able to pay her debts, the Federal Magistrate said that the appellant had provided no evidence about her assets or liabilities.
