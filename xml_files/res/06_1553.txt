 What is clear is that neither Regis Towers nor the bankrupt had the financial capacity, independently of the assistance provided by Kerrie McInnes, to enter into an agreement with Meriton Apartments Pty Limited on 20 April 1999 in the terms of the Head Agreement. 161 It follows that the bankrupt did not relevantly do something which resulted in Regis Towers becoming the owner of the Head Agreement choses in action that did not previously exist.
 It is unnecessary to undertake a valuation of such consideration, but prima facie it would be unlikely that its value would be less than $275,814.51. 225 As for the payment of $334,439.88 by the bankrupt to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited, $75,114.15 represented monies paid to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative' in respect of the settlement of the purchases by Regis Towers of Lots 488 and 489 in Strata Plan No 61369.
 The relevant consideration would be an implied promise by Meriton Apartments Pty Limited to release Regis Towers from its obligation under the Head Agreement of 20 April 1999 to itself pay the relevant amount to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited and an implied promise by Meriton Property Management Pty Limited to release Regis Towers from its obligation under the three agreements for purchase of Lots 488, 489 and 650 to itself pay the relevant amounts to Meriton Apartments Pty Limited as Meriton Property Management Pty Limited's 'vendor's representative'.
