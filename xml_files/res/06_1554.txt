 The reasons for this conclusion of no breach of the requirements of s 424A is anchored in the opinion of the Court that while the claim in the Protection Visa to having been detained for 12 days provided a starting point for questioning the appellant at the Tribunal hearing, the claim of detention for 12 days in the Protection Visa application was not a reason for affirming the decision under review.
 The Court concluded that the evaluation by the Tribunal of the appellant's testimony was not 'information' which was required to be disclosed under s 424A(1) of the Act. 8 In relation to the ground in her appeal which asserts that the Tribunal was in breach of s 91R of Act, there does not appear, in my judgment, to be any misconstruction of s 91R of the Act by the Tribunal, and there is no basis for the Court to interfere with the Tribunal's factual finding as to the harm the appellant claims to have suffered.
 That such information does not come within s 424A(1) has been reaffirmed in SZEEU v Minister of Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [223] to [224] and again in SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238 at [12] . ' 19 In SZEEU , Moore J at pars 18 and 19 was concerned with what constitutes 'information' for the purpose of s 424A.
