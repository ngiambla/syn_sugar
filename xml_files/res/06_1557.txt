 The Tribunal does not accept that the Applicant was under scrutiny from the Chinese authorities by reason of an association with Falun Gong and faces arrest on his return to China.
 The Tribunal was unconvinced by the Applicant's oral evidence that he is a Falun Gong practitioner and that he was detained in October 2000 as a result of partaking in a protest.
