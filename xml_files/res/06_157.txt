 My attention has been drawn to the fact that I did not explicitly deal with the form of order for compensation to be made in respect of Loncaric and Carlon Pty Limited insofar as there was a claim for contingent loss. 2 Loncaric negotiated the appointment of two sub-distributors by Carlon Pty Limited by passing on to those potential sub-distributors the misrepresentations made to him by the relevant respondents.
 The gist of the deed is that sub-distributors would refrain from suing and would release Carlon Pty Limited from liability on the basis that Carlon Pty Limited would include the claim from the sub-distributors in the claim made against the respondents. 3 I am satisfied that the terms of s 87 are wide enough to authorise the inclusion of orders which have the effect of indemnifying Carlon Pty Limited from claims by the sub-distributors.
