 Under s 426A , the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable an applicant to appear before it, if it has invited that person to appear before it and she or he fails to do so.
 The Tribunal was not satisfied the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution in China and refused to grant a protection visa. 4 On 25 January 2005, the applicant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court for an order that the respondents show cause why a remedy should not be granted under s 476 of the Act regarding the decision of the Tribunal.
 Federal Magistrate Smith found the particulars which sought to assert the Tribunal failed to comply with ss 425, 425A and 424A(1) of the Act did not support the grounds relied on: the Tribunal invited the applicant to a hearing in compliance with the relevant sections and the Tribunal's reasons for its decision were not based on 'information' but, rather, its inability to be satisfied by the evidence. 5 The applicant asserted he was 'cheated' by his migration agent.
