 In any event, each of them seeks to traverse matters of merit or take issue in an unparticularised way with the ultimate question of fact for the Tribunal, that is, does the appellant have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. 6 The only issue of substance which the appellant raises on appeal is that contained in the first appeal ground.
 The appellant contends that the Tribunal did not give him a reasonable opportunity to respond to independent evidence in its possession which supported the view that the appellant could return to Bangladesh without fear of persecution. 7 As the Tribunal's decision pre-dated the enactment of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), it is open to the appellant to submit that he was denied natural justice by not being given an opportunity to respond to the country information relied on by the Tribunal to reject his claim. 8 The Federal Magistrate dealt with and rejected the appellant's claim alleging a denial of procedural fairness.
 There is no suggestion in the decision that the Tribunal put specific independent evidence to the appellant as material which specifically contradicted his claims. 14 The Federal Magistrate noted the appellant did not provide him with a copy of the transcript to make out his claim that the Tribunal did not raise the independent evidence with him.
