 The Tribunal found that the applicant had fabricated her claims in order to advance her protection visa application; in particular, that photographs of her practising Falun Gong at Darling Harbour were made in order to assist in the success of that application.
 In that application, she claimed that the Tribunal had breached s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") and that the Tribunal had not assessed properly her chance of persecution if she were returned to China.
 In addition, the Federal Magistrate held that her show cause application did not raise a serious question to be tried and that she had failed before the Tribunal simply because her claims were completely disbelieved.
