 The Tribunal was not satisfied on the information before it that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner and that she suffered persecution for her Falun Gong activities, nor that she left China for that reason.
 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant could not or would not return to China because of fear of persecution due to Falun Gong activities in either China or Australia.
