 The Tribunal had rejected her application for a protection visa. 2 The applicant filed her application for an extension of time on 14 July 2006, almost three years after the decision of the Tribunal was made.
 In the affidavit attached to the application, the applicant stated that her migration agent did not notify her of the decision and that she had only received a copy of the judgment on 10 July 2006.
 The applicant also stated in the affidavit that the migration agent did not properly handle her request for a business visa rather than a protection visa. 3 In oral evidence given at the hearing the applicant confirmed that at all relevant times it was her wish to obtain a business visa.
