 The appellant claimed that he then paid a large sum of money to obtain a passport, and, with the assistance of a friend, he obtained his visa. 3 The Tribunal found that the appellant's knowledge of facts relating to Falun Gong was incommensurate with his claim that he was a long-standing Falun Gong practitioner.
 His Honour held that the Tribunal did not rely on any information provided by the appellant because the decision was based upon its dissatisfaction with the appellant's answers to its questions.
 The Tribunal did not make its decision based on assumption but based its conclusions as to the appellant's lack of knowledge of facts pertaining to Falun Gong.
 The Federal Magistrate was unable to discern any other error after a thorough reading of the decision. 6 The notice of appeal to this Court raised the following grounds: (a) the Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty and did not consider the appellant's application according to sections 424A and 91R of the Act; (b) the Tribunal was biased against the appellant; and (c) the Federal Magistrates' Court failed to make the "right judgment" because it had fallen into the above mentioned jurisdictional errors.
