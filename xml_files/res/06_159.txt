 Although it is a case, in effect, of winding up by inadvertence and although it is very promptly brought and although no external creditor appeared, the authorities are quite clear that caution needs to be exercised before a winding up is stayed or terminated lest an insolvent company is returned to commerce.
 So, even though this is a matter in which the insolvency was purely based upon a non-compliance with the statutory demand which was not in fact received, it is my duty to ensure that I do not, so far as I can, permit an insolvent company to return to trading. 4 I will not deal with the fine detail of the evidence which relates to the question of solvency.
 I say that because it is clear enough that, although it is contended that there is an excess of current assets over current liabilities and although it is said that current trading will be profitable, the overall position is that liabilities exceed assets if account is taken of all liabilities, including liabilities which are described as subordinated.
 In my opinion, a company in which the assets are exceeded by liabilities is not solvent, although it may be able to continue trading because it has excess liquidity for the time being. 5 With that in mind, the matter was adjourned to enable consideration to be given to a cure for that.
