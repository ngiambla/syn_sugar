 Mr Gilberg's Claim for a Benefit 32 There is no issue in this case that Rule 17(a) was satisfied --- namely that Mr Gilberg's employment was terminated solely on the grounds that he was permanently incapable of performing his duties. 33 It is accepted that Rule 17(b) also was satisfied.
 It is clear that the Tribunal, in rejecting Dr Oates' opinion, did not do so solely by reference to the contents of his report but, rather, by reference to, and preference for, the opinions of only some of the other medical practitioners. 69 On the basis of its own assessment of the medical evidence the Tribunal set the decision of the Trustee aside and substituted a decision that Mr Gilberg was totally and permanently disabled and entitled to a TPD benefit. 70 In my view this approach to the medical issues was misconceived.
 For the purposes of s 37(5) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Complaints Act "), Rule 17(d) did not require the Tribunal in determining whether the decision was fair or reasonable for the purposes of ss 14(2) and 37 of the Complaints Act , or in determining relief under s 37(3) and 37 (4) of the Complaints Act , to disregard a report obtained under Rule 17(b) or Rule 17(c) where the subject of the medical opinion in the report was not the subject of a medical opinion provided by an additional medical practitioner under Rule 17(d) ; 3 .
