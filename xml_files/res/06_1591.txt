 In particular, Mr Arenson drew Mr Corrick's attention to the reproduction on the DMC article of the claim, 'The shape of this inflated product is a Registered Design' . (h) On 27 September 2006, the solicitors for DMC applied to register a design of a surfcraft in the name of DMC and, in that Application, Mr Corrick was described as the designer.
 Mr Corrick says this: (a) Approximately 18 months ago, Mr Binkin approached him in relation to a proposal to use DMC's relationship with the NRL to obtain licences to apply the logos of the NRL football teams to an inflatable surf mat. (b) Mr Corrick says, 'I was already aware of inflatable surf craft prior to that approach' . (c) At no time did Mr Binkin disclose to him that Mr Binkin had any relationship or possible relationship with Midamarine.
 Mr Corrick says, 'I also mentioned the surf mat at that stage, but the NRL was not interested' . (g) Mr Corrick says that, 'In any event, I was not interested as the pricing proposed by Mr Binkin was prohibitive, it included the cost of the surf mat, a 15% royalty payment to the licensor and the store's margin.
 Mr Binkin did not leave with me any drawings or graphic representations of his proposal for the use of team logos on a surf mat' . 20 In those responsive paragraphs of Mr Corrick's affidavit, Mr Corrick makes reference to drawings or graphic representations only for the purpose of denying that he was left with any such material.
