 Section 351 of the Act gives the Minister the same power in relation to decisions of the Migration Review Tribunal under Pt 5 of the Act. " To the same effect is another Full Court's decision in M38 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 131 ; (2003) 199 ALR 290 at [80] .
 See also Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VFAY [2003] FCAFC 191 at [6] --- the discretion may be exercised on "compassionate or humanitarian grounds". 18 In SAAK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 4) one question was whether for the purposes of s 198(6) of the Act the exercise of the discretionary power in s 417(1) is a review of an application for a substantive visa.
 The basis of his Honour's decision lies in the existence of two sets of provisions: those in Part 5 of Division 3 (where s 351 appears) dealing with the review of decisions of the Migration Review Tribunal and those in Division 2 of Part 7 (where s 417 appears) dealing with review of protection visa decisions.
