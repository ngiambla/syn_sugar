 Particulars The Claimant is entitled to the difference between the Contract price of $395.00 per tonne and the market price of the Wheat at 30 August 2003. ' 26 AWBA did not suggest that AWB Limited was not authorised to act on its behalf in respect of dealings with Bective Station concerning the Second Contract.
 On 27 October 2003 it issued an invoice to Bective Station claiming payment of a ' washout amount ' of $1 368 500; that is, the amount which its letter of 20 October 2003 advised would be the cost of a 'washout' based on the October price for wheat.
 If you don't order promptly wheat will be unprocurable at the price we are now offering, and there'll be no wheat available from March onwards. "' 57 Mr Vickery's diary for 31 October 2002 contains the following note: 'Rang AWB - $375 tonne March + $3.50' 'Pet Food Gunnedah 10,000 tonnes Gunnee 6,000 " Moses 5,000 " Killara Gunnee 5,000 " ' 58 Mr Adams' affidavit evidence was that he spoke to Mr Vickery by telephone on 30 October 2002 and advised him that Bective Station needed to start drawing down wheat under its first contract to purchase wheat from AWBA.
 However, notwithstanding Mr Vickery's jaundiced view of 'AWB', I accept his evidence that he caused Bective Station to enter into the Second Contract because of a concern that, if he did not, Bective Station may have been unable, after March 2003, to obtain the wheat which it would require to operate its feedlot.
