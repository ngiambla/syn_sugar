 The Tribunal also did not place weight on other documents and correspondence submitted by the appellant due to inconsistencies between those documents and the oral evidence given by the appellant at the hearing. 5 The Tribunal found that neither the appellant nor his family were actively involved in the Sikh Khalistan movement or were at risk of persecution for their actual or perceived political role.
 In this sense, the Tribunal's view that the documents were fabricated to assist the applicant's claims was not the basis for its decision. 12 Her Honour acknowledged that the Tribunal made adverse credibility findings against the appellant, however noted that these findings were made independently of the documents he later provided.
 The Federal Magistrate erred by 'endorsing the Tribunal errors'; specifically that her Honour erred by failing to pronounce judgment in favour of the appellant despite finding that the Tribunal had erred with regard to the inconsistencies in evidence it had relied upon. 3.
