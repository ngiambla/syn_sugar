 Indeed, as I put to Dr Jureidini (but he declined to answer), the applicant's contention might give rise to the circumstance, as his mental condition is produced in large measure by his concern about being removed from Australia to Turkey, that he will never be in a condition where he can be safely removed from Australia.
 That itself introduces a somewhat difficult perspective in the present matter because, unlike other cases in which the health of the person being removed has been considered, the damage to the health of this applicant by the process of removal is related to his fears of what may happen to him if he were to return to Turkey.
 Consistently with the cases to which I have referred, therefore, in my view, there is a serious question to be tried that the proposed removal at present would be contrary to s 198 and should be restrained. 10 As I have said that is not to indicate a firm view about the meaning of s 198 or a firm view about its application to the circumstances of this applicant.
