 In looking at this question I will assume for the time being, though it is a matter in dispute, that the mark was capable of being distinctive of Colorado Group's goods and services.
 The view I take is that a reasonable Registrar would likely think that Mr Williams was providing him with information about the situation in 1991 and not as things stood in 2001.
 We went and looked at a lot of other trade mark registrations to try and, you know, sort of put a ring fence around Colorado and try and get more registrations.
