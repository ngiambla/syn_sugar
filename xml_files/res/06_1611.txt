 However, I consider that the evidence as to veering, manoeuvring and similar dangers on which the plaintiffs relied was thoroughly canvassed in the hearing, and I accepted the submissions of the plaintiffs on this point as to the nature and extent of these problems.
 In my view, although open to some criticism in the circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded that the conduct of the defendants in respect of the documents is sufficient to displace the general rule that costs should be paid by plaintiffs where an Offer of Compromise such as that in the present case has been made.
 It is said that this expression is undefined and subjective, and that if it were enforced, it would result in oppression to the plaintiffs because it would expose the plaintiffs to the unilateral requirements of the defendants and may allow unreasonable requirements, including indemnity obligations, to be imposed by the defendants. 12 It is correct that no deed of release was proffered by the defendants with the Offer of Compromise.
 Although each case must turn on its factual context, in my opinion, the Court can and will give content to the expression "satisfactory deed of release" as expressed in the Offer of Compromise in the present case. 14 Having regard to the evidence, it is my view that the insertion of this requirement played no significant part in the rejection of the Offer of Compromise because there was no reference to it in the challenges to the terms of the Offer made by the plaintiffs'solicitors.
