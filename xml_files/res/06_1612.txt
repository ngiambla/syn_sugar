 Reference was made to the judgment of the Full Court in Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 148 ALR 578 at 585. 3 In any event, this Court has what should probably be described as an implied statutory power to set aside an order made in the absence of a party where that absence was due to no fault of the party.
 The 84 days expired on 23 February 2006 . 6 Accordingly, the application to the Federal Magistrates Court filed on 13 April 2006 was out of time and that Court had no jurisdiction to entertain it.
