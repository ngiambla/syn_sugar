 The Federal Magistrate considered s 424A(1) of the Act had no application to the information impugned by the appellant --- information in the appellant's passport --- as it was information provided by the appellant.
 There is no error in the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that the appellant's passport information (being information provided by the appellant to the Tribunal) fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.
