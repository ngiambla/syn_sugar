 The Federal Magistrate considered s 424A(1) of the Act had no application to the information impugned by the appellant --- information in the appellant's passport --- as it was information provided by the appellant.
 The Tribunal concluded that I am not a Christian without evidence or materials to support it. 8 Further, in the appellant's affidavit of 28 August 2006 in support of the notice of appeal, it was stated: 1.
 It appears that the appellant is alleging, consistent with the only ground advanced before the Federal Magistrate, that the Tribunal breached s 424A of the Act when deciding his application. 12 It is clear that the Tribunal considered and rejected the appellant's claims.
 There is no error in the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that the appellant's passport information (being information provided by the appellant to the Tribunal) fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.
