 It was apparently received by the appellant as he lodged an application for review by the Tribunal on 6 September 2005. 4 The application for review in the Tribunal nominated the same address as the appellant's residential address and a different mailing address as his address for service and correspondence.
 The appellant did not appoint a migration agent in his application to the Tribunal. 5 On 19 September 2005 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant, not to the mailing address he had specified on his application but to his residential address, informing him of the receipt of his application for review. 6 On 11 October 2005 the Tribunal sent a letter to the mailing address specified on the application for review, stating that the Tribunal had considered the material before it in relation to the application but was unable to make a decision in his favour on this information alone and the Tribunal invited the appellant to attend at a hearing on 7 November 2005.
 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant complained that he had provided his telephone number to his migration agent however that person did not provide the details in his application to the Tribunal. 9 The Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, found that the Tribunal's decision was unaffected by jurisdictional error and was a privative clause decision.
 Therefore, it is clear that s 424A(1) was not enlivened at the time it invited the appellant to the hearing and the Tribunal was not required to give the appellant notice pursuant to that section. 17 In exercising its discretion under s 426A of the Act, the Tribunal clearly considered all of the circumstances relating to the invitation to appear at the hearing and the appellant's failure to attend.
