 The appellant had sought to appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 8 February 2006 dismissing a challenge to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 2 Greenwood J was exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court.
 There is no jurisdiction in this Court to entertain a purported appeal in the Court's appellate jurisdiction from a judgment of the type given by Greenwood J: see s 24(1AAA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 Accordingly, the process filed on 29 August 2006 does not engage the Court's appellate jurisdiction and does not otherwise engage the Court's jurisdiction save to the extent that I have jurisdiction to determine whether the Court has jurisdiction.
