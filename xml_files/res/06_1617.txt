 Clavey Legal wrote to the solicitors for QBE on 1 September 2006 referring to a telephone conversation held on that day and confirming their request for a copy of the Perpetual Loan Agreement and the statutory declaration provided to QBE with the call on the Bonds.
 Their position was that the "bonding facility" entered into between QBE and Westpoint Corporation was to have been issued on the strict basis "... that only the financee (sic) could have the benefit of any call made pursuant to a Bond issued by QBE".
 Given that they form the basis of the QBE claim against Westpoint Realty, they would not appear to attract either privilege or commercial confidentiality. 26 Mr McMaster referred to discussions about whether KordaMentha or Corrs had a conflict of interest in considering the QBE claim.
