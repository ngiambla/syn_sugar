 1 This is a notice of motion of 14 November 2006 seeking to set aside a judgment of Jessup J of 14 September 2006: see SZAQW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1332.
 Section 24(1AAA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides that: "An appeal may not be brought to the Court from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single Judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. " 3 In my view, a judgment concerning an application for leave to appeal is a judgment "in relation to an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court".
