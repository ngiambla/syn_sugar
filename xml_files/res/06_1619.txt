 1 This is a notice of motion of 14 November 2006 seeking to set aside a judgment of Jessup J of 14 September 2006: see SZAQW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1332.
 Section 24(1AAA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides that: "An appeal may not be brought to the Court from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single Judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. " 3 In my view, a judgment concerning an application for leave to appeal is a judgment "in relation to an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court".
 In appropriate circumstances the Court can exercise an implied statutory power to set aside an order made in the absence of the party where the absence was through no fault of that party: see also SZISF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1612. 4 In the present case the decision of Jessup J involved consideration of whether or not the Federal Magistrate's decision was infected by error, which in turn involved consideration of the way in which the Tribunal dealt with the matter.
