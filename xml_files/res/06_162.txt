 In a written statement to the Tribunal he claimed that he had joined the Muslim League in 1996, and that he had been appointed a senior member of his branch in 1998.
 When the matter next came before the Tribunal, at the second hearing of his claim, the appellant stated that his lawyer had "disappeared" from Mumbai, and that the documents were therefore unavailable.
 The Tribunal rejected his application for a further adjournment, and described his evidence on this point as "thoroughly unconvincing". 11 In summary, the Tribunal found the appellant's evidence to be far-fetched, and unconvincing in relation to the series of bribes that he claimed to have paid to the Indian authorities, and in relation to his supposed encounters with the Chief Inspector.
