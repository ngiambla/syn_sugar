 The Tribunal in that matter found that the adjustment disorder was first suffered during the events at the time of, and connected with, the procedures employed in relation to three promotions for which the appellant had applied unsuccessfully.
 The failure to obtain the promotions materially contributed to the condition and there is no issue but that the condition was suffered as a result of the failure to obtain the promotion. " 17 Subject to what I have to say about Mr Wiegand's no evidence claim, in light of the findings made and the decision in Hart the present application must be dismissed.
 THE APPEAL 18 As I have indicated, Mr Wiegand accepts that unless he can impugn the findings made by the Tribunal in relation to the 1989 promotion and the 1997 compassionate leave, his application must be dismissed because of Hart's case.
