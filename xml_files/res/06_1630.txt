 The other proceedings to which I shall refer also arise out of the same corporate collapse. 3 CGU has applied by motion pursuant to s 5(4) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (Cth) that the proceedings in this Court be transferred to the Commercial List of the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
 That application was dismissed by Bergin J on 3 September 2003: Silbermann v CGU Insurance Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 21. 7 On 9 September 2004, White J, by consent, made the compensation orders in the Supreme Court proceedings brought by ASIC against Mr Greaves to which I have referred: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (2004) 50 ACSR 500. 8 On 24 September 2004, Bergin J granted leave to Mr Greaves to discontinue the proceedings brought by him against CGU.
 In any event, Mr Street says that the Supreme Court is plainly the Court that ought to determine whether it is appropriate for all three claims against CGU to be heard together and to make appropriate directions for the purpose of bringing them to hearing. 12 Ms Adamson SC, who appeared with Mr Scruby for the Trustee, disputes that the proceedings in this Court and the Rich and Silbermann proceedings are in truth related.
 There is sufficient material before me, including the defence filed by CGU in the discontinued claim by Mr Greaves, to demonstrate the potential overlap between the proceedings in this Court and the Rich and Silbermann proceedings in the Supreme Court. 18 In my view it is in the interests of justice that these proceedings be transferred to the Commercial List of the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
