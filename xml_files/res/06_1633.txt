 The form of contract purported to be on the same terms and conditions as the contract made between Peter Smyth and Red Valley in September 2005 as amended on 1 March 2006, save that the deposit of $140,000 was payable forthwith.
 By way of reply, the Chippers admit that, on 22 October and 8 November 2005, Peter Smyth offered to sell the farm to them on the same terms and conditions, and for the same cash consideration, as the farm was then offered for sale to Red Valley.
 The right is merely contractual and no equitable interest in the land is created by the agreement. 74 The second judgment is that of Fullagar and Kitto JJ in Woodroffe v Box [1954] HCA 22 ; (1954) 92 CLR 245.
