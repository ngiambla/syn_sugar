 1 The plaintiff claims pursuant to letters of administration ad colligendum bona of the estate of Prudence Teng Fong Goh (his sister) against their sister, Judith Goh (the second defendant), various relief concerning the affairs of the first defendant (the Company). 3 Judith Goh's defence is that by a Minute of the Company dated 31 March 2004, she was appointed as a director and provided with a share allocation.
 She also claims that some of her earnings as a gynaecologist were paid directly into the bank account of the Company and that as a result she was to be given a share allocation. 4 On 2 November 2006 the plaintiff filed a notice of motion seeking orders that discovery be made of Judith's taxation returns and any documents from the Company's accountant relating to the preparation of its taxation returns and financial reports.
 There will be an order in terms of par 1 of the notice of motion. 6 The usual obligations, for which Harman v Home Department State Secretary [1983] 1 AC 280 is the leading authority, restrict the use to which a party that receives documents by way of discovery may put them.
