 The applicant holds such a policy covering him until 10 May 2007, with a $1 million limit of indemnity and an aggregate limit of indemnity of $2 million. 4 As a registered industrial agent/advocate, Mr King has a duty to comply with the code of conduct in Sch 1 of the abovementioned Regulations.
 That is, they make apparent that it is the 'other Act' which prevails over the provision of the subsections of the Workplace Relations Act , even though the subsections are expressed in very categorical language involving the use of the word 'only'. 12 That being the case, it is necessary for me to consider the application for leave pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court Act.
 While Mr King would not have the overall duty of a barrister or solicitor to the Court, he is subject to certain codes which, even though not extending the role for which he seeks leave to perform, could be adversely affected if he were to mis-perform if leave were granted by the Court.
 That is, he would assist the interests of justice. 13 I therefore find that Mr King is in a quite different position to the unsuccessful applicants for the grant of leave in either Melaleuca or 'Pooncarie' . 14 I also take into account that the applicant does not oppose the grant of leave.
