 The applicant holds such a policy covering him until 10 May 2007, with a $1 million limit of indemnity and an aggregate limit of indemnity of $2 million. 4 As a registered industrial agent/advocate, Mr King has a duty to comply with the code of conduct in Sch 1 of the abovementioned Regulations.
 That is, he would assist the interests of justice. 13 I therefore find that Mr King is in a quite different position to the unsuccessful applicants for the grant of leave in either Melaleuca or 'Pooncarie' . 14 I also take into account that the applicant does not oppose the grant of leave.
