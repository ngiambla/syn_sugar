 It considered that his evidence was vague and inconsistent and rejected them on that basis. 5 However, the RRT went on to say that in any event there were other reasons for finding that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds which were claimed.
 The RRT observed in particular that it was satisfied that the appellant would not become politically active again in Sri Lanka because the wishes of his family and his conscience would not allow him to do so. 6 The RRT did not accept the appellant's claimed fear of harm for reasons of his race.
 It relied on independent country information to find that, although there had been reports of clashes between Muslims and Tamils, these clashes did not take place in Colombo where the appellant had lived and worked for many years. 7 The RRT concluded its reasons by stating that, even if the appellant were to become politically active on his return to Sri Lanka, independent country information showed a diversity of opinion about the peace process which was then in train.
 I do not consider that this ground of appeal is made out. 14 The decision of a Full Court in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at [24] in the joint judgment of Finn and Stone JJ contains a useful summary of the meaning of the term "information" in s 424A(1).
