 The RRT affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister not to grant the appellant a protection visa. 2 The appellant claimed to be a citizen of Sri Lanka and also claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of his political opinion and his race.
 The RRT observed in particular that it was satisfied that the appellant would not become politically active again in Sri Lanka because the wishes of his family and his conscience would not allow him to do so. 6 The RRT did not accept the appellant's claimed fear of harm for reasons of his race.
 The appellant submits that the effect of this decision is that the RRT, having made up its mind to dismiss the application, was required to provide that information to the appellant in order to comply with the provisions of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
