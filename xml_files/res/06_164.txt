 Spirit wishes to make submissions on those issues when they are first before the Court. 17 There has been correspondence between Pfizer and Spirit in which Pfizer may have threatened infringement proceedings with respect to products said to be encompassed by the claims of the patent.
 That may give rise to a question of unjustified threats of infringement in the event that this appeal is unsuccessful. 18 Spirit has not commenced proceedings for unjustified threats under s128 of the Act or for rectification of the Register.
