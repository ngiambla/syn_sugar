 It stated that it would inform him in writing as soon as a new date had been fixed. 8 On 5 September 2005 the Tribunal again wrote to the appellant in terms similar to those contained in the letter of 13 July 2005.
 The Tribunal observed that it had not had the opportunity through a hearing to obtain further information to determine the veracity of the claims and accordingly that it could not be satisfied that the appellant met the criteria for recognition as a refugee. 13 The Tribunal set out a list of matters on which it was unable to be satisfied as a result of the failure of the appellant to attend the hearing.
 The information which he seeks time to gather can have no relevance whatsoever to the issues raised on this appeal. 36 Because the appellant is unrepresented, I have carefully considered the reasons given by the learned Federal Magistrate and by the Tribunal.
