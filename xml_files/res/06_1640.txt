 That does not seem to be a ground of appeal but rather an assertion which does not establish error on the part of the Tribunal, let alone error going to jurisdiction. 25 It may be that the appellant seeks to raise a submission that the Tribunal had a duty to conduct its own independent inquiries.
 The information which he seeks time to gather can have no relevance whatsoever to the issues raised on this appeal. 36 Because the appellant is unrepresented, I have carefully considered the reasons given by the learned Federal Magistrate and by the Tribunal.
 I am satisfied that no error is disclosed in the Federal Magistrate's reasons and that no jurisdictional error can be seen in the decision of the RRT. 37 It is well established that the scheme contemplated by Part 7 of the Migration Act expressly contemplates that in particular circumstances an appellant will not attend a hearing, including cases involving no fault of the applicant.
