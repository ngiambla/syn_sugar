 Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate was of the view that the alleged breach of s 424A was not made out. 8 The second ground of review was that the Tribunal did not make a genuine and realistic attempt to arrive at its decision in a bona fide manner.
 The first ground is that the Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error because it did not afford the appellant the benefit of the doubt when there was no material to the contrary of that which the appellant asserted.
 Rather, what is required is a refusal of an application if the decision-maker is not affirmatively satisfied that the criteria for the visa in question have been satisfied; see for example Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73. 12 The first ground of appeal states in addition that the Federal Magistrates Court failed to give consideration to this claim.
 See also SZCIJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 62 at [8] . 15 In any event there is no evidence before the court to demonstrate that the Tribunal member failed to provide the appellant with any opportunity to comment on the critical issues that arose for consideration and upon which the Tribunal member based her decision; see NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 at [21] . 16 To the extent that the second ground of appeal seeks to raise a breach of s 424A(1) of the Migration Act , I do not consider that such an argument can succeed.
