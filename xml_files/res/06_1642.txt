 THE DECISION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL 16 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal concluded that Mrs Waldron is entitled to a double orphan pension for Isabelle, until Isabelle is adopted by them under Australian law. 17 The Tribunal identified the purpose of the double orphan pension as being to ensure that a person caring for a young person who has no living parents who would otherwise be entitled to receive a benefit for that child, shall have the same rights as if they were a parent.
 It said the meaning of "parent" in s 993 and in s 5(1) should not be extended to persons who have adopted a child under the law of an overseas country, notwithstanding that the definition of "adopted child" includes a young person adopted under the law of any place, whether in Australia or not.
 The characteristic for eligibility that there be no living natural or adoptive parent indicates that the absence of a person in a parental role in relation to a particular child is important, presumably because the parent otherwise is available to, and obliged to, provide that support and assistance to the child.
