 THE DECISION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL 16 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal concluded that Mrs Waldron is entitled to a double orphan pension for Isabelle, until Isabelle is adopted by them under Australian law. 17 The Tribunal identified the purpose of the double orphan pension as being to ensure that a person caring for a young person who has no living parents who would otherwise be entitled to receive a benefit for that child, shall have the same rights as if they were a parent.
 The characteristic for eligibility that there be no living natural or adoptive parent indicates that the absence of a person in a parental role in relation to a particular child is important, presumably because the parent otherwise is available to, and obliged to, provide that support and assistance to the child.
