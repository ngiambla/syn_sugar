 Schaefer contends that the SEF was therefore not prepared in accordance with law and that it thereby vitiates the subsequent Trade Measures Report as well as the Minister's decision. 13 Schaefer makes this claim notwithstanding that it took up the statutory opportunity accorded to it to make submissions in response to the SEF.
 The effect of these provisions is that the CEO is to make recommendations which enable the Minister to reach a state of satisfaction as to whether there is a causal link between the export price and material injury to the Australian industry. 16 In the Trade Measures Report, Customs dealt with five tender contracts won by Schaefer for the supply of MGBs to local councils or their waste contractors.
 Rather, it is a document which the CEO must place on the public record for the benefit of interested parties. 136 Section 269TDAA(1) states in clear terms that the document is to contain a statement of the facts on which the CEO proposes to base his or her recommendation.
 The question which then arises is whether it was irrational, perverse or unreasonable for the CEO not to accept the contractor's statements that factors other than price were determinative. 218 It seems to me that the CEO dealt with the contractor's evidence in the passage I have set out at [97].
