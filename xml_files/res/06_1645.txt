 Further, his Honour correctly observed that the Tribunal in reaching its conclusion that the Appellant misrepresented his true identity, relied upon information the subject of the Tribunal's letter dated 21 April 2004 to which the Appellant replied by submitting a declaration to the Tribunal dated 16 May 2004 as to the relevant matters [22]. 47 As to the third category of information, his Honour noted that the Tribunal relied upon information contained in the Appellant's protection visa application in which the Appellant set out details of his educational background and experience to the effect that the Appellant had received 14 years of formal education in Suzhou City culminating in a University degree in 1982 and details of his employment history to the effect that the Appellant had been employed at the Price Bureau of Suzhou City from May 1983 to November 2003.
 His Honour also observed that having isolated the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision and determined whether the decision rests upon information forming a part of the reason for affirming the decision, particulars of which, in breach of s 424A(1) , were not provided to the Appellant, and also rests on other grounds independent of that contravention and those grounds are not shown to be impeached, the decision of the Tribunal will remain a decision made according to law, having regard to any unimpeached independent ground.
 His Honour, in reaching this conclusion, relied upon VBAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 965 ; SZDXC v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1306 ; MZWPK v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1256 ; and VCAD v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 1. 51 His Honour then concluded that the Tribunal's reliance upon inconsistencies between statements contained in the Appellant's protection visa application and his oral evidence could not be considered integral to the Tribunal's decision having regard to the brevity of the reference to the inconsistencies in the context of other key conclusions concerning findings as to the credibility of the Appellant.
