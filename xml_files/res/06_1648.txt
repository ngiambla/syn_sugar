 Dr James Lynch, who referred to the total amount involved as being about $100,000, said that, by the time they identified the error, they were able to recover only about $7,000.
 Dr Lynch could not recall whether, as the applicant said in her evidence, she (the applicant) had told Dr Lynch that she saw the note and became "sick and distressed". 51 In her conversation with the applicant on 22 February 2005, just what Dr Sandra Lynch said to the applicant about returning to work, and why she said it, were not entirely unambiguous in the evidence.
 However, there may be an argument that, if Dr Lynch did hand the contract back to the applicant and the applicant accepted it, the parties had thereby consensually revoked the contract into which they had so recently entered.
