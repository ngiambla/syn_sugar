 The circumstances in which the contraventions by the first respondent occurred (and in which it was alleged Mr Carney was knowingly concerned) are explained in his Honour's reasons at [5] to [19] and need not be repeated here.
 They related to the marketing of sporting products to supporters of Australian Football League clubs and involved attempts by the first respondent (which were to a significant extent successful) to exclude competitor's products from retail outlets.
 The ACCC discontinued the proceeding against the third respondent and he gave evidence against Mr Carney. 2 The trial of the proceeding between the ACCC and Mr Carney commenced on 28 August 2006 and was estimated at that time to take three weeks.
