 In substance, there was an order directing discovery and it is that order against which the Director-General of Security seeks leave to appeal. 2 Under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), I have to exercise a discretion as to the grant of leave. 3 There are two proceedings: Parkin v O'Sullivan (VID 1594 of 2005), and Sagar and Faisal v O'Sullivan (VID 188 of 2006), the discovery applications in which were heard together because they raised similar questions of law.
 According to a public report by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security dated 29 November 2005, Mr Parkin describes himself as "a proponent of non-violent direct action and peaceful civil disobedience against the war in Iraq". 4 His visa was cancelled in September 2005 because of an adverse security assessment issued by the Director-General appointed pursuant to s 7 Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth).
 They were taken to Nauru in September 2002 and have been held in immigration detention since then. 8 The claims by Mr Parkin and Messrs Sagar and Faisal are made under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) which invests the Federal Court with jurisdiction with respect to any matter in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or injunction is sought against an officer or officers of the Commonwealth.
 They claim orders quashing the decision of the Director-General to issue the adverse security assessments against them and declarations that the assessments were made contrary to law, relying on s 20 of the ASIO Act which they allege requires the Director-General to ensure that only "lawful security assessments" are made. 9 Before his Honour the respondents, who were represented by senior and junior counsel, formally acknowledged that they "do not shy away from the fact that they have no idea how ASIO could have reached the conclusions it did in the security assessments it provided". 10 The ASIO legislation and his Honour's reasons are set out in full in his judgment, and it is not necessary for me to repeat them.
 I propose to grant leave to appeal for essentially four reasons. 11 First, there is an arguable case that his Honour did not correctly apply authorities binding on him which say that the bare assertion of a claim without any factual foundation will not justify an order for discovery: Church of Scientology v Woodward [1980] HCA 38 ; (1982) 154 CLR 25, Lloyd and Costigan (1983) 82 FLR 104 at 113-114, WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1980) 41 FLR 175 at 181, Minister for Immigration v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 at [30] and Jilani v Wilhelm [2005] FCAFC 269 ; (2005) 148 FCR 255 at 273-274.
 Moreover, this approach is the more justified in cases where questions of national security are involved; see the Church of Scientology case. 12 Secondly, it is arguable that in stressing the distinction between discovery, which merely requires the identification of documents, and production, which requires documents to be made available and for inspection, his Honour did not give sufficient weight to the risk that identification of documents in itself may give rise to national security problems. 13 Thirdly, in an affidavit in support of the present application Mr Michael John Brereton, a solicitor with the Office of the Australian Government Solicitor, deposed: "I am instructed that irreparable harm may be caused if leave to appeal is not granted, in that the Director-General will be required to swear and file an affidavit of documents which of itself, and separately and distinct from the question of production of documents, may reveal matters the disclosure of which could be prejudicial to national security. " 14 This affidavit, or material to the same effect, was apparently not before his Honour, but I see no reason why I should not take it into account in exercising my discretion on the question of leave to appeal. 15 Fourthly, the balance to be struck between the exercise of normal litigation processes and the interests of national security raise issues of great public importance.
