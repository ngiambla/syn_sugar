 According to a public report by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security dated 29 November 2005, Mr Parkin describes himself as "a proponent of non-violent direct action and peaceful civil disobedience against the war in Iraq". 4 His visa was cancelled in September 2005 because of an adverse security assessment issued by the Director-General appointed pursuant to s 7 Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth).
 They were taken to Nauru in September 2002 and have been held in immigration detention since then. 8 The claims by Mr Parkin and Messrs Sagar and Faisal are made under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) which invests the Federal Court with jurisdiction with respect to any matter in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or injunction is sought against an officer or officers of the Commonwealth.
 I propose to grant leave to appeal for essentially four reasons. 11 First, there is an arguable case that his Honour did not correctly apply authorities binding on him which say that the bare assertion of a claim without any factual foundation will not justify an order for discovery: Church of Scientology v Woodward [1980] HCA 38 ; (1982) 154 CLR 25, Lloyd and Costigan (1983) 82 FLR 104 at 113-114, WA Pines Pty Ltd v Bannerman (1980) 41 FLR 175 at 181, Minister for Immigration v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 at [30] and Jilani v Wilhelm [2005] FCAFC 269 ; (2005) 148 FCR 255 at 273-274.
