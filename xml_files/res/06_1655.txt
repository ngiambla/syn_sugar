 Dr Tym can give an opinion that the Applicant's depression was caused by his relationship with [the female employee] --- and for the purposes of this matter it may be assumed (but I do not so find) that this was a relationship in which [the female employee] harassed the Applicant.
 This would be so even if all the interactions between [Mr Dunstan] and [the female employee] were in the course of his employment, for the cumulative effect of those interactions which brought on his depression could, as I have said, just as well have done so [sic] when he was not at work as when he was.
 In any event it is clear from the evidence that many stressful interactions between [Mr Dunstan] and [the female employee] took place when he was not at work. ... for the most part ... their interactions as colleagues were not stressful.
