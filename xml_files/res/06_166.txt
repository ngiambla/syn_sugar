 On 19 September 2003, the appellant (and her husband) applied for a protection visa and, on 31 October 2003 a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ("the Minister") refused to grant the appellant a protection visa.
 On 14 September 2005, Emmett J ordered the time for filing and serving a notice of appeal be extended to 16 September 2005: SZEGX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1379.
 On the evidence before it, the Tribunal could not be satisfied that the appellant was active in Falun Gong and was detained by the Chinese authorities for three weeks in June 2000 and that, as a consequence, she had lost her job and experienced ongoing harassment.
 In the present case, the Tribunal was simply articulating a reason why it had not reached the requisite level of satisfaction that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution.
