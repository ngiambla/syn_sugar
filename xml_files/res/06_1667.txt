 The application of the correct test 4 Mrs Byrne relevantly posited to the Tribunal that her husband's ability to survive in the waters of Tantangara Dam when his boat overturned was impaired by war-caused CAD.
 The Tribunal accepted that hypothesis to be reasonable (at [89]). ( Byrnes v Repatriation Commission [1993] HCA 51 ; (1993) 177 CLR 564 at 571; Repatriation Commission v Deledio (1998) 83 FCR 82 at 91). 5 The second ground of appeal alleges that the Tribunal failed to apply that test correctly.
 Failure to give sufficient reasons 8 The first and primary ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to refer to the evidence or other material that was the basis for its finding that CAD did not contribute to Mr Byrne's death.
 Mrs Byrne submits that the Tribunal gave no reasons or no sufficient reasons for that conclusion as required by s 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). 9 It is necessary to have some understanding of the context of the Tribunal's conclusion and the structure of the Tribunal's decision.
