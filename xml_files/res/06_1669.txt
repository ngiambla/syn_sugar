 The then solicitors for Mr Sobey responded by letter of 8 September 2005 enclosing copy cheques indicating two payments of money to Mr Mercorella, and asserting the existence of "an unregistered mortgage which had been executed prior to the Federal Court injunction".
 They pointed out that it had taken some time for a copy of the mortgage and loan agreement to be provided, and that those documents had not been provided in response to a summons for examination served upon Mr Sobey when he attended in Court for examination on 24 November 2004.
 It referred to the examination of Mr Sobey to take place on 22 December 2005 and that he would be required to produce documentation relating to his claims and to be examined on them. 20 The following day, the solicitors for Mr Sobey responded.
