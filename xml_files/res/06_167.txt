 On 6 May 2004, a Full Court of this Court refused to extend the time for filing an application for leave to appeal, refused leave to appeal, and dismissed the appellant's purported appeal as incompetent.
 It is plain that none of that had been done by the appellant, and plain that the federal magistrate regarded the absence of any application for leave as a ground for his dismissal of the substantive application that he regarded as before him.
 If the basis for dismissing the application was that there had been no application for leave to file it and, therefore no leave granted to file it, then the federal magistrate had no choice but to dismiss the application.
 For reasons that I have already given, and that I endeavoured to explain to the appellant, that would have been material, and evidence, not relevant to any issue that was before the Federal Magistrates Court.
