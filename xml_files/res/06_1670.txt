 I am not satisfied that there is such a prima facie case for relief. 3 The proceeding arises out of a decision by a delegate of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (the Delegate) to terminate a complaint of breach of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth).
 The Delegate was, therefore, of the view that the requirements under s 18C(1)(b) of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 were not satisfied. 6 The Delegate was also of the view that, even if the members of the Christian Churches of God did constitute an ethnic group, the material complained of could not be considered to be 'reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' them on the basis of their 'ethnic origin'.
 I can see nothing in the information given to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, in the additional material that has been provided by Mr Cox or in what Mr Cox said in Court on 6 November 2006 which assists his case.
