 Whilst it might be possible to schedule a date in February that is not a straightforward exercise having regard to my present commitments and I begin a six to eight week trial in the second week of March. 4 In the circumstances, I regret that whilst it is an unsatisfactory balance of interests judgement from some points of view, I feel obliged to refuse the adjournment, that is to say, to refuse the motion to vacate the trial date.
