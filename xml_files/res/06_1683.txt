 I subsequently compiled information about the Charlie family during research for a report prepared in 1995 by Dr Lee Sackett for the Dingaal Native Title Claim, for the Hopevale Native Title Determination, and more recently (since 2002) for the current Dingaal claim. 4. [An additional numbering error].
 Dr Powell, as the evidence recited at [18] demonstrates, has been involved in the preparation of a connection report, has completed approximately two thirds of the work leading to a connection report and has been engaged in a compilation of genealogical information concerning Hope Vale families including the Charlie family since the 1970's.
 Plainly enough, the evidence of Dr Powell is persuasive for interlocutory purposes having regard to the evidence of Mr Neill Phillipson of a cursory examination of material. 29 Secondly, Mr Black says that in the absence of an interlocutory order enjoining the meeting, the claims of the Brim family members articulated by Mr Charlie will be irreparably lost.
 I am further satisfied that having regard to the extensive steps taken to convene the meeting and the dislocation caused by enjoining the meeting, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of making no interlocutory order. 31 Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the Notice of Motion. 32 The CYLC has sought an order for costs of the proceeding.
