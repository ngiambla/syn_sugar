 The Principal Member had dismissed Mr Rodda's application to the Veterans' Review Board ('the Board') for review of a decision of the Repatriation Commission ('the Commission'). 2 At issue is the proper construction of s 155AA and s 155AC of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 ('the Act').
 The Commission's decision 4 The Commission accepted that several but not all of Mr Rodda's claimed medical conditions were related to his military service and granted him a pension at 100 percent of the General Rate (as opposed to the higher Intermediate or Special Rates of pension).
 The Act places more onerous eligibility requirements for the (higher) Intermediate or Special rates of pension on applicants aged 65 years and over: see s 23(3A) and (3B), and s 24(2A) and (2B), so that it would now be significantly harder for Mr Rodda to qualify for those higher rates.
