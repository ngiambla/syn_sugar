 The Principal Member had dismissed Mr Rodda's application to the Veterans' Review Board ('the Board') for review of a decision of the Repatriation Commission ('the Commission'). 2 At issue is the proper construction of s 155AA and s 155AC of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 ('the Act').
 The form also stated that Mr Woodcock would advise the Board when both men were ready for a hearing to be arranged. 7 On 8 January 2003 the Board wrote to Mr Rodda informing him that his application would be listed for hearing as soon as his representative sent a 'Certificate of Readiness'.
 The express statutory scheme would be rendered pointless. 57 The second reason is that the result which follows for the applicant is not so unexpected that it might have, as it were, passed under the radar of parliamentarians when they enacted the relevant dispositive amendments.
