 Such Principles described the information necessary to inform the ABA of the community needs to be addressed by the proposed community broadcasting service, and generally correspond to the specific matters which the ABA is to take into consideration in its assessment of a licence application made under s 84 of the Act.
 The number of letters it is submitted was an essential element in the finding and not merely incidental to it because the ABA referred to it specifically as constituting a ' high number '. 61 PCR submits that more than half of such letters could not have provided evidence of 'need' within the licence area because they were undated and were created prior to 22 November 2002, being the date of incorporation of GCB.
 I consider that the programs would be similar although varied to incorporate local content. 79 I am satisfied that the particular programs proposed were those intended by GCB and that the ABA correctly directed itself to the requirements of s 84(2)(a) when it assessed the ' proposed service ' of GCB.
