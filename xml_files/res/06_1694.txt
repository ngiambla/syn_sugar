 However, because the Tribunal's decision was delivered after the expiration of the visa, the decision had no effect. 6 On 30 June 2004 Ms Ogawa lodged an application for judicial review to the Federal Court of Australia of the Tribunal's decision of 9 June 2004.
 Apparently she considered there was some merit in doing so, even though the decision of the Tribunal was substantively in her favour. 7 On 6 July 2004, Ms Ogawa was granted a Bridging E class visa, subclass 050, on the basis that she had applied for judicial review of a decision relating to a substantive visa.
 Pursuant to the Migration Regulations 1994 ('the Regulations') clause 050.512, such visa is valid for a period of 28 days after the judicial review proceedings are completed. 8 On 23 July 2004 the Federal Court dismissed Ms Ogawa's application for judicial review.
 His Honour said: 'It should be made clear that a Bridging visa of the type held by the Applicant was one which remained in force until the completion of migration proceedings or judicial review proceedings, including proceedings on appeal, are completed and 28 days thereafter.
 She claims that in consequence of this recent development, her Bridging visa issued on 6 July 2004 remains in force and has never expired. 20 Ms Ogawa submits alternatively that irrespective of His Honour's decision, her Bridging visa has not expired.
 Regardless of these circumstances, the Court concludes that there was no error by Scarlett FM in making his finding that Ms Ogawa's Bridging visa expired on 17 February 2005 by virtue of Rule 41.10.4 of the High Court Rules . 27 It follows that as at 19 May 2006 Ms Ogawa did not hold a Bridging visa and was accordingly an unlawful non-citizen.
 The letter relevantly states: 'Therefore, given that you no longer have any court proceedings against the department it is now appropriate for the Minister to consider your request under section 351 of the Act. ' The letter invited her to make submissions within 35 days and stated: 'You may now be eligible for a Bridging Visa E in respect of your section 351 request.
 You should contact the nearest DIMIA compliance section in this regard. ' 33 By letter from the Minister dated 17 June 2005 (but not written from the MIU) Ms Ogawa was notified that the Bridging visa granted in Brisbane on 6 July 2004 ceased on 17 February 2005 and that she was therefore an unlawful non-citizen.
 The letter further advised her that she may be eligible for a Bridging E visa. 34 By email addressed to the MIU and sent on 28 September 2005, Ms Ogawa advised: 'The High Court registrars will not oppose my application in the Federal Court.
 If in the future you wish to request the Minister to intervene in your case under s351 of the Migration Act 1958 it is open for you to make such a request. ' 37 Ms Ogawa has maintained that she did not receive this message and was unaware that such communication was made.
 She refers to Scargill v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 116 at para 29. 41 Ms Ogawa thereafter refers to the observations made by Scarlett FM of the MIU and of his observation that the ' Department acted wrongly ' in withdrawing Ms Ogawa's request.
