 However, because the Tribunal's decision was delivered after the expiration of the visa, the decision had no effect. 6 On 30 June 2004 Ms Ogawa lodged an application for judicial review to the Federal Court of Australia of the Tribunal's decision of 9 June 2004.
 Ms Ogawa then sought leave to appeal to the Full Federal Court against such decision, but on 26 November 2004 the Full Court refused her application for leave to appeal. 9 Ms Ogawa then filed an application on 22 December 2004 in the High Court of Australia against the decision of the Full Federal Court to refuse leave to appeal.
 The Tribunal said that it was ' unable to place weight on the fact that the applicant alleges she was not aware that her request for Ministerial Intervention had been withdrawn . ' The Tribunal held that it was not concerned with the question whether or not the request was correctly or incorrectly withdrawn.
 She refers to Scargill v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 116 at para 29. 41 Ms Ogawa thereafter refers to the observations made by Scarlett FM of the MIU and of his observation that the ' Department acted wrongly ' in withdrawing Ms Ogawa's request.
