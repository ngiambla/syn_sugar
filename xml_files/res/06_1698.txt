 Consequently, the "supply" of the timber by the Territory to ACOC did not activate s 117(1) at all because the "use" referred to must be an infringing use. 17 Section 13(1) provides a patentee with exclusive rights to exploit the invention or to authorise another person to do so.
 The distinguishing feature, it was said, was that the Territory had "written off" the trees on the Howard Springs land as a commercial crop for use as timber (which they described as included within the term silverculture) in November 1995, and therefore that the Territory thereafter regarded the Howard Springs land as only suitable for clearing so that the licences permitting the removal of the timber were merely part of a "salvage" operation.
 Indeed, the evidence discloses that it was not simply ACOC, but the Collins and others, who were interested in negotiating with the Territory for the right to enter the Howard Springs land and to remove and use the trees or the bark and wood from the trees. 33 The expression that the tree plantation be "written off" as a production area emerged from the recommendations in the Report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, May 1978, entitled "Northern Territory Forestry Program" (AGPS, Canberra, 1978).
 It also confirms that in fact the timber on the Howard Springs land had, and continued to have, value to the Territory. 34 When the decision was taken that the trees in their then configuration were not suitable for their initially intended forestry use for timber, it was acknowledged that there were other commercial uses for it.
