 In its decision, the Tribunal recounted all the relevant facts and circumstances and noted that there was no factual dispute about the significant events. 10 The Tribunal found that the appellant failed to declare to the Department that he had not been in an exclusive relationship with his wife and his affair with Ms Hoang had resulted in the birth of his daughter.
 It then proceeded to consider the exercise of the discretion to cancel the appellant's visa in accordance with reg 2.41 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations'). 11 In considering the circumstances prescribed under reg 2.41, the Tribunal found that the appellant's extra-marital relationship was likely to have impacted on the outcome of his visa application.
 However Riethmuller FM found that due to the appellant not disputing that he had separated from his spouse, that he had fathered a child, and that he did not have a degree from Swinburne, there was no call upon the Tribunal to make detailed findings about these issues and instead the Tribunal correctly reviewed the facts and circumstances and exercised afresh the relevant discretion. 15 In relation to the appellant's contention that the Tribunal had erred in finding that the appellant and his wife were not in a spousal relationship for the purposes of reg 1.15A(1A), Riethmuller FM held that the Tribunal had only to consider the likely effect of the non-compliance on the outcome of the visa application.
