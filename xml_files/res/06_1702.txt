 In each case the demand was supported by an affidavit verifying that the amount of the debt claimed was due and owing by the company to Westpoint Corporation. 7 The verifying affidavits depended upon examination of the books and records of Westpoint Corporation by Mr Zohar.
 Westpoint Corporation would simply "alter the loan account balance". 60 Mr Carey was pressed in cross-examination with the proposition that any debts owing by Westpoint Corporation to a member company would not be recoverable because Westpoint Corporation was in liquidation.
 This work had not been billed to Westpoint Corporation. 63 As to Bridgeview and the alleged error in the attribution of liabilities as between Bridgeview and Forestview, Mr Carey was unable, in cross-examination, to explain with any precision how that error occurred.
 The presumption applies to satisfy the condition of a prima facie case of insolvency necessary to ground ASIC's application for leave to apply for each of the respondents to be wound up in insolvency. 65 I am satisfied that ASIC should be granted leave to apply to wind up these companies.
