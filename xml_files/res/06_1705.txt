 2 These reasons for judgment should be read together with those two previous judgments. 4 As is apparent from the previous judgments, employees of Pratt and Maxim (Vic), who were members of the Union, were employed to perform work on 5 and 6 August 2003 at the Concept Blue site. 5 At 8.30 am on 5 August 2003, employees of Pratt and Maxim (Vic) stopped work to attend a meeting conducted by representatives of the Union.
 I also observed that the facts and circumstances were not materially distinguishable from those referred to in the Pratt matter. 18 I said that, as with Pratt's breaches of s 187AA and a certified agreement, the like breaches by Maxim (Vic) were inadvertent and unlikely to recur.
 I will impose the penalty for breach of the Act but not impose any additional penalty for breach of the certified agreement, in respect of which a declaration will be recorded. ' 19 No harm has been done to anyone as a result of the contraventions of s 187AB and the certified agreement binding Maxim (Vic) by the Union.
