 The Tribunal observed that it did not accept the Appellant's suggestion that the payment of a bribe had ensured the re-issuing of a Chinese passport at a time when the appellant was allegedly under investigation and subject to detention by the authorities.
 This was apparently a significant part of its reasons for this finding. 13 Nor did the Tribunal accept that when the appellant returned to Australia in August 2005 she did so for the purpose of seeking protection against harm feared from the Chinese authorities.
 The Tribunal gave reasons for this which are not necessary to repeat in my reasons for judgment. 18 The Tribunal also rejected the claim that the appellant was contacted by Falun Gong practitioners by text messages and by leaflets after she returned to China in February 2005.
