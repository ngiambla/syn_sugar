 I do not propose to set out the orders in full but in my view the proper construction of those paragraphs is that a list was to be supplied to the independent solicitor and the applicants' solicitor, of all materials removed from the premises which the respondents claimed to be privileged or confidential (the "Disputed Seized Material").
 The definition of Disputed Electronic Materials was given in Order 12 and it extends to documents which the respondents claim to be privileged or confidential. 19 Order 14 provides for the respondents to file and serve affidavits setting out the nature and basis of any claim for privilege or confidentiality.
 They stated that the results have been saved to a series of spreadsheets accompanying the report. 21 The computer experts' report was not provided to the solicitors for the respondents until 17 October 2006, and the relevant files ("Extracted Files") referred to therein were only made available for inspection on 8 November 2006.
 This, I think, is borne out by reference to and examination of the regime explained in Orders 12 to 14. 26 The respondents submit that the purpose of the search orders made by Allsop J on 30 June 2006 was to preserve evidence contained on various hard drives or computers located at their premises.
