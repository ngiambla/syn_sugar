 I do not propose to set out the orders in full but in my view the proper construction of those paragraphs is that a list was to be supplied to the independent solicitor and the applicants' solicitor, of all materials removed from the premises which the respondents claimed to be privileged or confidential (the "Disputed Seized Material").
 All material other than the Disputed Seized Material was then to be made available for inspection by the applicants and their solicitors. 12 There is also an exception for "Disputed Items" but that category is not in issue in the present application. 13 Order 6 provided for the respondents to file and serve an affidavit setting out, in relation to the Disputed Seized Material, the nature and basis of any objection or claim for privilege or confidentiality.
 The definition of Disputed Electronic Materials was given in Order 12 and it extends to documents which the respondents claim to be privileged or confidential. 19 Order 14 provides for the respondents to file and serve affidavits setting out the nature and basis of any claim for privilege or confidentiality.
