 Claims with respect to financial damage have clearly vested in the applicant's trustee in bankruptcy. 65 The applicant also complains of 'burglary, defamation and deception harassment and intimidation' (par 387) and that 'as a result of being the victim of crime or unlawful conduct (contrary to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act ) he suffered personal injury' (par 390). 66 In relation to this complaint I repeat my comments in pars (a) to (f) above under the discussion concerning Count 8. 67 Accordingly, the applicant lacks standing in respect of this claim.
 Count 10 paragraphs 391-416: as a result of the respondents engaging in deceptive and misleading conduct, unconscionable conduct and harassment of the applicant in relation to Toogoom land in contravention of sections 51AA , 52 and 60 Trade Practices Act , the applicant suffered personal injury 68 Similarly to Count 2, although the applicant claims that he suffered 'personal injury' in respect of this conduct of the respondents, the substance of this complaint is that he suffered financial injury in respect of transactions involving the Toogoom land.
 Count 28 paragraphs 687-701: in contravention of sections 51AA , 52 and 60 Trade Practices Act , the respondents tricked the applicant into agreeing to discontinue an action in exchange for a deed of settlement drawn up in August 2004 whereby the respondents offered to provide finance and to allow the applicant to arrange the Fingal property to be subdivided.
