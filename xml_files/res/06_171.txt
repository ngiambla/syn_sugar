 The consignee named on the bill of lading is the 75 th Squadron Flying Museum, of Richmond in Melbourne. 11 The containers have never been delivered to the consignee on the bill and are presently in storage at or near the Port of Melbourne, pursuant to orders of this Court first made on 24 June 2005.
 The parties included the Director, the Board of Trustees and the State, being the first, second and third consolidated plaintiffs (Mr Narakobi appearing for the first and third plaintiffs), CCS and China Navigation, being the the fifth- and sixth-named defendants, who are also the applicants in the Federal Court.
 The facsimile also sought advice as to whether S Moran Co's clients intended to appeal the National Court decision. 24 Also on 21 October 2005, and seemingly in reply to this correspondence S Moran Co wrote to Norton White and Dwyer Co to advise that an appeal was filed on 13 October 2005 and a stay on the National Court decision was obtained in the Supreme Court of Justice.
