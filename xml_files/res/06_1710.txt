 Introduction 1 On 28 June 2006 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) filed an application for the winding up, on the ground of insolvency, of Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Forestview).
 In its application ASIC relies upon a presumption of insolvency flowing from the appointment of receivers and managers of Forestview under a floating charge and the receiver and manager's subsequent possession and control of Forestview's property for the purpose of enforcing that charge.
 The appointment was effected by a deed between them and Perpetual as custodian of The ING Mortgage Pool for ING Funds Management Ltd as the responsible entity of the ING Mortgage Pool. 9 On 28 June 2006 ASIC filed an application in this Court, seeking leave to apply and applying for the winding up of Forestview on the ground of its insolvency.
