 Mr Backley conceded in cross-examination that if this is so it would follow that the risks and hurdles to which he pointed would fall away. 30 Mr Backley also conceded that emails migrated to the new system would be accessible so long as they had not been deleted or written over.
 Mr Garey's affidavit annexed a letter, dated 24 November 2006, written to the applicants' solicitors from Mr James Beaton, Mr Garey's supervising partner, in opposition to the orders sought in the motion. 32 Mr Beaton stated in the letter that the "discovery already provided has involved reviewing electronic records used by a number of individuals at the relevant time".
 And he said that Mr Hadley has not asked him to conduct an electronic search of the computer system of Quadrant for the purpose of discovery in the proceedings. 48 Moreover, Mr Gilman has not personally undertaken a search of Quadrant's system to confirm that the only email records are those that were printed out and placed on hard copy files. 49 It is true that Mr Gilman believes that one of his colleagues would have conducted a search at that time.
