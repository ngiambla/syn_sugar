 Paragraph 44 (69, 93, 124, 129, 167) 48 Paragraph 44 pleads that the provision of the '1999 Advice' was not suitable to the applicants' circumstances (which are identified); and, that, in the circumstances, the giving of the advice breached an express term and the due care and skill implied term, of the agreement.
 The respondents object that the allegations of breach are conclusions and contain vague and embarrassing expressions. 53 In my view, the material fact, namely, that the advice that was given was of such a character that it would not protect the applicants' standard of living in the future, was a sufficient pleading of the material fact.
 The particulars which identify the defects in the advice sufficiently inform the respondents of the case that they need to meet at trial, and are not objectionably vague and embarrassing. 54 In the event that further particulars are needed, a request for particulars can be made.
 The respondents are not required to plead to particulars, and the 'future consequences' referred to in the particulars, support the basis for the allegations of breach of duty. 59 Insofar as further clarification is required, a request for further and better particulars can be made.
