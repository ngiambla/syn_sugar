 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of O'Dwyer FM, given on 8 November 2005, dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal to refuse the applicant the grant of a protection visa. 2 The applicant is a national of Malaysia.
 It makes no mention of the applicant's failure to attend before O'Dwyer FM. 6 Although O'Dwyer FM did not publish reasons for his decision, it is clear from the transcript that the applicant did not attend the hearing, and that it was on this basis that his application was dismissed.
 In an affidavit sworn on 14 February 2006, Maria O'Regan, the solicitor for the respondents, deposed to a telephone conversation with the applicant on 8 February 2006 during which the applicant confirmed that he was aware that the matter was listed for 10 February 2006 but indicated that he would like to have the hearing moved to another date.
