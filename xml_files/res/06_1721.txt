 1 This appeal from the making of a sequestration order by Raphael FM ( Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd v Sood (No 2) [2006] FMCA 265) concerns the interplay between the bankruptcy legislation and the Federal proceeds of crime legislation, as did an earlier interlocutory issue ( Sood v Crown Diagnostic Imaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 715).
 At the hearing of the petition, the debtor argued that there was no act of bankruptcy as the bankruptcy notice was invalid and a nullity as for the purposes of s 40(1)(8) and s 41(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , execution of the judgment had been stayed by virtue of the orders made pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 . 5 The orders in question did not technically stay execution.
 The decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in relation to this very order in Director of Public Prosecutions v Sood (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, Studdert J, 7 February 2006), establishes that an unsecured creditor has effectively no status to make an application concerning the effect of a s 18 order.
