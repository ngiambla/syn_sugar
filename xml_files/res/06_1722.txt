 The affidavit is the four page affidavit in precisely the same terms as that attached to the letter of 26 October 2006 which foreshadowed the filing of the affidavit. 23 The short point made by the Defendant is that the Plaintiff did not serve the documents marked 'RM1', 'RM2' and 'RM3' to Robert McInnes's affidavit, as filed .
 The Defendant was also provided with a copy of the filed and sealed application document. 36 It seems to me that it is not correct to say that there must necessarily be in all cases a strict linear sequence in the filing of the affidavit and any exhibits or annexures to the affidavit and then service of that material.
