 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was the target of murder attempts (having been shot at on two occasions), or that his family was threatened with death. 7 The Tribunal concluded that the appellant's fear of harm in the context of generalised election violence that accompanies political campaigning in Sri Lanka was not a fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
 In the Tribunal's assessment, this would not amount to such a restriction on his right to participate in democratic processes that it amounts to persecution. 8 In all the circumstances, the Tribunal said that it was not satisfied that there is a real chance the appellant faces persecution in the reasonably foreseeable future for any Convention reason.
 Secondly, the first respondent submitted that the appellant has failed to explain the delay between the Tribunal's decision being handed down and his application for review being filed: see Re Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491. 19 The appellant appeared before me on 16 February 2006 with the aid of an interpreter.
 It is not necessary for me to consider the abuse of process point or the delay point. 23 I dismiss the appeal and order that the appellant pay the respondents' costs. 24 In oral submissions, counsel for the first respondent sought leave to amend the name of the first respondent in the title of the proceedings to 'Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' by removing the words 'and Indigenous'.
