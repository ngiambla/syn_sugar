 They serve the public interest by making it plain that conduct of the kind admitted by the respondents contravenes the Act: see Australian Consumer Competition Commission v Midland Brick Company Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329 at 333; Rural Press Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2003] HCA 75 ; (2003) 216 CLR 53 at 91. 12 The injunctive relief is clearly expressed so as to make it plain to the respondents what conduct on their parts is proscribed in the three year period during which the injunctions will be operative: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Francis [2004] FCA 487 ; (2004) 142 FCR 1 at 39. 13 The probation order is modelled on an order made by Merkel J in ACCC v Humax Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 706 ; (2005) ATPR 42-072.
 Thus, in giving weight to a joint submission on a proposal that would resolve a proceeding, the Court can have regard to the savings of resources both for a regulator, such as the Commission, and for the Court if the proposal were to be accepted.
 In particular, if a proposed penalty involves a discount from that which might otherwise be considered to be the appropriate penalty so as to reflect a degree of cooperation, the Court would expect the Commission to explain the basis upon which the discount had been calculated. ... [56] The Court will be mindful that, where an agreed penalty is proposed, there may be elements of compromise involved in both sides.
 For reasons such as those, if the Court is not disposed to impose a penalty proposed by the parties, it would be appropriate to give the parties the opportunity to withdraw consent for all of the proposed orders and to permit the proceeding to continue on a contested basis.
