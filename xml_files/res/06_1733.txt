 In that proceeding, on 28 November 2006, Ms Zegarac filed a notice of motion, paragraph 2 of which seeks the following relief: "Leave of the Court to appeal the Federal Magistrate Phipps decision out of time. " 2 I understand the proposed relief to be a request for the Court to extend the time within which Ms Zegarac is allowed to appeal from the judgment of Federal Magistrate Phipps of 16 December 2005.
 That includes appeals from judgments in matters arising under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth); see s 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 4 Under O 52 r 15(1) of the Rules of Court, a notice of appeal must be filed within 21 days after the date of the judgment appealed from or within such further time as is allowed upon a motion being filed within those 21 days.
 Cashmore M refused leave for the counterclaim to issue but during the course of his reasons for judgment, rejected Ms Zegarac's allegation that Mr Dellios had engaged in professional negligence. 12 Phipps FM noted that an appeal from the order of Cashmore M was dismissed by Cummins J in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 28 June 2005.
