 The Chief Stipendiary Magistrate, who is named as second respondent in the appeal proceedings, has advised the parties that the matter would be set down for hearing on 11 December 2006. 4 Mr Zentai applies for a stay pending the hearing and determination of the appeal in the following terms: 'That the extradition proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia brought by the [Republic of Hungary] against [Mr Zentai] be stayed pending the determination by the Full Court of the Federal Court of the appeal filed by [Mr Zentai] against the finding by Siopis J that Magistrates sitting on the Magistrates Court of Western Australia may exercise functions under the Extradition Act 1988 ( Cth). ' Mr Zentai contends that his appeal will be rendered nugatory if an order is not made that the Magistrates Court, in effect, stay the extradition proceedings against him until the determination of the appeal to the Full Court, which is said to involve a constitutional question about the validity of s 19 in so far as it confers functions under Commonwealth law upon State magistrates.
 There is, nevertheless, authority for the proposition, including my own decision in Tuncak and Others v Young (1987) 14 ALD 286, and that of Hely J in NAMU of 2002 v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 999 , and the earlier decision of Toohey J in Bercove v Hermes (No 2) (1983) 51 ALR 105 that is it open to a single judge, in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the Court and the application of the powers conferred upon judges of the Court under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to make an interlocutory order to ensure that an appeal to the Full Court, if successful, would not be nugatory, notwithstanding that the proceedings at first instance had been dismissed by the order of another judge of the Court. 6 Hely J in NAMU said (at [11]): 'The weight of authority thus favours the proposition that a single judge may, in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the Court, and notwithstanding the dismissal of proceedings at first instance, grant an interlocutory injunction to operate pending a determination of an appeal to a Full Court.
 The Motion was filed in the appeal proceedings, but that is an irregularity which is capable of being cured. ' In this case the order which is sought, as reflected in a minute of orders which has been submitted to the Court, would require the Chief Magistrate and the Magistrates Court to "be restrained from proceeding with any extradition process involving the applicant until further order".
