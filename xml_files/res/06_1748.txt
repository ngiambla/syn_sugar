 The Tribunal's attention was directed to the form of application for a personal services business determination briefly described above, where the ' business premises ' were described as existing ' in loft over separate garage '.
 The Tribunal found, as a matter of fact, that the Company's business premises consist of ' the garage and the office accommodation above it ' and that ' the garage accommodation is mainly used ' (emphasis added) by the Company for its business.
 The Tribunal went on to say that it was clear on the evidence ' that the buildings are separate one from the other ' and that ' the buildings are largely functionally independent of one another '.
 The Tribunal observed that the vehicles are the property of the Company and that, if there is any use of the vehicles in a private sense by Mrs Dixon or Mr Dixon, it is use by them of the Company's property.
