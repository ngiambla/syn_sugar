 INTRODUCTION 1 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, on an application made by Ms Debra Barry, reviewed three determinations made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the SRC Act') concerning the liability of Australian Postal Corporation to pay compensation to Ms Barry following an incident in which Ms Barry hurt her back while delivering mail.
 I see no reason to conclude that the Tribunal was not aware of its statutory obligation to include in its written reasons for decision its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based (s 43(2B)) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth)).
