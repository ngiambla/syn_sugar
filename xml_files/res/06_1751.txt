 INTRODUCTION 1 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, on an application made by Ms Debra Barry, reviewed three determinations made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the SRC Act') concerning the liability of Australian Postal Corporation to pay compensation to Ms Barry following an incident in which Ms Barry hurt her back while delivering mail.
 This ambiguity in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal need not be resolved in this proceeding. 15 After reviewing the medical evidence the Tribunal found that the incident on 20 October 2003 made a material contribution to the later prolapse of a disc in Ms Barry's back; that is, that Ms Barry had suffered an injury as defined by s 4 of the SRC Act. 16 The reasons for decision do not include a finding that there was at any relevant time medical treatment in respect of Ms Barry's injury that it was reasonable for her to obtain in the circumstances (s 16).
 I see no reason to conclude that the Tribunal was not aware of its statutory obligation to include in its written reasons for decision its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based (s 43(2B)) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth)).
