 That Pursuant to Federal Magistrates Court Rule 19.02(1) the Respondent be found guilty of contempt of this Court for interfering in the due administration of justice in that it intentionally destroyed the Applicant's e-mail mailbox after it had been notified of the proposed proceedings and after it had accessed that e-mail account on or about 3 October 2002 for the purpose of its proposed defence. ... 3.
 That pursuant to Federal Magistrates Court Rule 19.02(1) the Respondent be found guilty of contempt of this Court for failing to comply with the order for discovery made by this Court on 1 July 2004 in that it did not discover the full chain of email correspondence dated 4 December 2001 variously between the Applicant and Ms Leesa Baker and then Ms Baker and Ms Hall and Ms Lindsay. ' FACTS 3 Because of the manner in which the Federal Magistrate decided the case, he did not need to set out a chronology of events.
 In response to that request, at least Ms Leesa Baker on 3 October 2002 separately forwarded three emails from the appellant's email mailbox to Mr Danny Kynaston at Mallesons. 8 On 10 December 2002 the appellant's solicitor lodged a complaint about the respondent's conduct with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC).
 I will let you know when I know something. ' 11 On 12 February 2004, after receipt of this evidence, the appellant's solicitor caused the Court to issue, inter alia, a subpoena for production which required the following documents: '1.
 All email communications to and from Leesa Baker concerning Korina Norden/Korina Choundary maintained by the Respondent's server for the period of 1 November 2000 to 29 February 2002. ' 12 On 6 May 2004, 11 June 2004 and 18 June 2004 the appellant's solicitor wrote to Mallesons about the adequacy of the respondent's compliance with the subpoena.
 In response to the subpoena seeking "all email communications to and from Stephen Byron concerning Korina Norden/Korina Choundary maintained by the Respondent's server for the period 1 November 2000 to 29 February 2002", the Respondent has failed to produce an email from Leesa Baker sent to Sarah Lindsay who forwarded it to Stephen Byron concerning why Ms Baker does not want Ms Choundary to return to work at the airport. ...' 13 On 28 June 2004 the appellant's solicitor caused the Court to issue a short service subpoena requiring the respondent to produce back-up tapes of the respondent's computer systems for the period 1 October 2001 to 31 January 2002.
 The order for discovery was in the following terms: 'On or before 15 July 2004 the respondent shall discover: (a) all emails to and from the applicant for the period 1 November 2000 to 28 February 2002; (b) all emails to and from Mr Stephen Byron concerning the applicants [sic] for the period 1 November 2000 to 28 February 2002; (c) all emails to and from Ms Leesa Baker concerning the applicant for the period 1 November 2000 to 28 February 2002. ' 15 On 15 July 2004 the respondent provided verified discovery.
 The full email chain containing six separate emails dated 4 December 2001 was not produced, although two of those six emails were produced. 28 The Federal Magistrate found that there was no prima facie case for the respondent to answer as the subpoena called for material from the server, not from the back-up tapes.
 For the purposes of rule 14.03 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) the respondent's affidavit of discovery shall distinguish between documents previously produced on subpoena and documents not previously produced. ' 35 There appear to have been two reasons why the Federal Magistrate rejected the existence of a prima facie case.
 The Federal Magistrate said: 'The clear implication is that the tape was only recently found. ' He was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the evidence that the back-up tape was in the possession, custody and control of the respondent in July 2004 and had not been lost or misplaced. 37 In my opinion, the evidence of the appellant's solicitor could not be utilised in that fashion in deciding whether or not there was a prima facie case.
