 The applicant submitted that the ICCPR contained an implicit non-refoulement obligation where as a necessary or foreseeable consequence of their removal or deportation from Australia, the person would face a real risk of violation of their rights under Art 6 (right to life) or Art 7 (freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment).
 The applicant submitted that, because the Minister had been advised through the issues paper that the applicant had "not made any claims that require[d] assessment in relation to international obligations", he had been invited to make a decision without regard to the implicit non-refoulement obligation of the ICCPR.
 The Minister submitted that even if the Court were to find that the applicant was stateless the applicant could not have had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would consider obligations arising under the CSSP because the CSSP was not one of the international instruments expressly referred to in Direction 21.
