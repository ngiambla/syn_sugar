 The applicant submitted that the Tribunal had not given consideration to the definition of torture in Art 7(2)(e) and had erred in failing to make a finding about whether the infliction of severe pain or suffering had been intentional.
 The respondent submitted that it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to expressly refer to Art 7(2)(e) as the mens rea of the crime against humanity of torture was addressed comprehensively in the EoC and in Art 30 of the Rome Statute to which the Tribunal had recourse.
 The applicant submitted that the failure by the applicant to raise the issue of the defence of superior orders based on the law existing prior to the coming in to force of the convention could have in no way prejudiced the respondent.
 The respondent submitted that there was no obligation on the Tribunal to consider a defence that was not relied upon by the applicant and that this situation was a fortiori in relation to defences said to exist not under the Rome Statute.
