 Ultimately, the Tribunal accepted that the Cyprus Women's Group exists, but due to the confused and contradictory evidence given by the appellant and her husband, the Tribunal did not accept that it is a political group, that it campaigns in elections and that its meetings were disrupted by government forces.
 The point is made that if the Tribunal found the appellant's evidence to be vague, confused and contradictory in relation to many aspects of her claim, then the Tribunal ought to have clarified the issues that were vague, confused and contradictory rather than making an adverse finding as to credibility without clarification.
 Furthermore, the Tribunal is not required to put to the appellant its disbelief in her claims: see SZAFJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 291 at [31] - [32] , WABY v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 209 at [69] and SZATB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 274 at [39] - [40] .
 His Honour distinguished SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 (" SAAP "), pointing out that SAAP was a case in which the only ground relied upon was a ground on which jurisdictional error was established.
