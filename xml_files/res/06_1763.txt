 The Product Information for the Respondent's products indicates that it is not an authorised indication for coronary artery disease (the applicant's third registered indication). 3 The respondent obtained a listing from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme effective from 1 December 2006, which required the respondent to be in an immediate position to supply the market from that date.
 The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction preventing the respondent from representing that its products were substitutable with Coversyl to treat coronary artery disease. 4 Immediately prior to the scheduled commencement of the interlocutory hearing, the respondent had communication from the Therapeutic Goods Administration that its products had been registered for the third indication.
 Therefore, the only matter for me to decide is one of costs. 5 The considerations which apply when a matter has otherwise been resolved but the parties seek an order for costs has recently been discussed by me in Oxford Funding Proprietary Limited v Oxford Asia Pacific Investments Proprietary Limited (No 2) [2006) FCA 1542 at par [5]. 6 In the present case the dispute arose in circumstances of great urgency.
