 The Product Information for the Respondent's products indicates that it is not an authorised indication for coronary artery disease (the applicant's third registered indication). 3 The respondent obtained a listing from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme effective from 1 December 2006, which required the respondent to be in an immediate position to supply the market from that date.
 The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction preventing the respondent from representing that its products were substitutable with Coversyl to treat coronary artery disease. 4 Immediately prior to the scheduled commencement of the interlocutory hearing, the respondent had communication from the Therapeutic Goods Administration that its products had been registered for the third indication.
 The Court should not be too ready to dictate in hindsight a particular course of conduct which the parties could or should have taken. 7 I think the applicant acted reasonably in initiating proceedings to forestall what was arguably, in its view, misleading and deceptive conduct by the respondent which could be seriously damaging.
