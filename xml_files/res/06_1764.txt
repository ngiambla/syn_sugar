 The Council considered that the service of the specified part of the Goldsworthy Railway Line was not a service to which Part IIIA applies, that the 'production process' exception in s 44B did apply, and therefore that the Council had no jurisdiction to further consider Fortescue's application with respect to the Goldsworthy Service. 17 The Council then proceeded to consider the application under s 44G of the Act with respect to the Mt Newman Service only.
 The former was said by Fortescue to constitute the use of the rail line and associated infrastructure, and the latter constituting the carriage of goods on the rail line. 82 The definition of 'service' in s 44B of Part IIIA of the Act specifically includes the use of an infrastructure facility such as a road or railway line.
 However, Fortescue submitted that these port operations, under which ore from some of the mines is further crushed, screened and blended and ore from other mines is blended and screened are separate production processes to those undertaken at each of the mines. 144 Applying Hamersley , I do not accept this submission.
