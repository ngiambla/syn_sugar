 The old condition 6 was repeated on five successive Online Fulfilment web pages which had to be accessed in order to buy a ticket online after the purchaser was redirected in the purchase of a ticket through the Big Day Out website.
 I am satisfied that the way in which Creative, through Ms McBeath and Mr Lees, interpreted new condition 6 is the natural and ordinary meaning of that condition which an ordinary reasonable member of the public would understand.
 A ticket holder may not have had any contract with Creative for the purchase of the ticket. 76 The admission into the venue is the consideration Creative gives for a return promise that Creative will have power to revoke the licence (condition of entry 1).
