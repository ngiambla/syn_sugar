 The Land Council owns the fee simple in the Land, subject to any native title rights or interests (s 36(9) of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW)) and wishes to sell the Land.
 A person or persons authorised by the claim group may make an application for a determination that native title exists pursuant to s 61(1), provided that person is also a member of the claim group. 35 Worimi says that, under traditional laws, the position of custodian of the Land was passed to him by his father who was an initiated Worimi man and a Worimi Elder.
 Worimi explains inconsistencies in his evidence, such as the earlier statement that the rights were held by the women and that he was only bringing the application on their behalf, by the absence of legal advice at that time.
