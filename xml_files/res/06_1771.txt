 The Tribunal was not obliged to put to the appellant the conclusions drawn from those facts or its reasoning ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S 154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 at [54] per Gummow and Heydon JJ and at [85]---[86] per Kirby J).
 It found that the looting and destruction of his business occurred not because the business was owned by a Chinese family, but in the context of a breakdown of law and order and widespread rioting affecting many shop-front businesses.
 The Tribunal said that it was not satisfied that the appellant was targeted because of his race. 41 The Minister submits that the Tribunal accepted the appellant's subjective fear arising during and subsequent to the May 1998 riots; that was not contradicted in the Tribunal's findings.
