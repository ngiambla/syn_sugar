 1 On 14 December 2006, orders were made convening a meeting of the shareholders of the publicly listed Promina Group Limited (Promina) pursuant to s 411 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to consider a scheme of arrangement providing for the acquisition of the shares in Promina by Suncorp Insurance Holdings Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the publicly listed Suncorp-Metway Limited (Suncorp).
 Suncorp's subsidiary will acquire the shares in Promina for consideration in cash and shares. 2 I am satisfied that there has been compliance with the statutory formalities. 3 I am satisfied that the structure of the scheme is effective and appropriately safeguards the interests of shareholders in the event that the scheme is approved.
 It effectively removes the performance risk to which I have referred in other cases (eg Re SFE Corporation Ltd (2006) 59 ACSR 82 ; [2006] FCA 670 ; Re Tempo Services Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 523 at 524; [2005] FCA 410). 4 I am satisfied that the proposed procedure complies with the statute and with the applicable authorities.
 It is not proposed that ineligible foreign shareholders constitute a separate class ( Re Hills Motorway Ltd (2002) 43 ACSR 101 at 104; Re SFE Corporation Ltd at [8]). 5 The exclusivity period and break fee are not such as to cause concern ( Re SFE Corporation Ltd at [7]).
