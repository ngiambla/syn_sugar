 1 On 14 December 2006, orders were made convening a meeting of the shareholders of the publicly listed Promina Group Limited (Promina) pursuant to s 411 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to consider a scheme of arrangement providing for the acquisition of the shares in Promina by Suncorp Insurance Holdings Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the publicly listed Suncorp-Metway Limited (Suncorp).
 It effectively removes the performance risk to which I have referred in other cases (eg Re SFE Corporation Ltd (2006) 59 ACSR 82 ; [2006] FCA 670 ; Re Tempo Services Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 523 at 524; [2005] FCA 410). 4 I am satisfied that the proposed procedure complies with the statute and with the applicable authorities.
 It is not proposed that ineligible foreign shareholders constitute a separate class ( Re Hills Motorway Ltd (2002) 43 ACSR 101 at 104; Re SFE Corporation Ltd at [8]). 5 The exclusivity period and break fee are not such as to cause concern ( Re SFE Corporation Ltd at [7]).
