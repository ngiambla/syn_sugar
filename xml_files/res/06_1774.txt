 1 This interlocutory application raises the question whether a liquidator's remuneration for services in a winding up by the Court should include payment for work done and reimbursement for expenses incurred in responding to requests for information by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) concerning the liquidation.
 To discharge its own responsibilities ASIC needed to know how the liquidation, a complex one involving litigation, was progressing. 30 In that setting, the provision of information by the Liquidator to ASIC about the progress of the winding up was part and parcel of the "services" which the Liquidator was authorised and required by the Winding Up Order to perform.
 The Liquidator would surely have been open to criticism if he had refused to supply any information to ASIC, or any information beyond the bare requirements of the Winding Up Order. 31 ASIC sought information about the progress of the winding up.
