 The ACCC submitted that the true nature, scope and terms of the contract, arrangement or understanding can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding a written heads of agreement between Edison and the CEPU, which was signed on behalf of Edison on 23 August 2001 ('the heads of agreement').
 The next issue is whether this provision was included in the contract, arrangement or understanding for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of preventing or hindering Edison from acquiring or continuing to acquire electrical services from a person who qualifies as a second person for the purposes of s 45E(3) of the TPA.
 The third order seeks to restrain the CEPU from counselling, procuring, inducing or attempting to induce Edison to give effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU where the provision was included for a purpose proscribed by s 45E(3).
