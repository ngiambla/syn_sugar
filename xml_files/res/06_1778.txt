 The outline of submissions accepted that the decisions and conduct of the respondent and its responsible officers at the Manjimup Town Hall booth in connection with the 2004 federal election may have been reviewable by the Federal Court under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (the Judiciary Act ).
 A declaration that if, when the applicant presents himself to vote at the Federal election for the Senate and House of Representatives to be held in 2007, the respondent provides him with electoral booths that only contain voting compartments similar to those provided at the Manjimup Town Hall in Western Australia when he voted at the last Federal election held in 2004, such booths do not lawfully comply with sections 206 and 233 of the Act ("the relevant provisions"); 4.
 It is these provisions which define the character of the liability, which is said by the applicant to be 'a continuing one' because of the dispute between the applicant and the respondent. 17 The applicant accepts that the liability which he seeks to have addressed by the Court cannot crystallise until the next election.
 If it does so, and if there is a remedy appropriate to the asserted wrong, there is, in my view, a matter for the purposes of Ch III of the Constitution . ' The Court therefore found that ss 80 and 163A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) were valid insofar as they purported to confer standing on the applicant in that case. 23 The respondent accepts that the reasoning in Croome 191 CLR and in Motorways 200 CLR broadens the concept of 'matter' as considered in re Judiciary and Navigation Acts 29 CLR.
 The structure, layout and appearance of the election booths at the next election cannot be prejudged; until a federal election day there is nothing that can found a basis for a claim that the respondent has failed to comply with the Electoral Act . 26 Expressed in other ways, the applicant in the claim in the draft application is not asserting any immediate right or duty.
