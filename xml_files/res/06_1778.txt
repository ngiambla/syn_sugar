 In [13] it is alleged the respondent has not indicated to the applicant that it intends to provide polling booths at the next federal election that are in any way different to those provided at the polling place where the applicant endeavoured to vote in the 2004 federal election.
 If s 206 arguably gives rise to a right or duty, it could only do so when Pt XVI has application to a polling; that is, after the issue of writs for an election. 27 Further, there is no continuing liability on the applicant until such time as he declines or refuses to vote at an election yet to be called.
 That is, the nature of his liability would not be known until the passage had been taken by him through these steps. 28 I am unable to accept that what the applicant regards as his 'continuing controversy' with the respondent on the form the voting booths should take to comply with s 206 , can properly be characterised as a present liability.
