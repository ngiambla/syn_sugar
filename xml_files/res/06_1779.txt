 Claims for damages for misleading or deceptive conduct were also made. 2 Energy and its subsidiary, Australian Energy Equity Pty Ltd (AEE) cross-claimed against Martech and Mr Brand by reason of a "milestone" payment made in respect of a power station development in India known as the Vypeen Combined Cycle Power Project.
 The costs order made on the cross-claim was that the cross-claimants were to pay the cross-respondents' costs of the cross-claim to be taxed if not agreed. 5 I directed that the parties to the Martech claim file written submissions as to pre-judgment interest and costs following the judgment.
 Martech submitted that the cause of action arose in respect of the judgment sum on 10 December 2001 when Mr Brand first wrote to Energy advising that Martech's forbearance had ceased.
 A calculation of the judgment sum with interest applied from those three dates was appended to the submission. 9 Energy submitted in response that Martech was unsuccessful in seven of the eight causes of action and claims.
