 Mr Bowen complains that the dam is contaminated to such an extent that it is unusable for irrigation, or for manufacturing purposes, and has been affecting his business adversely. 7 Mr Bowen attempted to obtain redress in respect of this by instituting a proceeding in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ('the Tribunal') for what is called an enforcement order.
 It cannot be misleading or deceptive conduct, or unconscionable conduct, for a party to conduct in its own interests a case in such a tribunal, to produce evidence which is then accepted by the tribunal, and to succeed in defeating a claim brought to the tribunal by another party. 12 Even if it could be said that the first two respondents, by their counsel and by their conduct of the proceedings in the Tribunal, had misled and deceived the Tribunal, or had acted unconscionably, there is a causation issue that would cause great difficulty for Mr Bowen.
 That attempt, so I am told, was unsuccessful. 13 As I have said, discussion with Mr Bowen's McKenzie friend ranged over various issues of constitutional law, the application of Imperial Acts, the power of the State Parliament to repeal Imperial Acts, the power of the State Parliament to create tribunals and to confer on them judicial and quasi-judicial power, and various such things.
