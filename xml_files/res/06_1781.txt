 His Honour was also satisfied that the way in which the proceeding had been conducted amounted to an abuse of process under O 20 r 2, such that the process was an instrument of injustice or unfairness to the respondents.
 An order for costs on a solicitor/client basis was founded upon the same findings. 3 Counsel for the applicant recognised the difficulty of upsetting an interlocutory judgment of this kind concerning matters of practice and procedure by the docket judge having an intimate knowledge of the progress of the case.
 The normal considerations to be taken into account are: (a) whether the judgment is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by a Full Court; and (b) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong ( Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Anor v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397).
 I do not regard the judge as having been concerned with technicalities or legal form but rather with the failure of the applicant to state her case in a manner which could be grappled with by the respondents and dealt with by the Court. 7 It was also submitted that the Court had not taken into account the fact that the applicant had been unrepresented until the notice of motion in question.
