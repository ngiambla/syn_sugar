 It is clear, however, that the applicant's primary complaint concerning the Departmental submissions related to their contents. 25 Counsel for the Minister submitted that the Minister was not obliged to provide the applicant with a copy of the Departmental submissions as a matter of natural justice.
 The applicant submitted on the basis of these alleged inconsistencies the affidavit was intentionally constructed to misconceive and was wholly lacking in foundation, and that Mr Fermin had no honest belief in the truth of the statements made. 32 It was not clear from the applicant's submissions how this ground was said to support the orders sought.
 In relation to the recently commenced Supreme Court proceedings, it was submitted that the Minister was expressly made aware, through the Departmental submissions, of the applicant's prior litigation against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation which dealt with the same subject matter.
