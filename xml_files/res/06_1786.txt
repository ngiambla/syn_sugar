 If amended properly, the applicant's notice of appeal could support an appeal on a question of law. 16 The respondent opposed the grant of further leave, however, substantially because the appeal, if amended to raise the jurisdictional question, was manifestly hopeless.
 The respondent submitted that before s 1317B of the Corporations Act could apply, there must be "a decision made under [the Corporations Act ]" and that the applicant had identified no such decision. 17 The applicant submitted that the respondent's submission should not be accepted because he had raised a question concerning the applicability of Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act .
 Yesterday (as it seems on earlier occasions) the applicant specifically stated that he did not rely on s 536 of the Corporations Act . 18 I am compelled to accept the respondent's submission that, even if the applicant were granted further leave to amend his notice of appeal, the question of law that he would seek to raise is bound to be determined against him.
