 The orders for payment were suspended and in lieu the applicants were ordered to perform a total of 1340 hours of unpaid community service. (As to such an appeal see Lai Ha v McCusker [2000] FCA 1173 ; (2000) 101 FCR 460).
 Subsection (5) refers to offences ' relating to infringing public performances of literary, dramatic or musical works' , subs (5AA) to ' offences relating to sound recordings or films heard or seen in public '.
 The first-mentioned offence relates to the selling or letting for hire an infringing copy of a copyright work; the second relates to a person having an infringing copy in their possession for the purpose of selling, letting for hire, distributing and the like; and the third to a person having in their possession a device used for making infringing copies. 6 The question raised by the respondent was whether the Magistrate ought to have imposed a global fine for all 21 offences.
 It appeared to me that the subsections here relevant create the offences, but if there be a ' provision ' to which they relate, it is to be found elsewhere. 8 One view, canvassed during short argument, is that there are a number of ' provisions ' in s 132, which can be seen by reference to the headings such as ' Offences relating to infringing copies '.
