 The orders for payment were suspended and in lieu the applicants were ordered to perform a total of 1340 hours of unpaid community service. (As to such an appeal see Lai Ha v McCusker [2000] FCA 1173 ; (2000) 101 FCR 460).
 The first-mentioned offence relates to the selling or letting for hire an infringing copy of a copyright work; the second relates to a person having an infringing copy in their possession for the purpose of selling, letting for hire, distributing and the like; and the third to a person having in their possession a device used for making infringing copies. 6 The question raised by the respondent was whether the Magistrate ought to have imposed a global fine for all 21 offences.
