 It was further emphasised by the Commissioner in any event that '[t]he amount of consideration which moved the sale was the receipt of the sum including the dividends and it did not matter that part was paid from the target company rather than the purchaser', and further therefore that '[t]he consideration for the transfers was not only what the purchaser gave up, but also what was agreed would be received by the vendors from the target' company.
 As I have earlier outlined, the Lend Lease case was to the effect that the FPA, though entered into on 7 June 1996, constituted a contract for the sale of the Westpac shares whereby until completion thereof on 30 April 2000, ownership of the Westpac shares would remain with Lend Lease, and would therefore not pass to County Natwest, such that Natwest would not acquire any beneficial interest in the Westpac shares prior to completion of the FPA.
 Consistently with that pricing structure undertaken by Lend Lease in favour of County Natwest was the payment of $250,000 put in place in favour of Lend Lease in return for the 'Completion Date' being later brought forward from 30 April 2000 to 17 January 2000, as I recorded in [14] above. 92 Inconsistently therefore with that pricing structure put in place by Lend Lease and County Natwest was the Commissioner's purported postulation of the so-called '[a]dditional non-cash consideration', having a supposed valuation assessed by the Commissioner at $144,236,243 attributed adversely to Lend Lease.
