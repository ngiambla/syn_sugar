 Counsel has referred me to several authorities which provide clear authority for reading the relevant section in that way, namely, Re Application of Vouris and Anor (2004) 49 ACSR 543; [2004] NSWSC 384 ; Re Wily and Anor (2003) 49 ACSR 94; [2003] NSWSC 1260 and Re McGrath and Anor (as liqs of HIH Insurance Ltd) (in liq) (2005) 54 ACSR 55; [2005] NSWSC 506.
 He will therefore be easily accessible to the second plaintiff and his staff to answer queries they may have in relation to the liquidation to ensure a smooth transition of the work. 4 It is said that there are currently no funds available for payment of liquidator's disbursements and remuneration from the assets of the company.
 Plainly enough, the proposed transfer is convenient and may achieve a result which would be difficult to achieve if there were sought to be a replacement of the first plaintiff by a liquidator with no association with him. 5 On the other hand, it is clear enough that the relationship between the two plaintiffs is such that this could not be regarded as being an arm's length replacement in any real sense.
