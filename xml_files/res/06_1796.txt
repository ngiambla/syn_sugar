 1 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Piggott Wood Baker (a firm) [2006] FCA 1774 I upheld the Liquidator's claim for remuneration for work done and expenses incurred in responding to requests by ASIC for information as to the progress of the winding up.
 The hearing was disposed of in a day. 4 The payment of the Liquidator's costs out of the Guarantee Fund is consistent with the terms of the Winding Up Order as amended and s 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 (Tas).
 Moreover, the fund derived from recovered monies is not a pooled fund and there would be great practical difficulty in apportioning the costs across individual loans. 5 Counsel for ASIC undertakes on behalf of his client not to seek or otherwise procure payment of costs.
