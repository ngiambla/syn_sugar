 A joint submission was put to the Court about injunctive relief and the Court made an injunction for three years. 10 The Commission uses the orders against Liquorland as a foundation for a submission that a significantly higher penalty should be imposed upon Woolworths.
 It was of relevant commercial significance to Woolworths and should be viewed in that light. 16 Woolworths also placed great emphasis, as it did in the earlier hearing, upon the relationship between the conduct and the working of the Liquor Act .
 If the protocol that has been in place for some time by Woolworths has been followed and can be expected to be followed there is a strong basis to argue, as Woolworths does, that the injunction is unnecessary.
