 In other words, a notice given under par (a) can be expressed to have an ambulatory or ongoing operation and to require the recipient to pay not only tax that is already due and payable, but tax which may become due and payable in the future, and will do so if the non-resident derives further income.
 While the notice might remain dormant until such time as ANZ Nominees has the receipt, control or disposal of money belonging to ECMI, if and when that occurs the provisions of subs 255(1) will be activated and pars (b), (c) and (d), in particular, will be triggered. 92 The Deputy Commissioner contended that upon payment of the sum of $9,953,426.10 by Healthscope to ANZ Nominees, it would be required by s 255 to retain that sum. 93 The submission proceeds on the basis that by reason of the agreement referred to in [77] supra, the withheld sum of $9,953,426.10 received by ANZ Nominees, belongs to ECMI.
 The Other Grounds of Challenge 96 The notices issued in reliance on s 255 of the ITAA 1936 were impugned on a number of other grounds which should be addressed, even if only for completeness. 97 The 8 November 2004 Notice was also impugned on the additional grounds that: (1) If Healthscope did have the 'receipt control or disposal of money belonging to a non-resident', the non-resident was not ECMI .
 In my view, the fact that at the time of the issue of a notice under subs 255(1)(a) a notice of assessment had not issued or, had issued but was not a valid assessment, with the consequence that no tax was due and payable by the non-resident at the time of the issue of the s 255(1)(a) notice, is not a bar to its validity as a notice.
