 The Other Grounds of Challenge 96 The notices issued in reliance on s 255 of the ITAA 1936 were impugned on a number of other grounds which should be addressed, even if only for completeness. 97 The 8 November 2004 Notice was also impugned on the additional grounds that: (1) If Healthscope did have the 'receipt control or disposal of money belonging to a non-resident', the non-resident was not ECMI .
 In my view, the fact that at the time of the issue of a notice under subs 255(1)(a) a notice of assessment had not issued or, had issued but was not a valid assessment, with the consequence that no tax was due and payable by the non-resident at the time of the issue of the s 255(1)(a) notice, is not a bar to its validity as a notice.
