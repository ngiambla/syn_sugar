 1 Prestige Property Services Pty Limited ("Prestige") seeks a stay of orders of Gray J made 23 January 2006, requiring, amongst others things, that it pay to the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union ("the Union") certain penalties and that it make payments to some 27 of its employees following underpayment in breach of awards.
 It is sufficient for the respondent to demonstrate that there is a reason or it is an appropriate case to warrant the exercise of the discretion: see Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp (1996) 67 FCR 65 at 66. 6 The prima facie assumption is that the judgment appealed from is correct and the Court should not deprive a litigant of the benefit of a judgment in its favour.
 There was a real risk, so counsel submitted, that the appeal would be rendered nugatory by the fact that monies could not be recovered if the appeal were successful. 10 Notwithstanding Ms Chester's statements about what she had been told by the employees, I accept that, as the appellant has submitted, it is likely that Prestige will find it difficult to recover at least some of the monies paid to the 27 individual employees should its appeal succeed.
