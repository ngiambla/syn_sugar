 There are three principal areas of dispute in relation to Jarra's proposed orders. 2 The first question is whether the respondents should be ordered to file and serve an affidavit deposing as to what records are kept and the way in which such records are made and retained by them.
 Due to the overlap of legal and factual matters with the ACCC proceeding, I consider that the information called for under that Protocol should be disclosed and, subject to claims of privilege and confidentiality, those documents can be inspected.
