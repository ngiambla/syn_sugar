 There are three principal areas of dispute in relation to Jarra's proposed orders. 2 The first question is whether the respondents should be ordered to file and serve an affidavit deposing as to what records are kept and the way in which such records are made and retained by them.
 It is also submitted that these figures are exclusive of the costs of examining the documents for the purpose of obtaining legal advice as to discoverability and issues such as privilege. 11 Furthermore, there is a dispute as to extent and number of fields relating to meta-data that it is appropriate to provide at this early stage of the proceeding.
 The word "document" is broadly defined in the Federal Court Rules to include documents encompassed by the definition of "document" in the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), as well as any material data or information stored or recorded by mechanical or electronic means: see O 1 r 4.
 Due to the overlap of legal and factual matters with the ACCC proceeding, I consider that the information called for under that Protocol should be disclosed and, subject to claims of privilege and confidentiality, those documents can be inspected.
