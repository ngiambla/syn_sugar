 The application for review was therefore dismissed as incompetent and the first applicant was ordered to pay the costs of the Minister. 6 On this appeal, it is submitted by the applicants that the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the application for review was incompetent.
 On this basis, counsel submits that the Court is not deprived of jurisdiction by reason of s 477 in this case. 7 It is accepted by counsel that there is authority for the proposition that the specified time limit of 28 days can go to the issue of jurisdiction.
 Since the provision has not been complied with, the Federal Magistrate was correct in holding that there was no jurisdiction in this case. 12 The second argument advanced by counsel for the applicants is that s 477 is a privative clause and should be read strictly so as not to oust the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. 13 In my opinion, s 477 does not oust the jurisdiction of the Court.
