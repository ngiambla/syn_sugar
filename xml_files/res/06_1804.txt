 The Agreement also provided for sale of the equipment in circumstances where Capital Finance would agree to sell the equipment to LSE and LSE would agree to purchase it from Capital Finance on the "sale date" for the sale price.
 On 15 December 2000, an unrelated company known as Leasetec Australia Pty Ltd obtained orders against LSE and its principal, Mr Lloyd Scott, in the form of a preservation order restraining LSE from dealing with assets up to an amount of approximately $3.61 million.
 It is contended by the Capital companies that Clause 4 requires LSE to incur an obligation to reduce of the exposure of the Capital companies under the lease arrangements previously existing in accordance with the P A Agreements between LSE and the respective Capital companies.
 This Memo also notes that at meeting of 11 January 2001, a final deal was brokered where a verbal undertaking was given by Capital Finance and Leasetec that they would not pursue prosecution of LSE or Mr Scott if the arrangements relating to the payouts were adhered to.
