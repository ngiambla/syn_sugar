 On 15 December 2000, an unrelated company known as Leasetec Australia Pty Ltd obtained orders against LSE and its principal, Mr Lloyd Scott, in the form of a preservation order restraining LSE from dealing with assets up to an amount of approximately $3.61 million.
 It is contended by the Capital companies that Clause 4 requires LSE to incur an obligation to reduce of the exposure of the Capital companies under the lease arrangements previously existing in accordance with the P A Agreements between LSE and the respective Capital companies.
