 The second (the minimum environmental condition representation) was that '[WPC] would only consider tenders that satisfied the minimum environmental conditions specified in the tender documents'. 13 As his Honour expressed it, in simple terms Griffin said that WPC called for tenders for a 300 MW to 330 MW baseload plant which was required to meet prescribed environmental standards.
 Secondly, the evidence does not address the apparent conflict between the respondent's stated requirement in the bid information, of the plant's high availability, which Mr Trumble said was in the order of 90 per cent, and the 'capacity factor' referred to of 75 per cent to 80 per cent.
 It is submitted that if the words were given that meaning, his Honour would have been bound to conclude that all the bidders had to do was 'strive to meet or exceed' the levels of environmental performance described therein and there was no evidence before the Court that Wambo did not meet that requirement, so understood. 48 I do not agree with the submission by ERC that the words of this alleged misrepresentation are expressive only of a 'plain meaning'.
