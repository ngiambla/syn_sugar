 It is clear, at least on the evidence before me, that a psychiatric assessment was given by Dr Entwisle to Lander and Rogers Lawyers, solicitors for Moorfields Community, who was the first defendant in the proceeding brought by Ms Bahonko in the County Court of Victoria. 7 At this stage in the course of giving reasons for decision the applicant sought to file an affidavit of her own sworn on 20 December 2006.
 I have rejected already the preliminary matters that were raised prior to the affidavit now being filed on behalf of the applicant sworn this day. 9 It seems to me, having regard to that affidavit, and having regard to the fact that this is an application which is being brought by the applicant in person, that it would be dangerous and unwise for this Court to rely upon Dr Entwisle's report for the purposes of making any determination under s 66 of the Act.
 In the normal course of events an application like this may well involve other evidence, cross-examination and matters of that kind that may go to whether or not the Court considers that a party may need to have a guardian or administrator, or both, appointed under the Act. 10 So how I intend to proceed is not to rely upon Dr Entwisle's report for the purposes of these proceedings. 11 I should indicate that it has been submitted that, by operation of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (' Judiciary Act '), a state statute is rendered applicable in a court exercising federal jurisdiction in the circumstances of this particular case.
