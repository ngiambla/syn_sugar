 On 12 December 2006 the principal Registrar of the County Court lodged an application with VCAT pursuant to the order made by his Honour Judge Coish of the County Court of Victoria. 2 The first respondent seeks orders set out in the notice of motion filed 13 December 2006 and relies on the following affidavits in support: the affidavit of Dr Entwisle affirmed on 12 December 2006, which exhibits his report dated 5 December 2006 to Lander Rogers, which was relied upon before the County Court of Victoria; the affidavit of Phillipa Regein Davey affirmed on 13 December 2006, which exhibits the relevant transcript and orders of the County Court made on 6 December 2006; and the affidavit of Phillipa Regein Davey affirmed on 18 December 2006, which exhibits the application made to VCAT.
 I indicated at the outset I did not accept that submission and indicated that I would proceed to hear the motion on its merits. 4 The fact that there is under consideration a motion from the applicant considering the removal of certain legal representatives of the first respondent does not mean the present motion by the first respondent could not be brought by the legal representatives still on the record, and in particular, of course, the issue arises because after the hearing of that matter concerning legal representation, on 6 December an order was made by the County Court which is the subject of this present motion.
 It seems to me that in this particular case Dr Entwisle is giving evidence which he is entitled to give as if he was called to give viva voce evidence in relation to the matter that he is providing evidence about, namely the psychiatric assessment of the applicant. 6 In addition I have no basis for believing, and no evidence has been produced by the applicant in these proceedings before me, as to there being a breach of confidentiality.
 It is clear, at least on the evidence before me, that a psychiatric assessment was given by Dr Entwisle to Lander and Rogers Lawyers, solicitors for Moorfields Community, who was the first defendant in the proceeding brought by Ms Bahonko in the County Court of Victoria. 7 At this stage in the course of giving reasons for decision the applicant sought to file an affidavit of her own sworn on 20 December 2006.
