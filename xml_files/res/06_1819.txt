 That includes, without limitation as to its generality, a specific power to make regulations: 'making provision for matters that, under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 , are required or permitted to be prescribed in regulations made under this Act'. (s 504(1)(1)) 32 The applicant submits that, by reason of s 41 of the Act, the specification of visa conditions can only be done by the making of regulations and that there is no legislative intent that this power be delegated from the Governor-General to another person.
 The applicant was thereby deprived of the opportunity of not responding to the Notice, awaiting the automatic cancellation of her visa and then applying to the Minister under s 137K of the Act, where exceptional circumstances can be taken into consideration (s 137L(1)(b)).
 The Notice is misleading for the reasons given in Morsed at [22]---[25]. 52 Mr Gormly adopts the characterisation of the defects in the s 20 notice in Morsed and relies upon the denial of procedural fairness resulting from that notice with its attendant effect on the opportunity for the applicant to rely on exceptional circumstances to avoid cancellation of her visa.
