 The fact that such a review cured, in a legal sense, any defect in the hearing before the Delegate attributable to a denial of natural justice is now settled ( Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344; Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 218 ; (2005) 149 FCR 1 (special leave to appeal refused); Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 ; (2006) 149 FCR 558 at [30] ; Cheng v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1028 at [67] ).
 The Explanatory Memorandum also states that the section ' puts beyond doubt the validity of such regulations made before the commencement of [the proposed s 182]'. 22 I accept that s 505 refers to the Minister's decision whether an applicant for a visa satisfies the criterion and not whether an existing visa holder satisfies the criterion.
 It follows that the Act provides for the power to make regulations to impose conditions on, and prescribe criteria for, visas or visas of a specified class. 31 Section 504 of the Act provides that the Governor-General may make regulations not inconsistent with the Act.
 Further, as a matter of reality, an academic result that, for a specified course, is "at least satisfactory" is limited ' by an intelligible boundary ' and is not legislative in character (cf Turner at [389]). 38 Section 505, which refers specifically to such matters for visa applicants, does not delegate the whole of power to decide whether an applicant for a visa satisfies the relevant criterion.
