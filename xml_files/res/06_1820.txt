 That is not however relevant, in my view, to the applicants' case as I have explained. 52 The localised metal dusting on reactor tubes of a different design discovered in 2004 cannot impact upon the central allegations in the case namely whether it was represented that the Plant had operated for a period of five years successfully; that all of the proven attributes of the GHR had been included in the AGHR which was thereby a successful and proven technology, and that there was no significant risk of metal dusting utilising that technology.
 Neither is it relevant to issues of reliance, causation or damages. 53 As the respondents in paragraph 9 of their outline of submissions contend, and I accept, the asserted connection of the subsequent metal dusting which occurred in or about 2004 and which is referred to in paragraph 11 of the respondents' outline of submissions is not relevant to any issue in the case.
 This is despite a written request from the applicants' solicitors by letter dated 29 November 2006 ("SLF-16" to the affidavit of Mr Freire (Vol 2)). 55 In a further letter from the applicants' solicitors the following day, 30 November 2006, it was reiterated that despite having the applicants' technical expert reports since August 2005 it was only on 21 November 2006 that the respondents suggested through their solicitors that the applicants had failed in their obligation to provide discovery in relation to the current status of the technology or on-going research and development processes.
