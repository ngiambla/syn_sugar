 He relied for his application on an affidavit of Mr Sobey's solicitor sworn on 21 November 2006 to which was annexed a report dated 20 November 2006 of Dr Wright, who is an occupational physician treating Mr Sobey. 10 The report and other medical evidence shows that Mr Sobey underwent surgery in August 2006 and complications developed.
 In refusing the adjournment his Honour had regard to the history and the delay by Mr Sobey in the institution of any proceedings and in relation to Mr Sobey's refusal or neglect in complying with any directions.
 I am not satisfied that anything has been put that would suggest that the trial Judge erred in relation to the exercising of a discretion in refusing the adjournment. 17 As to the second ground, likewise, I am not satisfied that the ground is arguable.
 The evidence before the trial Judge which he has detailed in his reasons, coupled with the absence of evidence from Mr Sobey, clearly indicated that there were serious inconsistencies in the claim brought by Mr Sobey.
