 As I have said, on 4 June 2004 Evajade Pty Ltd replaced Mr and Mrs Garrett as trustees of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust and on the same day that company also replaced Mr and Mrs Garrett as trustees of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 2. 5 A dispute arose as to who was entitled to what has been described as the income stream generated by the settlement deed.
 On 11 November 2005 Evajade Pty Ltd assigned to Mr Garrett, as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3, the same debt which had been assigned to it as trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 1, being the Berringer Blass debt. 10 The other matter of significance is that on 27 January 2006 Mr Garrett was appointed co-trustee with Evajade Pty Ltd of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust and the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 2.
 This is another instance of the type of activity which has been generated in proceedings in this Court over the last 18 months or so. 14 Mr Garrett therefore seeks to be joined in these proceedings as the trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3.
