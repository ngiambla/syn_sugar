 1 The factual context of, and the general legal issues arising out of, Mr Clarkson's complaints about the failure to investigate the circumstances of his incarceration as a federal offender in a State prison have been outlined in my judgment in Clarkson v Commonwealth of Australia [2006] FCA 1348. 2 I have already dismissed his claims against four of the six respondents.
 The decision made not to investigate the failure of the Commonwealth to amend the 1990 Commonwealth/State NSW Agreement to include terms designed ensure compliance with the ICCPR Protocols and otherwise according to law. " 4 The Ombudsman first objected to the competency of the application against him on procedural grounds.
 In light of the reasoning in my previous judgment, Mr Clarkson in effect concedes that this application will also be dismissed, I having previously held that the relevant officials and/or employees of the sixth respondent are not officers of the Commonwealth with the consequence that an essential pre-condition of attracting the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to review their actions cannot be made out. 5 In correspondence with Mr Clarkson the Ombudsman has repeatedly indicated his lack of jurisdiction to investigate complaints relating to State Government departments.
