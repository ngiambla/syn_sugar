 Since November 2005 the applicant has been aware that certain stalls at the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne were selling t-shirts which had not been supplied by the applicant but which bore the pictures for which the applicant held exclusive licence.
 The applicant obtained the names and addresses of the stall holders and, in December 2005, sent letters to those stall holders asserting that they had infringed the applicant's copyright in relation to the pictures and contravened provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
 The applicant sought advice as to the names and addresses of the manufacturers and importers of the infringing t-shirts, the quantity involved and the price for which the t-shirts were purchased and sold.
 The pictures appearing on t-shirts being sold by the defendants appear to be identical with those commissioned by the applicant. 9 The evidence does not, however, satisfy me that the other two preconditions have been satisfied.
