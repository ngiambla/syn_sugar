 The expression 'asbestos related claim' is defined to mean a claim concerning asbestos exposure resulting from the claimant's employment by Stork ICM, the provision of services to Stork ICM (each, an 'Exposed Person'), or any indirect exposure of a person to an Exposed Person.
 Accordingly, these amounts are not liabilities that will be transferred to Stork FSA under the Scheme. 32 There are in evidence letters of comfort from Stork NV to the directors of both Stork ICM and Stork FSA, undertaking to provide necessary financial support to enable the relevant company to pay all its debts as and when they become due.
 The letter advised of the proposed Scheme, and expressed Stork ICM's opinion that its right of indemnity was capable of being transferred to Stork FSA under the Scheme, so that, upon implementation of the Scheme Stork FSA would have the right of indemnity that Stork ICM currently enjoyed.
 It must be immaterial to an insurer whether Stork FSA or Stork ICM refers on to it claims brought by the potential claimants in respect of circumstances, all of which occurred prior to the sale of Stork ICM's business in 2003. 109 The substitution of a different entity as the insured is itself immaterial.
