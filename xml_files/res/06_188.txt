 As recorded by the Tribunal and evident from the transcript of the proceedings, the appellant was ' asked to provide examples of how her parents were persecuted ' and ' how she was persecuted at school ' and did so.
 She had already answered the Tribunal's questions asking for examples of the persecution experienced by her parents, the discrimination and harassment claimed for reason of religion, her ability to attend church and her persecution because of religion and race.
 Failure to do so constitutes jurisdictional error. 40 The Tribunal did proceed to consider aspects of offences against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia since the appellant left Indonesia and as at the Tribunal decision but it is not clear to me whether the Tribunal included in its analysis the "criminal offences" that it had concluded were not racially based.
