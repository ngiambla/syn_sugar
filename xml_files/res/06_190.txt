 1 This proceeding is set down for trial from 20 March until 27 March 2006. 2 On 6 October 2005, consent orders were made dealing with pre-trial steps which included an order that the Applicant was to file and serve the statements of all lay witnesses and any expert reports upon which it intended to rely at trial no later than four weeks after completion of inspection of discovered documents.
 The report by Mr Michael Gould was filed and served on the Respondent on 27 February 2006. 5 As a result of further consideration of the Applicant's case, the Applicant advised the Respondent that it would seek to amend the Statement of Claim by deleting reference to 17 of the 19 drawings upon which it would rely and introduce into the action five new drawings as the foundation for the source of its copyright said to have been infringed by the Respondent.
 The action now proceeds on the basis of seven drawings as the source of those rights. 6 The Respondent says that it has received the report of the expert (which is the second report) late, the report is complicated and difficult to read, the report and the application for leave to amend the Statement of Claim restructures the formulation of the case in a fundamental way, the Applicant now contends that all versions of the Respondent's 4-in-1 bucket are said to infringe the copyright in the Applicant's plans whereas the action as previously formulated seemed to focus upon a comparison between indirect copying of the Applicant's 4-in-1 bucket by a particular bucket made and manufactured by the Respondent.
 Although I am most reluctant to vacate the dates, it seems to me in the face of the affidavit from Mr Philp and the observations of Counsel for the Respondent that the dates will need to be vacated. 11 I propose to discuss with Counsel possible dates including commencing the hearing on 27 March rather than 20 March or alternatively, Monday 3 April.
