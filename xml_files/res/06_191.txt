 Mr Coggin had insured the vessel for $150,000 and had a valuation dated 30 September 1999 from Petit Carlson Pty Ltd "for insurance purposes only" for $210,000. 6 Mr Coggin had leased the vessel for $4,000 per month to a Mr Michael Banner-Smith.
 Mr Coggin told Mr Nagy however that he wanted the transaction to be in his name, or alternatively in his daughter's name, until such time as he got the vessel back. 16 Mr Nagy and Mr Pavia moved Mr Coggin to a motel and looked after him.
 Mr Coggin was later told by Mr Nagy that this application was unsuccessful. 18 Mr Coggin's version has his involvement with Easy Drink not commencing until after Mr Nagy arrived in Brisbane to recover the Lady Christina .
 Mr Nagy says that "David Coggin was keen to pursue the Easy Drink franchise with me for Victoria and to this end I travelled to Redcliffe Queensland where he had information that his boat was being moored".
