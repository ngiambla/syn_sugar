 Mr Knight gives particulars of his reputation overseas and in Australia, and concludes that he has a valuable and substantial reputation in Australia and elsewhere in the name and mark 'MYTHBUSTERS'. 12 Mr Knight promoted in Australia and elsewhere, including to Beyond, the concept of a series of half-hour television programs to be called 'MYTHBUSTERS'. 13 Without Mr Knight's authority, Beyond has produced, promoted and distributed a television series concerning the investigation of myths entitled 'MYTHBUSTERS'.
 In addition, Beyond has licensed, authorised or permitted Discovery, SBS and Foxtel to broadcast and promote, or to procure the broadcasting and promotion of, the series in Australia and elsewhere, and they have in fact done so. 14 Mr Knight asserts that the conduct described has given rise to various misrepresentations in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the TP Act') and to various forms of passing off, by Beyond, Discovery, SBS and Foxtel. 15 The motion to join S S and Wiley arises from the alleged publication by them in Australia and elsewhere without his authority of two books which include the word 'MYTHBUSTERS' in their titles: in S S's case the book, Mythbusters: the Explosive Truth Behind 30 of the Most Perplexing Urban Legends of All Time ('the S S book'), and in Wiley's case the book Mythbusters: Don't try this at home ('the Wiley book'). 16 Mr Knight claims that by doing so, S S and Wiley have also made misrepresentations in contravention of s 52 of the TP Act and engaged in various forms of passing off. 17 Mr Knight became aware of the publication of the two books in about mid to late 2005.
 The evidentiary fields which would be covered by Mr Knight's claim against Beyond, Discovery, SBS and Foxtel in connection with the television series, and that covered by his claim against S S and Wiley in connection with publication of the two books, would, it seems, be quite different. 30 The inconvenience to the two groups of respondents of having to participate in a hearing in which a substantial number of the issues and a substantial part of the evidence would be no concern of theirs, must be weighed against the inconvenience to Mr Knight of having to prove his reputation (or reputations) in separate proceedings. 31 In my view, the weighing exercise favours the respondents.
