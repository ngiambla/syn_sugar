 This impermissibly skewed the preliminary random sample results. (the third error) (h) [The Committee] had regard to 30 services of [Dr Mathews] in each MBS Item class purportedly as an "exploratory sample" within the meaning of that expression in section 8(a) of the Sampling Determination (the report para 46). (i) [The Committee] failed to examine samples "randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample" within the meaning of that expression in section 8(a) of the Sampling Determination. [The Committee] merely examined the first 30 services from a list of services earlier generated by [HIC] at the request of the [Director] .
 In response to Professor Nicholls, Dr Stevenson said: 'Had the Committee, in following section 6 of the Determination, ensured that the preliminary random sample was a random sample and, in doing so by independently selecting a sample of 99 records randomly from a sampling frame of 8,947 records then, it might be argued from a statistical point of view that to insist the exploratory sample of 30 be further selected randomly is redundant.
 It is said that the Committee examined 30 services in each MBS item of service under review from a list of 40 services provided to the Committee by the Director and that the examined services had already been examined by the Director or by servants, officers or agents on his behalf and had been found to be deficient or sufficiently deficient in relevant respects and adverse to Dr Mathews such as to cause the Director to set up a Committee and refer the matter to it by way of Adjudicative Referral pursuant to s 93 of the Act.
