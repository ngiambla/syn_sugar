 Mr Mates told Mr Goss that he wanted the former employees of Melbourne Transit to be re-employed on the project, but Mr Goss replied that this would not be economically possible because the size of the required workforce was unknown at that stage.
 Mr Palmer said that Mr Goss had stated that TJV now employs 23 employees and that this number of employees was the only way that the job could be continued, and that he could not re-employ all of the employees that were previously employed on the site.
 Mr McMahon also deposed that a representative of Independent Cranes told him that "he was removing the crane ... [and] if he did not follow instructions, Independent Cranes would not be able to work on other sites".
