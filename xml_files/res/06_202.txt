 This conversation was followed by a letter from the trustee to the appellant on 7 July 1999, asking the appellant to address the issues raised in the trustee's letter of 15 February 1999, and informing the appellant that, as the Official Receiver had not accepted the 1998 Statement of Affairs in the form executed by the appellant, the three year period of the bankruptcy had yet to commence.
 The trustees responded to ITSA on 8 May 2001, including summarising the history of correspondence between the trustees and the appellant, and informing ITSA that the trustees continued to hold an incomplete copy of the statement of affairs (namely, the 1998 Statement of Affairs). 23 On 20 July 2004, the trustees wrote to ITSA informing ITSA that the trustees had been unable to obtain a completed statement of affairs from the bankrupt.
 The trustees requested ITSA to execute a Notice pursuant to s 77C(1) Bankruptcy Act to be issued to the appellant, requiring the appellant to attend before the Official Receiver and produce, inter alia , a completed statement of affairs. 24 A Notice executed pursuant to s 77C(1) Bankruptcy Act was executed by the Deputy Official Receiver on 29 July 2004, requiring the appellant to appear for examination at the offices of the trustees on 17 August 2004.
