 During the course of the attendance, Mr Joiner delivered to the appellant a bundle of documents including: (a) a Notice informing the appellant that (i) he had been made bankrupt by a sequestration order on 2 September 1998; (ii) Messrs Jefferson and Stevenson were the trustees of his bankrupt estate; (iii) within 14 days he was required to make out and file a statement of affairs, a copy of which was enclosed with the Notice, with the Official Receiver and to furnish the trustees with a copy of the statement; (iv) the term of his bankruptcy would commence once the duly completed statement of affairs was lodged with the Official Receiver.
 This conversation was followed by a letter from the trustee to the appellant on 7 July 1999, asking the appellant to address the issues raised in the trustee's letter of 15 February 1999, and informing the appellant that, as the Official Receiver had not accepted the 1998 Statement of Affairs in the form executed by the appellant, the three year period of the bankruptcy had yet to commence.
 A short telephone conversation took place between Mr Joiner and the appellant on 9 July 1999 where it appears that the appellant was verbally abusive of Mr Joiner. 21 The trustees wrote again to the appellant at his Gumdale postal address on 30 March 2000, requesting written responses to the information sought in the letters of 15 February 1999 and 7 July 1999, seeking information about earnings of the appellant, and reminding the appellant that, as he had not yet provided a properly completed statement of affairs, the three year period of bankruptcy had not yet commenced.
