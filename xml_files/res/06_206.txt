 The interim injunction is sought to restrain the respondent from taking any further steps in relation to the certification of an agreement made between it and the members of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association that purports to cover members, or those eligible to be members of the applicant. 2 The application was listed for first directions on 8 March 2006 and is the first time the parties have been to Court.
 It relies essentially on three circumstances. 4 The first is that the application and the affidavit of urgency were not served on it until 1 or 2 March 2006 and by that time the subject of the urgent application for interlocutory relief, namely, the prevention of certification of the agreement referred to under that claim, had been foreclosed by the agreement in fact being certified.
 The consequence of that is that I proceed on the basis the applicant had in mind that its application and the urgency of the interlocutory claim remained viable at all times. 7 In any event, there is, in my view, a statutory obstacle to any costs order being made in favour of the respondent.
