 The evidence before me reveals that somewhere in the order of just over $30,000 including penalties and interest, was due to the State Debt Recovery Office and outstanding at the time that the applicant signed the forms. 6 There is evidence before me which I accept, that the applicant considers on a basis that appears to me to be reasonable, that the State of New South Wales, through the Roads and Traffic Authority or some other instrumentality owes an offsetting amount, perhaps not in the same sum, in respect of the cancelled registrations of vehicles that had been registered in Aluform's name and that some reduction in the outstanding debt should be given in respect of that.
 One matter to be considered will be the assessment of any risks to those persons or to the public which may appear to be involved in the applicants assuming positions on the board or in management' 10 In this case, the two offences I have described appeared to me, as they did to both the applicant and the Chief Judge of the District Court, to differ in character.
