 The two circumstances relied on in support of the convictions were, first, that the form seeking the deregistration of the company, Aluform Express Pty Ltd ('Aluform') asserted that that company had no outstanding legal liabilities and, secondly, that that company was not a party to any legal proceedings. 5 The falsity of the first of those statements consisted in the fact that there were debts owed to the New South Wales State Debt Recovery Office in respect of outstanding parking and other motoring offences committed by drivers of various vehicles which were registered in the name of Aluform but operated in the overall business structure of the Transtar Group.
 The evidence before me reveals that somewhere in the order of just over $30,000 including penalties and interest, was due to the State Debt Recovery Office and outstanding at the time that the applicant signed the forms. 6 There is evidence before me which I accept, that the applicant considers on a basis that appears to me to be reasonable, that the State of New South Wales, through the Roads and Traffic Authority or some other instrumentality owes an offsetting amount, perhaps not in the same sum, in respect of the cancelled registrations of vehicles that had been registered in Aluform's name and that some reduction in the outstanding debt should be given in respect of that.
 One matter to be considered will be the assessment of any risks to those persons or to the public which may appear to be involved in the applicants assuming positions on the board or in management' 10 In this case, the two offences I have described appeared to me, as they did to both the applicant and the Chief Judge of the District Court, to differ in character.
