 Accordingly, it invited him to attend a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence in support of his claims. 5 On 17 May 1999 the Appellant appeared at a hearing of the Tribunal which lasted for a little over an hour. 6 On 31 May 1999 the Tribunal handed down its decision which was to affirm the Minister's delegate's decision not to grant a Protection Visa to the Appellant.
 Ground 2 The Federal Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error in that it used wrong test in (a) deciding whether the state protection is available for the Applicant in India (b) deciding that it is reasonable for the Applicant to relocate in India' 12 Section 45(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') makes provision for non-citizens to apply for visas of particular classes.
 However, the Tribunal's finding that the Appellant's fear of persecution was not well-founded is really addressed in two stages and one cannot disregard the importance of the finding in the following paragraph that there were areas of India where caste discrimination was not so prevalent as in Maharashtra and 'where State protection would be available'.
 The fact that there may be parts of India where caste discrimination or community based discrimination is not as bad as it is in other areas does not allow a conclusion that in the 'better' areas a fear of persecution for reason of race or membership of a particular social group could be said to be other than well-founded. 28 True it is that where internal protection is available there is no need for asylum abroad.
