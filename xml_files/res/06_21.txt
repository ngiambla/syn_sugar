 1 On 21 December 2001 I ordered that the application brought by the applicant ("the Commission") against the first respondent ("Safeway") and the third respondent ("Mr Jones") for contraventions of various provisions under Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") be dismissed: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 3) [2001] FCA 1861 ; (2001) 119 FCR 1.
 In any event general deterrence cannot be disregarded especially having regard to Safeway's size and relative position as a purchaser in the wholesale market and as a seller in the retail food market. 25 The Commission is correct in submitting that even if Safeway is unlikely to participate in similar conduct again, one of the main objectives of penalties is general deterrence.
 Having regard to all of the factors explored above, and having particular regard to the seriousness, deliberateness, and recurring nature of the four s 46 contraventions and their effect on the competitive process, and the relevant periods of deletion of bread products, I consider that the penalties imposed on Safeway ought to be substantial and reflective of the need, in particular, for general deterrence.
