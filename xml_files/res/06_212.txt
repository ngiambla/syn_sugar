 Mr Buckby expressed his reasons as being that Culley had already entered into a contract for the purchase of the 15 units thereby indicating a willingness to commit to a contract and because the Culley interests had been in regular communication with him and his representatives since at least 27 March 2000.
 As the form of the letter dated 5 May 2000 reveals, negotiations concerning the purchase of the 49 units by IHL were seen by those involved as negotiations which might lead to the settlement of the legal proceeding instituted by IHL against the Bank and Deangrove.
