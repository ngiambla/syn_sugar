 That is a matter for taxation. 27 Accordingly, I propose that the ThoughtWeb Companies should pay or provide for the payment of a total amount of $180,000.00 by way of security for costs of the Employees and Dalsix in such tranches as agreed or, in default of agreement, as ordered by the Court. 28 On the other hand, the motion by the English respondents is brought in a more difficult context.
 This motion has been 'tainted' from the outset by orders made on 23 December 2004, by consent, tying certain undertakings of TFL, one of the English respondents, including an undertaking to provide interim security for the costs of any of the ThoughtWeb Companies and ThoughtWeb Inc in respect of the First Cross-Claim in the sum of $A40,000.00, to compliance with an undertaking by ThoughtWeb to deposit with Deloittes certain information to be held in escrow pending the agreement of the parties or further order of the Court ('the par 2.3 undertaking').
 To pay all royalties and fees payable to ThoughtWeb by TFL as if the IBPA and the MPA were on foot; and 2. to provide interim security for the costs of any of the ThoughtWeb Companies and ThoughtWeb Inc in respect of the First Cross-Claim in the sum of $A40,000.00, until it is satisfied that the par 2.3 undertaking has been complied with. 30 It is not surprising then that the applicants submit that if any order is to be made against them to provide security for costs to the fifth to seventh respondents, it should be tied, as to amount and/or form, to the conditional obligations of the fifth to seventh respondents arising out of the consent orders made on 24 December 2004.
