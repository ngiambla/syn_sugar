 Bearing in mind the evidence presented as to costs and the purpose to be served by the bond, I stated that, for these reasons, I would not dismiss the application before giving the applicants an opportunity to adduce further evidence as to the precise quantum of the Commonwealth's loss.
 Accordingly, I adjourned the further hearing of the proceeding in order that the Commonwealth might have this opportunity, and I made directions to prepare the matter for further hearing if this were necessary. 3 The respondents subsequently filed motions seeking leave to appeal.
 The exhibits to the supporting affidavits revealed that, in the correspondence before the hearing on 20 September 2004 ("the first hearing"), the applicants had specifically declined the respondents' request to quantify their loss upon the basis that the costs incurred by the Commonwealth were irrelevant to the applicants' entitlement and, in any case, these costs could not be quantified.
