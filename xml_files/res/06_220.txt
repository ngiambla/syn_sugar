 The RRT did not believe the appellant's claim that police had visited her home or written to her asking her to attend at the police station in respect of the theft from her workplace.
 In particular, the FMC regarded the RRT's finding that the questioning of the appellant by the police was not related to her race, religion or political opinion as 'a significant finding in this matter'.
 It may be that it is unlikely that the police, arresting a person of the applicant's background...would refer to her race, religion or support of a political party but, nevertheless, a reference to those issues by the Tribunal does not itself constitute, in my view, an error of law.
