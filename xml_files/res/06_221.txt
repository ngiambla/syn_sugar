 Paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim 27 Paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim alleges that the Audit Team gathered and copied records subsequent to the events referred to in para 10. 28 The Respondent submits that they whilst it is aware of what records it says it copied, it does not know whether the Applicant alleges that it took any further material.
 Paragraph 18 of the Statement of Claim 41 Paragraph 18 of the Statement of Claim alleges that after the Audit Team collected records at the request of the Respondent on 25 and 26 October 2004, a report (dated 21 April 2005) was prepared by Ferrier Hodgson at the Respondent's request in relation to the Applicant's business activities. 42 The Respondent argues that it is entitled to know what records the Applicant alleges it collected along with any information relating to the substance of the request by the Respondent for the collection of records from the Applicant.
 The remainder of the Respondent's request is a request for evidence and not a proper request for particulars. 46 In relation to Request 24, in my view para 18(b) of the Statement of Claim is ambiguous, for the reason that, on the face of the document, paras 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 do not contain references to information obtained by the Respondent.
