 The Respondent also seeks a time frame as to the events alleged in para 11 where the term 'subsequent' is used. 24 The Applicant objects to this request for particulars on the grounds that it is not a proper request for particulars and that it seeks enquiries into matters wholly within the knowledge of the Respondent. 25 With regard to Request 10, the Respondent is again entitled to particulars in relation to the timing of the alleged event.
 The Respondent submits that if it is said that permission was given but not 'freely', that is entitled to know the facts giving rise to that allegation. 33 The Applicant objects to the requests relating to para 14 on the grounds that they are not proper requests for particulars but are more in the nature of interrogatories. 34 I am prepared to allow limited particularisation of para 14.
 The remainder of the Respondent's request is a request for evidence and not a proper request for particulars. 41 In relation to Request 20, in my view para 16(b) of the Statement of Claim is ambiguous, for the reason that, on the face of the document, paras 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 do not contain references to information obtained by the Respondent.
