 1 This is an 'ex parte' application under s 411(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") for approval of a proposed arrangement between the plaintiff ("Gallery Gold") and its members. 2 On 25 January 2006 the Court made orders under s 411(1) of the Act that a meeting of the members of Gallery Gold be convened to consider the proposed arrangement and that the explanatory statement proposed to be sent to members with notices convening the meeting, as required by s 412(1)(a) of the Act , be approved.
 As required by s 411(17)(b) of the Act , there has been produced to the Court a statement in writing by ASIC that it has no objection to the proposed arrangement. 12 The requirement of s 411(17)(a) of the Act that the Court be satisfied that the arrangement has not been proposed for the purpose of enabling the takeover provisions of Ch 6 of the Act to be avoided, obliged the Court to consider whether a "break fee" of $2,600,000.00 that the directors of the plaintiff had bound the plaintiff to pay to IAMGOLD if another offer to buy the shares of the plaintiff caused the members to reject the proposed arrangement, could have affected the market in the plaintiff's shares and have infringed the spirit of the provisions of Ch 6 of the Act .
