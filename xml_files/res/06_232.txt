 Regulation 5(4) of the Extradition (Republic of South Africa) Regulations which govern extradition requests by a foreign government before 1 August 2001 provides that the Attorney-General may decline to issue a surrender warrant if, while taking into account the nature of the offence to which the extradition request relates and the interests of the requesting country, he is nevertheless of the opinion that in the circumstances of the case, it would be unjust, oppressive or incompatible with humanitarian considerations to surrender the person to that country.
 As to the claim of public interest immunity, the Applicant says this: (a) the position adopted by Ms Blackburn has no application in relation to those documents passing between the Attorney-General's Department and the AHC nor any application to documents from the AHC to the Attorney-General's Department which do not reveal the content of communications with South African authorities.
 Nor do the matters deposed to by Ms Blackburn have any application to documents from the AHC to the relevant South African authorities; (b) the Respondent's claim of public interest immunity is not based upon an assessment of the contents of each document but rather a claim for immunity for a class of documents, namely, confidential communications between Australian government and diplomatic officials and a foreign government; (c) such a claim will only be upheld if it is really necessary for the proper working of government; (d) Ms Blackburn deposes to an opinion and a conclusion "swearing the issue" but gives no explanation of how Australia's international relations will be prejudiced by disclosure of information concerning prison conditions in South Africa.
 Further, this loss of confidence is said to be one which might go beyond exchanges of information on extradition and affect exchanges of information on trans-national criminal matters. 40 The Respondent argues that the affidavit on its proper construction only really asserts the consequence contended in respect of information given by South African authorities to Australian diplomatic officials and does not assert the claim properly as a matter of construction in respect of the related communications between the diplomatic agencies of Australia and communications from the AHC to authorities within the Republic of South Africa.
