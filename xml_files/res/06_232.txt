 On 18 December 1997, a New South Wales Magistrate determined that the Applicant was not "eligible for surrender" under s.19 of the Act and ordered the Applicant's release from custody. 7 On 28 April 1999, that decision was set aside by a judge of this Court and an order made that the Applicant be remanded in custody pending a determination by the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth whether the Applicant ought be surrendered: Republic of South Africa v De Bruyn [1999] FCA 516.
 Some of the other documents bear an Australian government PROTECTED marking, indicating that, though information in the document does not warrant a national security classification, the document nonetheless contains information the unauthorised disclosure of which could cause damage to Australia and its government. " 22 By paragraph 8 of her affidavit, Ms Blackburn deposes to her consideration of the documents both as to each individual document and as to the documents collectively, expresses an opinion and seeks to provide an explanation for the opinion thus formed.
 Paragraph 8 is in these terms: "Having personally considered the documents concerned both individually and collectively and reflected upon whether, where applicable, the national security or other markings on those documents remain appropriate, as well as reflected upon the duties of disclosure that ordinarily attend a party to proceedings in this Honourable Court, I believe that if the information contained within them were disclosed to persons who are not officers of the Attorney-General's Department considering the above application or their legal advisers, it will prejudice the international relations of Australia particularly Australia's relations with the Republic of South Africa.
 The effect of a lessening in confidence has the potential of damaging Australia's working relationship with South Africa that goes beyond cooperation and exchanges of information on extradition and other trans-national criminal matters. " 23 As a result, the Respondent asserts that a proper foundation for a claim of public interest immunity has been established in respect of the documents arising out of the various exchanges deposed to by Ms Nelson and Ms Blackburn. 24 The Applicant calls for production of the documents on the grounds that the documents are relevant to the issues in the proceeding, are conceded by Ms Nelson as relevant to the formulation of the submission to the Minister addressing considerations going to the determination to be made under s.22(2) and that no proper basis has been established for a claim of public interest immunity concerning the documents either individually or as a class of documents.
 Nor do the matters deposed to by Ms Blackburn have any application to documents from the AHC to the relevant South African authorities; (b) the Respondent's claim of public interest immunity is not based upon an assessment of the contents of each document but rather a claim for immunity for a class of documents, namely, confidential communications between Australian government and diplomatic officials and a foreign government; (c) such a claim will only be upheld if it is really necessary for the proper working of government; (d) Ms Blackburn deposes to an opinion and a conclusion "swearing the issue" but gives no explanation of how Australia's international relations will be prejudiced by disclosure of information concerning prison conditions in South Africa.
 Whilst the documents are relevant to the formulation of the submission and the question of whether conditions in South African jails attain a level of risk or threat "so high as to come within the circumstances of which the regulation speaks": Kiefel J, De Bruyn v Minister for Justice and Customs [2004] FCAFC 334 at [66] , the question in issue in the proceedings is not whether the Minister has, for example, failed to provide procedural fairness or otherwise engaged in jurisdictional error.
 In the case of a claim for immunity in respect of that class of documents pre-eminently protected, Gibbs ACJ in Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 at page 43 spoke of the need to establish "a strong case" for the production of the documents, by the party seeking production, before an order for production would be made.
 The fundamental principle is that documents may be withheld from disclosure only if and to the extent, that the public interest renders it necessary. 35 In assessing whether the public interest renders it necessary to withhold documents from disclosure, the foundation facts demonstrating the scope, content and character of the danger to the public interest is necessarily drawn from affidavit material in which those with relevant knowledge of the risks depose to the consequences to the national interest of disclosure.
 Further, this loss of confidence is said to be one which might go beyond exchanges of information on extradition and affect exchanges of information on trans-national criminal matters. 40 The Respondent argues that the affidavit on its proper construction only really asserts the consequence contended in respect of information given by South African authorities to Australian diplomatic officials and does not assert the claim properly as a matter of construction in respect of the related communications between the diplomatic agencies of Australia and communications from the AHC to authorities within the Republic of South Africa.
 I accept that the claim for public interest immunity concerning the information communicated from the Republic of South Africa and transmitted to Australia by the AHC (if it be the case), is established. 42 Because I have reservations about acceptance of the claim in respect of some of the documents, I propose to look at the documents passing between the Attorney-General's Department and the AHC and to assess whether, with the benefit of that examination, the documents should be produced. 43 In relation to the question of Salemi v Holding (supra), there is force in the proposition that the factual circumstances have a significant degree of correspondence with the facts in this case.
