 On the Tribunal's finding, that question was moot. 15 It is important to appreciate that, before the Federal Magistrate, the husband did not challenge the Tribunal's finding that neither he, nor his wife, had a well-founded fear of persecution if required to return to FYROM.
 It had also been based upon other evidence concerning his background, together with the country information to which the Tribunal referred regarding the domestic requirements for obtaining such nationality. 21 Accordingly, his Honour rejected the contention that the Tribunal's finding should be set aside as unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.
 This they plainly could not do. 40 Mr Horan next submitted that, contrary to Mr Gibson's contention, Australian law did not require that there be direct evidence as to the relevant laws governing the acquisition of nationality in FYROM in order to enable the Tribunal to find that the husband was a national of that country.
 It does not, of itself, demonstrate jurisdictional error. 60 If it cannot be said that there was "no evidence" to support the Tribunal's finding that the husband was a FYROM national, the challenge to the sufficiency of that evidence goes nowhere.
