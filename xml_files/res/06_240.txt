 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Smith FM given on 18 November 2005 whereby his Honour dismissed the applicant's earlier application which sought a review of the decision of the Minister's delegate refusing him a protection visa. 2 The application came before his Honour on 18 November 2005 in response to the Minister's application for summary dismissal pursuant to Rule 13.10(c) of the Federal Magistrate's Court rules as an abuse of process.
 An application for leave to appeal to this Court from that decision was dismissed by Madgwick J on 16 September 2005, in the context whereby his Honour spoke of 'the lamentable circumstances of his refusal to accept his legal fate' . 3 The trenchant criticisms of Smith FM concerning the futility of the applicant's various and persistent endeavours to delay his return to India is particularised in some detail in his Honour's reasons for judgment.
