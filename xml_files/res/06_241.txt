 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of Bennett J given and made on 4 November 2005, whereby her Honour refused an application for an order nisi in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 20 September 2000.
 By that decision, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister which had refused the applicant a protection visa. 2 By the applicant's proposed notice of appeal, the applicant seeks a declaration that s 424A(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) is ultra vires the Constitution , and relief is also sought upon the basis of alleged failure of the Tribunal to consider relevant country information.
 A subsequent application for prerogative relief filed with the High Court on 19 May 2003 led to the subsequent remission to the Federal Court of the haring of the order nisi thereby sought, which, as I have above stated, was unsuccessfully pursued before Bennett J. 4 In his oral address to the Court, the applicant was unable to distil any viable basis for reversing in whole or in part the reasons for judgment of Bennett J handed down on 4 November 2005, such as to justify the grant of leave to appeal.
