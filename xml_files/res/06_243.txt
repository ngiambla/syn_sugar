 Her Honour thereby refused an application for an order nisi in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 19 January 2001, which in turn had earlier confirmed the refusal of the Minister's delegate on 23 October 1998 to grant the applicant a protection visa. 2 The applicant arrived in Australia from Bangladesh, his country of origin, on 3 August 1998.
 Subsequently the applicant sought an extension of time for leave to appeal from her Honour's decision to a Full Court of the Federal Court. ' 4 It is readily apparent that the decision of Bennett J was not affected by error in any one or more of the foregoing aspects.
 As her Honour pointed out, in order to obtain the order nisi which the applicant sought, it was necessary for him to show that he had at least an arguable case that the Tribunal, whose proceedings were called into question, had erred in a manner that would justify final relief by way of an order absolute. 5 Bennett J carefully and comprehensively addressed the application for the order nisi sought and the alleged basis therefore, and concluded that none of the grounds relied upon by the applicant was fairly arguable, and that it was therefore inappropriate to grant an order nisi.
 Accordingly her Honour ordered that the application be refused; she also ordered that subrule (1) of Order 51A rule 5 should not apply to the application. 6 In support of the present application, the submissions advanced by the applicant once more sought to rehearse the same or similar complaints concerning the proceedings conducted by the Tribunal and its subsequent decision-making.
