 However, it is submitted that the formal recording of a finding of fact 'reduces the difficulty facing courts in subsequent proceedings of determining whether a particular passage appearing in the reasons for judgment contains a finding of fact': Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Emerald Ocean Distributors Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 303 at [17] .
 It is submitted that formal findings of fact would assist the Court in any subsequent application under s 87(1A) of the Act either by the applicant or any other person who has suffered loss or damage by the conduct of the respondents in contravention of Pt V of the Act.
 Alternatively, it is submitted, that should the Court decline to make a formal order as set out in the terms of orders 1 and 2 of the applicant's minute of orders, it should make an order that the seal of the Court be affixed to the reasons for the purposes of s 83 of the Act. 5 I am unable to agree with this latter alternative proposal.
 Therefore the applicant submits in these circumstances it is entitled to receive all of its costs from the respondents or, in the alternative, a de minimis reduction would be appropriate due to the few representations which were held not to be false and misleading. 37 As to the respondents' submission that the percentage reduction should be increased to reflect the comments in [13] of the reasons and the submission that the applicant's approach precluded settlement, the applicant submits that the reason the nature and the length of the proceedings were protracted was mainly as a result of the respondents' application to join a cross-respondent in an overseas jurisdiction as well as their application for further evidence and possible application to reopen the case.
