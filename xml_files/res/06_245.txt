 First, representatives or agents of the Union (including Messrs Powell and Molina) attended meetings of the Employees on 9 July 2004, 29 July 2004 and 19 August 2004 as a consequence of which meetings the Employees commenced the industrial action the subject of the charge.
 He therefore concluded they had withdrawn their labour in pursuance of their claim in relation to the three issues identified. 41 In relation to the claim by the appellants that they played no part in the industrial action taken by the Employees, his Honour considered that claim could not be substantiated on the evidence.
 The principle evidence related to these grounds is that said by the appellants to establish that the appellants as the 'Union' took positive steps to prevent the withdrawal of labour by the Employees and that the decisions to withdraw labour were those of the Employees.
 In cross-examination Mr Levy testified that on 9 July 2004, once the vote had been taken to withdraw, Mr Powell had said to the workers that they were going down the wrong path and that they should leave the matters open for negotiation. 60 The respondent challenges the claim of the appellant that the actions taken in this respect are capable of being characterised as intended to be preventative of the undertaking of industrial action by the workers.
