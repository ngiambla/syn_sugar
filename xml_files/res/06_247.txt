 The first draft order in the proposed timetable was for Lion Nathan to file and serve a statement of claim on or before Friday, 24 February 2006. 23 On 27 January 2006, Lion Nathan filed a notice of appearance in the Federal Court proceedings and also, as previously mentioned, filed its notice of motion seeking a stay of these proceedings.
 I consider, therefore, that this factor must be regarded as neutral because the prospect of some of Lion Nathan's witnesses having to give evidence in Perth if the Federal Court proceedings are not transferred to New South Wales, must be weighed against the prospect of some of the Plantagenet witnesses having to give evidence in New South Wales if the Federal Court proceedings are transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court.
