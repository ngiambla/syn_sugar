 The first draft order in the proposed timetable was for Lion Nathan to file and serve a statement of claim on or before Friday, 24 February 2006. 23 On 27 January 2006, Lion Nathan filed a notice of appearance in the Federal Court proceedings and also, as previously mentioned, filed its notice of motion seeking a stay of these proceedings.
 It is also pleaded that by reason of Lion Nathan's breach of the distribution agreement, Plantagenet has suffered loss and damage. 31 In the statement of claim in the New South Wales proceedings Lion Nathan pleads that on or about 15 December 2005 Plantagenet purported to terminate the distribution agreement and that Plantagenet was not entitled to terminate the distribution agreement on any of the grounds on which it purported to do so.
 I consider, therefore, that this factor must be regarded as neutral because the prospect of some of Lion Nathan's witnesses having to give evidence in Perth if the Federal Court proceedings are not transferred to New South Wales, must be weighed against the prospect of some of the Plantagenet witnesses having to give evidence in New South Wales if the Federal Court proceedings are transferred to the New South Wales Supreme Court.
 However, counsel for Lion Nathan submits that those proceedings also have substantial connections with jurisdictions outside of Western Australia, namely, that the principal place of business of each of Lion Nathan, Tucker Seabrook and Fine Wine Partners, is in New South Wales, that the breaches of the distribution agreement are alleged to have occurred in States and Territories outside of Western Australia, and, also, that the entry of Lion Nathan into the joint venture is alleged to have occurred outside of Western Australia.
