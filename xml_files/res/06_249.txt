 By those orders, the Minister's objection to competency was upheld, the applicant's substantive proceedings were dismissed, and the applicant was ordered to pay the Minister's costs and disbursements of and incidental to the application. 2.
 Thereafter followed a number of steps and events relating to and attending the applicant's endeavours to obtain a successful review of the Tribunal's decision, which were as follows: (i) the dismissal on 9 September 2004 of an application for review in respect of the Tribunal's decision by Baumann FM; (ii) the dismissal on 11 February 2005 by Hely J of the Federal Court of an appeal from the Federal Magistrate's Court's decision; (iii) the dismissal on 4 August 2005 by Gleeson CJ and Gummow J of an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court from the Federal Court's decision; (iv) the dismissal by Lloyd-Jones FM on 11 November 2005 (as above) of a further application for review of the Tribunal's decision. 4.
 In particular, the applicant made no submission explanatory as to how the Federal Magistrate could have justifiably departed from the decision of a superior court on the question as to whether the decision of the Magistrate constituted a privative clause decision.
