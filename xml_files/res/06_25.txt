 Although I accepted that the Lawsons had lost the confidence of some important members of the Claim Group I was not satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to show that the Claim Group, by appropriate decision-making processes, had revoked their authority to represent it or had authorised other members of the Claim Group to replace them. 3 Following unsuccessful attempts to mediate the issues within the Claim Group, a further application to replace the Lawsons was successful.
 While I would prefer to take the approach advocated in Parsons v Martin (1984) 5 FCR 235 at 241 and refer to this power as an 'incidental and necessary power of a statutory court' rather than as 'inherent', I respectfully accept her Honour's statement of the generally applicable principles. 9 In particular, I see no reason why the Court's incidental power to grant a person leave to appear by a non-lawyer and the power to do so under s 85 of the NTA should not involve similar considerations, particularly in the current context.
 The legislative scheme 26 Section 61(1) of the NTA states, inter alia , that the persons who may make a claimant application include: 'A person or persons authorised by all the persons (the native title claim group ) who, according to their traditional laws and customs, hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed, provided the person or persons are also included in the native title claim group. ' 27 Subsection 61(2) of the NTA provides that the persons authorised to make the claimant application by the native title claim group are jointly the 'applicant' and none of the other members of the native title claim group is the 'applicant'.
