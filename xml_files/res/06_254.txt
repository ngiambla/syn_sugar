 By letter dated 2 March 2006 Mr Fisher wrote to Mr Illek withdrawing his appointment as Mr Fisher's proxy and by letter of the same date Mr Fisher wrote to Mr Eddy withdrawing his statement of claim. 7 By letter dated 3 March 2006, Mr Eddy, pursuant to subs 192(1)(d) of the Act, gave the Official Trustee a written request to be relieved of his duties (as controlling trustee) under Part X of the Act.
 In short, it is said that the Bar Council's lack of standing as a party bringing this application should lead to its dismissal. 22 The different status and standing of the New South Wales Bar Association on the one hand and the Bar Council on the other was the subject of observation in the joint judgment of Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Wentworth v NSW Bar Association [1992] HCA 24 ; (1992) 176 CLR 239 at 248: 'The Bar Association is a company limited by guarantee.
 The Bar Council has no separate legal identity but, as will later appear, it has specific statutory powers and functions in relation to barristers and candidates for admission to the Bar. ' 23 In his written submissions, counsel for Mr Abdul-Karim submitted that the New South Wales Bar Association is not an entity having the benefit of the order for costs relied upon by the Bar Council to establish standing as a creditor nor is it or does it purport to be the applicant in the present proceedings.
 Mr Abdul-Karim in his statement of affairs and, through his counsel, on the hearing of the present application, has conceded that he is indebted to the Bar Council for an amount in respect of such costs orders; clearly, the Bar Council is a creditor in the sum of those amounts, has obtained final judgments in respect thereof and Mr Abdul-Karim has committed acts of bankruptcy. 26 That is enough to provide this Court with jurisdiction to make a sequestration order against the estate of Mr Abdul-Karim on a petition presented by the Bar Council: See subs 43(1) of the Act.
