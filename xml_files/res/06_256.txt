 I have already mentioned that Ms Harkness attended though she was not a senior adviser and did not attend the office on a Friday.
 The plaintiffs allege that in breach of her contract and her statutory and fiduciary duties Ms Manning improperly poached Arrive's clients while still an employee of AMP Services.
 For one thing, during her cross-examination Ms Manning conceded that each member of the group had told her they had applied for employment with GSJBW.
 Then there is the fact that around 27 January Ms Manning discussed with Mr Moir the bonus commissions that should be paid to "people that may join" GSJBW.
