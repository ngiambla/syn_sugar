 Evidence in support in the affidavit of Mr N Gvozdin states that 'HVAC became a proprietary company on 7 July 2005'. 3 Therefore, not only has it changed its name as it did to the present name on 22 September 2005, but also changed its status.
 In addition, there are the written and oral submissions which have been made by the applicant. 5 Reliance is placed on what was said in the Queensland Full Court in Ogilvie-Grant v East [1983] 7 ACLR 669 at 672 by McPherson J with whom Wanstall CJ and Sheahan J agreed, namely, that a section such as s 500(2) of the Act has the purpose for its existence that without the relevant restriction which is constituted by the provision for the grant of leave, a company in liquidation would be subjected to a multiplicity of actions which would be both expensive and time consuming as well, in some cases, unnecessary.
