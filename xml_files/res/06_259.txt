 Ms Blackburn says that the material in the affidavit warrants a "confidential" national security classification having regard to the guidelines set by the Australian Government in the Protective Security Manual adopted by the Government for such matters. 10 The first question to determine was whether I ought properly receive a further affidavit elaborating upon the basis upon which the claim for public interest immunity had been made in the earlier affidavit of Ms Blackburn sworn 2 March and filed on 6 March 2006.
 I have also been referred to National Crime Authority v Gould Anor (1989) 23 FCR 191 at 199, Foster J; Haj-Ismail Ors v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Ors (No. 2) (1982) 64 FLR 112; and Zarro Ors v Australian Securities Commission (1992) 36 FCR 40, Lockhart, Ryan and Gummow JJ. 14 In receiving a further affidavit from the Respondent on the question, there is inevitably some real difficulty in terms of ensuring a balanced opportunity to the Applicant to deal with the additional material.
 In the interests of properly determining the question, I elected to exercise the discretion to receive the affidavit in its aggregated form. 17 I stood the matter down over the luncheon break to read Ms Blackburn's affidavit carefully and the material attached to it comprising the marked-up 20 documents with comments directed to conclusions as to why parts of those documents ought not be disclosed.
 I have indicated that I propose to make an order effective from Monday, 10.15am that those paragraphs that seem safely susceptible to disclosure ought be disclosed and a copy of the affidavit of Ms Blackburn ought be provided to the solicitors for the Applicant masking the confidential paragraphs. 18 Having regard to the affidavit itself, I have formed the view that some aspects of the material marked in a preliminary way for a proposed order for disclosure ought be further marked for non-disclosure on the ground that the additional matters go to the content of possible arrangements government to government.
