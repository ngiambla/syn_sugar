 By faxed letter dated 27 October 2005, the applicants (being respondents to the notice of motion filed on 21 October 2005) asserted subsequently as follows: 'We refer to the above matter which is listed for hearing on 10 November 2005 [that is, the taxation hearing] and note that you have not filed and served your evidence in support of the Bill of Costs as ordered by Registrar Segal on 7 September 2005.
 We hereby advise that we will be filing a Notice of Motion seeking the dismissal of your client's Bill of Costs. ' The assertion that the respondent was ordered by Registrar Segal on 7 September 2005 to file and serve 'evidence in support of the Bill of Costs' appears to involve a misconception, there being no suggestion of any such order apparent on the Court file.
 In any event, no such foreshadowed notice of motion on the part of the applicants for 'dismissal of your client's bill of costs' eventuated. 11 The hearing of the respondent's application by notice of motion for an order that the Court fix a gross sum in relation to its indemnity costs, concerning the proceedings the subject of my reasons for judgment of 20 December 2004, came on for hearing on 22 November 2005.
