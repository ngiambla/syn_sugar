 1 This is an appeal from the whole of the judgment of Nicholls FM given and published on 24 October 2005, whereby his Honour dismissed an application for review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal delivered on 2 August 2004, which in turn affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate made on 21 January 2000 to refuse a protection visa to the appellant. 2 The appellant had applied for a protection visa as long ago as 30 December 1999.
 There is no error of law, let alone any jurisdictional error, involved in the Tribunal making a wrong finding of fact, assuming of course the making of any such wrongful finding being established ( Abebe v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] ). 8 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant relied upon an application which claimed, without particularity, that the Tribunal erred in law and denied the appellant procedural fairness, and which in any event the appellant did not establish.
