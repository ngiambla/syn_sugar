 1 This is an appeal from the whole of the judgment of Nicholls FM given and published on 24 October 2005, whereby his Honour dismissed an application for review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal delivered on 2 August 2004, which in turn affirmed the decision of the Minister's delegate made on 21 January 2000 to refuse a protection visa to the appellant. 2 The appellant had applied for a protection visa as long ago as 30 December 1999.
 The appellant sought a review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court, however the decision of Nicholls FM made on 24 October 2005 was once more unfavourable to the appellant. 3 The appellant's claims as to fear of persecution made to the Tribunal related to his circumstances in Georgia said to involve and to result from his ethnicity and political opinion.
 There is no error of law, let alone any jurisdictional error, involved in the Tribunal making a wrong finding of fact, assuming of course the making of any such wrongful finding being established ( Abebe v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [137] ). 8 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant relied upon an application which claimed, without particularity, that the Tribunal erred in law and denied the appellant procedural fairness, and which in any event the appellant did not establish.
 Moreover the appellant filed with the Court submissions which his Honour comprehensively addressed at [5]-[10] of her reasons, concluding that no error was demonstrated in the Tribunal's decision, and that case related in any event to a privative clause decision within s 474 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). 9 The appeal must inevitably be dismissed with costs.
