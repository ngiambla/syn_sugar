 The trial judge accepted the explanation for the delay in making application for leave to amend the defence, however refused the application to amend the defence on the basis, inter alia, that the amendments would jeopardise the hearing dates, and would have the result that the matter would be unlikely to be relisted until the following year.
 But it should not have been allowed to prevail over the injustice of shutting the applicants out from raising an arguable defence, thus precluding the determination of an issue between the parties. ' (at 155) THE PRESENT MATTER 12 The Statement of Claim in the case before me was filed and served by the applicants on 29 July 2005.
 Rescheduling the trial date for a matter which the parties estimate requires five days, to a date in the immediate future will prove challenging for this Court in view of current court lists and the availability of counsel, and may also mean that the respondents are in the unsatisfactory situation of being parties to this litigation for some time. 13 From the respondents' viewpoint, the reasons behind the engagement of new solicitors by the applicants and any consequent impediments to the applicants pursuing their claims, are the problems of the applicants.
 At this hearing I indicated to the respondents my preliminary view that the material then before the court did not provide any grounds for making of an order for security for costs, and I adjourned the hearing of this matter until last Friday 17 March 2006. 23 On 15 March 2006, an affidavit was sworn by one of the applicants, Paul Robert Wellard.
