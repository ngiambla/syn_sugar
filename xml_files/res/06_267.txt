 In making that observation, I do not overlook the observation of Hill and Lander JJ in the Spassked appeal (at [77]), which I have earlier extracted, that ' [i]ncome tax is an annual tax [and] [h]ence the question whether interest was incurred in gaining or producing assessable income or in carrying on a business the purpose of which was the gaining of assessable income is a question which is required to be determined from year to year '.
 The Commissioner would characterise as a fact fundamental to the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings the findings there made, which I have earlier recorded concerning critical circumstances and features involved in relation to the fiscal years 1988 to 1994, and the inherently consequential implications thereof to deductibility for income tax purposes in respect of the year of income 1992 the subject of resolution by the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings. 72 The taxpayer applicants asserted further that none of the authorities relied on by the Commissioner addressed what the taxpayer applicants described as the divergence of views between Hoysted and Broken Hill in relation to tax matters, save briefly in Falk v Haugh [1935] HCA 35 ; (1935) 53 CLR 163.
 Unlike fiscal litigation involving or relating for instance merely to quantifications of value of realty or personalty, or of losses and outgoings otherwise uncontroversial in character, the resolution of the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings required the Federal Court's consideration of a spectrum of circumstances relating to the business operations of Spassked which had taken place in substantial commercial contexts, being circumstances which extended in scope beyond the duration of the 1992 fiscal year, antecedently as well as subsequently.
