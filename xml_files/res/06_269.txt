 There is evidence before me that on 12 November 2004 the District Registrar of the court wrote to the applicant a letter in which inter alia, among other things, the Registrar said that: 'The Court proposed to consider whether there was an arguable case on the basis of the written material that you have given to the court and without any oral hearing.
 Before the court makes a decision you may make such written submissions in the English language as you wish on the question of whether the court should make an order nisi . ' 2 Apparently in response to that invitation the applicant filed with the court an outline of submissions dated 18 January 2005 which is in evidence before me.
 The applicant sought an adjournment of this hearing for three weeks which I refused for reasons which I delivered earlier today. 3 The question as to whether or not leave should be granted to appeal from an interlocutory decision requires the court to have regard to well-established principles.
 These are that an applicant for leave must establish that the decision in question is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave and must also show that substantial injustice will result from a refusal of leave to appeal: Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 at 231 [29] . 4 The applicant has been involved in a challenge to the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirming the decision of the delegate of the first respondent ('the Minister') since the Tribunal's decision was given on 12 March 1998.
