 THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS 4 There appears to be little doubt that the Tribunal accepted that active and public participation in the Falun Gong movement in China would render the applicant vulnerable to persecution by the Chinese authorities.
 The Tribunal pointed that out to the applicant in the course of the hearing, but he did not take up the opportunity of presenting any independent witness to confirm that he had (as he claimed) on a few occasions engaged in communal Falun Gong exercises.
 The applicant did not claim in the course of the hearing that the Tribunal's questions did not relate to Master Li's teachings, and accepted that he did not have a deep level of knowledge of those teachings.
