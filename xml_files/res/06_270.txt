 His explanation for that was that he had not been practising for a long time. 13 In my view, the Tribunal's finding of fact that the applicant had been untruthful, in particular about his claim to have been a Falun Gong practitioner since mid 2002 was reached without jurisdictional error.
 And the first of those is that a true and dedicated practitioner and cultivator would not be limited to practice at home or in the courtyard at, at a time and place that is suitable to them.
 I know that Master Li does not prescribe the ways in which a cultivator should practice but I would expect a, a dedicated and serious practitioner to make an effort to attend discussion groups, to have uh the advice and guidance of, of more learned people to assist them to, to develop and learn more themselves.
