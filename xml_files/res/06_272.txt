 Alternatively, it is submitted that if the evidence is not sought to be tendered to prove the existence of the 'asserted fact' as defined in s 59(2) of the Evidence Act , then it is irrelevant. 4 In respect of the vast number of hearsay objections, the applicant submits that supplementary affidavits would clarify what events were observed by the deponent and what were observed by others.
 In reply to this, the respondents submit that such is not a satisfactory course and that the appropriate course is to strike out paragraphs which are expressed in a manner suggesting they are not based on the deponent's personal knowledge or which leave the Court unable to determine whether they are or are not based on such knowledge.
 Where those paragraphs are not the subject of other objections, the applicant undertakes that the submissions in those paragraphs will be taken up by way of submission following the evidence of the respondents' witnesses to which they relate.
 The applicant responds generally that the deponent, by reason of her qualifications and experience as set out in her affidavit and in particular her lengthy experience with the community in question, is qualified as an expert to provide opinions so far as they can be related to and are based on her observations over the 26 years of the applicant community at Lockridge campsite.
