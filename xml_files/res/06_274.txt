 As at 4 April 2005, the combined holding of shares in the Company of Glencore, CSFB and ABN Amro was 33,222,745 shares, representing 11.05 per cent of the issued shares of the Company. 16 No announcement of any acquisition of shares in the Company by Glencore and Fornax or of the existence of the swaps was made before 4 April 2005.
 The Panel made orders on 25 July 2005 requiring Glencore to offer to sell Company shares to each person who sold Company shares in a transaction reported to ASX during the Non-disclosure Period. 21 On 29 September 2005, the individuals named as first respondent in this proceeding were constituted as the Takeovers Panel to deal with the remitted matter.
 It will have that capacity either because the relevant interest or voting power is substantial in its own right or because the impact of the acquisition of that particular relevant interest or voting power is substantial as a step in the direction of takeover or change in control in a company.
 On the other hand, the Panel concluded that, by reason of the existence of the swaps, Glencore had a de facto power to prevent the Banks from disposing of their shares, such that those shares should be taken into account in determining whether Glencore had acquired, or was acquiring, a substantial interest in the Company.
