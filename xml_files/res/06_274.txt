 As at 4 April 2005, the combined holding of shares in the Company of Glencore, CSFB and ABN Amro was 33,222,745 shares, representing 11.05 per cent of the issued shares of the Company. 16 No announcement of any acquisition of shares in the Company by Glencore and Fornax or of the existence of the swaps was made before 4 April 2005.
 On the other hand, the Panel concluded that, by reason of the existence of the swaps, Glencore had a de facto power to prevent the Banks from disposing of their shares, such that those shares should be taken into account in determining whether Glencore had acquired, or was acquiring, a substantial interest in the Company.
