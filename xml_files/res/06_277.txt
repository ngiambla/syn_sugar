 In any event, the Administrators are confident that regardless of the outcome of any litigation, third party creditors would control a significant majority of votes at a creditors' meeting of AAE. 21 The Administrators have reached a compromise with three of those creditors, National Australia Bank Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and BNP Paribas (the "AAE Bank Creditors").
 In many instances the books and records contain insufficient information to determine whether the liabilities recorded are actually payable and, if so, whether those liabilities have, in fact, been paid. 55 Any reconstruction of the inter-company loan balances would require us to consider whether to charge interest on unpaid (or apparently unpaid) amounts and, if so, to undertake those calculations.
 Thus, if there is no pooling of the assets and liabilities of all the companies in the Ansett Group, there is no fund out of which the payments to the AAE Bank Creditors can be made. 57 According to the Administrators, pooling has different effects for priority creditors and non-priority creditors depending upon the particular company in the Ansett Group involved.
 The Administrators are confident that if they called for and admitted proofs of debt in AAE third party creditors would control a significant majority of votes and would vote against pooling. 67 The Administrators entered into the AAE Pooling Compromise Deed in order to resolve existing disputes, avoid potentially costly and uncertain litigation and with a view to maximising returns to Deed Creditors.
