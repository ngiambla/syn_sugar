 His symptoms nevertheless persisted during 2002 and he required ongoing medical supervision and treatment. 6 On 24 September 2002, the applicant was examined by Dr Awerbuch, a rheumatologist, at the request of the respondent.
 On 4 December 2002, a delegate of the respondent decided that on and from 3 December 2002 the respondent was 'no longer liable to pay compensation for your claim under any provision of the Act'.
 Nevertheless, the applicant before the Tribunal appears to have contended that the first decision was invalid because it purported to revoke the liability which had been accepted under s 14 of the Act in respect of the accepted injury otherwise than by the review process under s 62 of the Act.
 The respondent does not now contest that. 43 The final step in the Tribunal's reasoning, namely whether there is permanent impairment from those conditions, is where the applicant's medical witnesses were not in accord.
