 The second was an application for review of a further decision of the respondent in the matter of an application for a Disability Support Pension made on 22 July 2004. 8 Both applications, and the decision by the AAT on them, have to be considered in the context of many acrimonious disputes between the applicant and Centrelink, and the respondent Department and some of its officers.
 The reasoning of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in paragraphs 15 to 17 of its decision made 11 October 2004 in disposing of the application for review to that Tribunal of the disability support claim rejection decision made by the Respondent is correct and unimpeachable. ' 22 No error of law attends the conclusions of the Tribunal expressed in this paragraph.
 This age pension claim suffers from the same defects in content that were identified by McCabe SM in Theo and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] AATA 1273 and which were the subject of an unsuccessful appeal to the Federal Court in the proceedings determined against the Applicant as Theo v Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2005] FCA 880.
