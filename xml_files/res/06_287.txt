 1 The matter before the Court is an application under s 178 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act ") to review a decision of the respondent, the applicant's trustee in bankruptcy, to refuse to consent to the applicant's request to travel overseas and to return her passport to enable her to travel for that purpose.
 Although the applicant has a brother and a sister she asserts that they do not have the knowledge or the experience to undertake the relevant rituals and rites that the Hindu religion requires to be carried out for her mother. 6 Accordingly, on 8 March 2006 the applicant's solicitor wrote to the respondent requesting permission for her to travel to Singapore to meet with her father and then travel to India to participate in the Pinda daan ceremony.
 The applicant had also been involved with another person who was involved in two property development companies which were also in liquidation. 10 The applicant presently works as a part-time cook and assistant in a business carried on by her daughter through a company called Ishwar Pty Ltd, trading as Essence of the East.
