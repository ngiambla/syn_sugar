 If Leighton, as the other party to the Contract, was not advised of the direction, there is reasonable cause to believe that there may have been an improper arrangement between PKM and the Principal. 33 PKM, on the other hand, says that the arrangements evidenced by the two communications and the flow charts do not contain the slightest suggestion that either PKM or the Principal intended that the Principal act in breach of its obligations under the Contract in connection with the performance of functions by PKM as the Superintendent.
 It is unnecessary to deal with those elements in the light of the conclusion that I have reached concerning the pivotal basis for alleging an arrangement of understanding that PKM and the Principal intended or contemplated that the Superintendent, whether it was PKM or an employee of PKM, would not act honestly and fairly and would not act independently in exercising independent functions under the Contract or would not act in accordance with the Contract. 36 The second cause of action involves the assertion that, in the course of administering the Contract, PKM, as Superintendent, acted in accordance with private arrangements and discussions with, and decisions of, the Principal and, thereby, failed to act honestly and fairly, failed to act independently in exercising functions under the Contract and failed to act in accordance with the Contract.
 That is a measure of the misrepresentation of how advanced the design was. ' 54 Paragraphs 3.3.5 to 3.3.40 of the Notice of Dispute may be summarised as follows: 3.3.5 The Principal issue the request for tender to Leighton on 7 May 2002; 3.3.6 On 9 May 2002, the Principal gave a tender briefing to Leighton and confirmed to Leighton that the project was at an advanced state of design, with only minor detailing to be done.
