 I am satisfied from the evidence that, in any event, there is no reason to believe that the company is insolvent and, indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. 2 That being so, I have no doubt that the liquidation should be reversed.
 It was put to me that one mechanism for doing this is for there to be a review of the Registrar's orders rather than for there to be an order terminating the winding up pursuant to s 482 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
