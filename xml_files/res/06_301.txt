 1 This is a matter in which the Registrar made an order on 16 December 2005 winding up British Finance Pty Ltd (ABN 52 096 757 836) (the company).
 It also appears that the company did not become aware of the proceedings because of an error concerning its registered office so there was, in fact, a series of errors.
 I am satisfied from the evidence that, in any event, there is no reason to believe that the company is insolvent and, indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. 2 That being so, I have no doubt that the liquidation should be reversed.
 It was put to me that one mechanism for doing this is for there to be a review of the Registrar's orders rather than for there to be an order terminating the winding up pursuant to s 482 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
