 CONCLUSION 83 The only issue to be determined in the Pharmacia Proceeding is whether claim 1, in its current form, is a claim that involves a "pharmaceutical substance per se ". 84 Unlike Interpharma, in the Interpharma Review Proceeding, Mayne does not contend that Pharmacia's product is not relevantly a "pharmaceutical substance".
 Claims which limit the use of a known substance to a particular environment, for example claims to pharmaceutical substances when used in a new and inventive method of treatment, are not considered to be claims to pharmaceutical substances per se . ' This distinction is specifically evident as between the reference in the Act to 'pharmaceutical substances per se ', and to 'pharmaceutical substances when produced by a process that involves the use of recombinant DNA technology'.
 However, it had been submitted that the requirements of s 70(2)(a) were met, and that Heerey J had erroneously interpreted paragraph (a) "as requiring the claim or claims of the patent to exclusively define a pharmaceutical substance per se or to be limited or confined to a pharmaceutical substance per se ".
 Is claim 1, when read sensibly, and as a whole, properly to be understood as a claim to a new and inventive substance, or are the various references to process elements in that claim, upon which Mayne relied, sufficient to take it outside the ambit of a "pharmaceutical substance per se "? 98 The matter must largely be one of impression, and degree.
