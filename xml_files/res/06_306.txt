 There is no evidence to indicate that an announcement was made that the function had concluded. " 8 All or almost all of the diving team who were at work at the base that day attended the function.
 The number who attended was in excess of thirty and could have been as many as forty. 9 The Tribunal found at [28] that there was the "clear understanding of most members of the diving team that it was necessary for them to attend the function".
 In due course there were only eight or so remaining and they continued there until about 5.30 pm when a number of those remaining helped clean up the site. 12 The respondent arrived at the function soon after 12.00 and remained until about 6.00 pm.
 Rather, counsel submitted that, at some time before the respondent left, the function ceased to have the character of an officially-approved work function. 21 Understandably, counsel for the applicant did not submit that the Tribunal was obliged to find that the work-related character of the function ceased on the dot of 3.50 or 4.00 pm.
