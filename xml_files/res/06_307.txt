 The Tribunal concluded that a fair-minded reasonable member of the Australian community would expect that the applicant's visa should be cancelled. 18 The Tribunal then went on to consider matters required by the Direction.
 It was entirely open to the Tribunal to conclude on the evidence, and particularly that relating to the offence itself, that the applicant was a man who was, in the language of the Tribunal, "self-absorbed, emotive and vengeful".
