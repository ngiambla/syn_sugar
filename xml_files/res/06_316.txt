 The Tribunal accepts that the nominator and the visa applicant have a strong and close relationship, which is also applicable to their two families, and that the nominator is more comfortable receiving assistance from the visa applicant.
 On the evidence presented to it, the Tribunal finds that the nominator does not suffer from any prolonged illness which results in a permanent or long term need for assistance, and that this finding is also applicable to the members of his family unit.
