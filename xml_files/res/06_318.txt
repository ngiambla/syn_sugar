 These provisions are set out in par 100, above. 539 Sections 9L and 9M of the Validation Act require the Court to determine the extent to which a previous non-exclusive possession act involves the grant of rights that are inconsistent with native title in relation to the leasehold land.
 The determination declared (par 5) that the native title rights and interests over a part of the determination area included: '(a) a right to possess, occupy, use and enjoy the land; [and] (b) a right to make decisions about the use and enjoyment of the land'.
 He pointed out that neither s 5 nor s 6 of the Validation Act (the counterparts to s 15(1)(a) and (b) of the NTA ) specifies the date from which the extinguishment of native title by reason of category A past acts takes effect.
 REASONING: THE TIMING OF EXTINGUISHMENT 741 It follows from what I have said that the construction of the Public Works on the Application Area was invalid and therefore did not, independently of the NTA and the Validation Act , extinguish any native title rights and interests then subsisting over the land.
