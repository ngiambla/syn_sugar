 That Act provided that the only person who could apply for a patent was the "actual inventor" or his assigns or legal representatives (if deceased) or a person to whom the invention had been communicated by the "actual inventor" or his representatives or assigns: s 7(3).
 The application for the patent was required to declare that the applicant, or, if more than one, the applicants, claimed to be the "true and first inventor or inventors": s 8(2). "True and first inventor" was defined in s 3 to mean "the actual inventor of any invention" or his assigns or legal representatives, "but shall not include a person importing an invention from any other colony or country without the authority of the actual inventor".
 The next step is that, seeing that it is permissible to issue a patent to joint inventors, the words "the patentee is" in s 138(3)(a) must, in the case of a joint grant, be read as "the patentees are" (see also s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)).
