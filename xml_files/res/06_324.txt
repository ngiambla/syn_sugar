 In application WAD 9 of 2004, the son of the applicants in this application, Iwan Salim, also known as John Salim, seeks relief founded on claims that he was induced to invest monies in a project carried out by the fifth respondent, which I will call the 'ostrich scheme', by misleading and deceptive conduct engaged in by and on behalf of the fifth respondent. 5 In accordance with the directions of French J referred to above, the applicants in this case filed witness statements dated 5 December 2005.
 In this regard, the third respondent submits that the applicants' witness statements disclose that the money which was provided for the investment in the ostrich scheme and which was paid to the fifth respondent for that purpose, was paid by the son and not the applicants. 8 The applicants submit the principles in Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 ('Webster') apply to this application.
