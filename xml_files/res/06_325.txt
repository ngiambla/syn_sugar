 Applying a consistent penalty in this matter involves the Court in imposing a penalty of $13,200 on Southern Cross for breach of cl 46.2.1 of the Award and no additional penalty for its breach of cl 46.2.6. 36 In Lotus Cove , Merkel J imposed an additional penalty of 24 per cent of the maximum for breach of cl 46.2.3 of the Award.
 I see no reason to depart from that approach. 38 In Lotus Cove , Merkel J imposed a penalty of 40 per cent of the maximum available for the breach of cl 46.7 concerning the failure of Lotus Cove to provide information to an outworker.
 In the similar circumstances of this matter a like penalty is appropriate and I impose a penalty of $13,200 on Southern Cross for its breach of cl 46.7. 39 In Lotus Cove there was no separate finding of a breach of any of the following terms of the Award; cll 46.4.1, 46.4.2 and 47.3.1.
