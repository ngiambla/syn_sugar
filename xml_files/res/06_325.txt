 It intended that such work be performed outside the premises of Southern Cross. 9 Mr Leongue informed Ms Kruschel of the Union that he had "no idea" whether the persons to whom Southern Cross gave outwork were respondents to the Award.
 He said that between November/December 2003 and 8 September 2004, Southern Cross had given out work valued at about $70,000 and had been doing so for two to three years before 8 September 2004. 10 Mr Leongue admitted to Ms Kruschel that Southern Cross was not registered to give work out.
 Apart from Mr Leongue's admission in that regard, Southern Cross does not appear on the List of Employers registered by the Clothing Trades Board of Registration held by the Australian Industrial Registry. 13 Southern Cross acted in breach of cl 48.1 of the Award from the time it became a party to the Award on 20 December 2002, until 8 September 2004.
 The three persons or entities to whom work was given out referred to at [8] above were not respondents to the Award, they were in the category of one of three classes of non- respondents identified in cl 46.1.1(c), (d) and (e).
 The Award - keeping of lists 24 Clause 46.4.3 obliges an employer who gives out work to keep lists of persons to whom the work is given out, lists of contracts entered into with such persons and lists of addresses.
 The breaches are serious and appear to have been committed in defiance of Part 9 of the Award. 31 Given the above factors, it would ordinarily be appropriate to order a high range penalty in respect of the breach of each term of the Award.
 Also, Mr Leongue, when interviewed by Union officials did not attempt to conceal the Award breaches and co-operated with the Union. 32 In Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Lotus Cove Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 43 , Merkel J found that various breaches of cl 46 and cl 48 of the Award had occurred over a period of about one year.
 He imposed no additional penalty on Lotus Cove for related breach of cl 46.1.3 for failing to make an application to register. 33 The circumstances prevailing in this matter and the circumstances in Lotus Cove are very similar, save that the period of time over which the breaches occurred in this instance is almost twice as long.
 Although the non-observance of cl 46.1.3 is technically another breach of a term of an award, consistently with the reasoning of Merkel J in Lotus Cove at [49], I consider that the breach of cl 48.1 and that of cl 46.1.3 to "essentially relate to one omission".
 Applying a consistent penalty in this matter involves the Court in imposing a penalty of $13,200 on Southern Cross for breach of cl 46.2.1 of the Award and no additional penalty for its breach of cl 46.2.6. 36 In Lotus Cove , Merkel J imposed an additional penalty of 24 per cent of the maximum for breach of cl 46.2.3 of the Award.
 I see no reason to depart from that approach. 38 In Lotus Cove , Merkel J imposed a penalty of 40 per cent of the maximum available for the breach of cl 46.7 concerning the failure of Lotus Cove to provide information to an outworker.
