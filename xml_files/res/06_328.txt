 That exception enables an applicant for a spouse visa who is no longer living in a continuing relationship with his or her spouse at the time of the visa decision to maintain the claim for that visa. 5 On 30 April 2002, the respondent Minister's delegate refused the application on various grounds.
 In other words, the appellant's application was certain to be rejected because it could not meet the requirements of reg 1.26 and reg 1.24(2)(a)(ii). 39 As previously indicated, the Federal Magistrate did not consider any of the grounds of appeal that related to the statutory declarations and police records.
 THE RESPONDENT'S CONTENTIONS ON APPEAL 60 Ms Riley, who appeared on behalf of the Minister, submitted that the notice of appeal filed in this Court appeared to challenge the decision of the Federal Magistrate only in relation to the MRT's finding that the relationship between the appellant and the nominator was not genuine and continuing, at least at the time of the application.
 However, she submitted that when the MRT used this terminology, it had merely expressed itself infelicitously, and had done no more than what VSAF expressly contemplated and approved. 73 With regard to the statutory declarations, Ms Riley submitted that there was nothing implicit in them that suggested that the competent person held the opinions required under reg 1.26.
