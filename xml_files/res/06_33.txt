 In Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341 (although the letter of offer raised other considerations and the implications of the relationship between the common law principles and the rules of the Court in question), the proposal was put on the basis that "each party bear its own costs". 54 Ordinarily, of course, the "without prejudice" letter of offer is inadmissible.
 The reservation as to costs enables the letter to be admitted for the purpose of determining whether the offeree was confronted with a clear and precise offer, whether the offer was materially better than the ultimate outcome and whether in all the circumstances, in rejecting the letter the offeree acted reasonably. 55 Although the letter of offer properly construed made an offer of compensation coupled with a term not to oppose an application for costs, the offer did not clearly and precisely make it plain to the Applicant, at the time of the offer, that he would obtain his taxed costs of the proceeding to that date.
 The Tribunal took the view the letter did "not refer to costs" (eg. the Applicant's costs to the date of the offer) whereas the Court takes the view that the letter does, as a matter of construction, deal with the Applicant's costs to the date of the letter by indicating the Respondent would not oppose an application for costs.
 This difference of construction of the letter of offer suggests the letter is not, in terms, clear and precise and not one, as a matter of principle, "couched in such terms as enable the offeree to make a carefully considered comparison between the offer made and the ultimate relief it is seeking in all its aspects ": Dr Martens v Figgins Holdings (supra) [24].
