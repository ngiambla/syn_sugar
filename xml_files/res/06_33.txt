 In Leichhardt Municipal Council v Green [2004] NSWCA 341 (although the letter of offer raised other considerations and the implications of the relationship between the common law principles and the rules of the Court in question), the proposal was put on the basis that "each party bear its own costs". 54 Ordinarily, of course, the "without prejudice" letter of offer is inadmissible.
 The Tribunal took the view the letter did "not refer to costs" (eg. the Applicant's costs to the date of the offer) whereas the Court takes the view that the letter does, as a matter of construction, deal with the Applicant's costs to the date of the letter by indicating the Respondent would not oppose an application for costs.
