 These are: (1) an application to review the registrar's decision of 11 November 2005; (2) an application for an order that the statutory demand be set aside; (3) an application for an extension of time in which to comply with the statutory demand; (4) an application for leave to make application for an injunction restraining Brobo from proceeding with its winding up application; and (5) an application for an interlocutory injunction restraining Rock Solid and Milton from dealing in certain goods and intellectual property said to be owned by G J Gears. 10 G J Gears relied upon numerous affidavits filed in proceeding 1050.
 G J Gears also relied upon affidavits filed in proceeding 1033, namely, the affidavits of Grant Shirley sworn on 6 February 2006 and Gary Needham sworn on 6 February 2006 . 11 The respondents also relied on numerous affidavits filed in proceeding 1033.
 They were the affidavits of Daniel Milton sworn on 24 February 2006 and 27 February 2006; Michael Witt sworn on 24 February 2006; and John Boydston sworn on 7 October 2005 and 23 February 2006, as well as a further affidavit filed on 7 March 2006.
 In late 2002, Grant Shirley, together with another director of G J Gears, Barry Rowe, developed a drive line (named the "Rockcrusher 60R") for export to the United States. 14 In early 2003, G J Gears began discussions with Brobo about the possibility of Brobo machining parts for G J Gears.
 Shirley said that Rockcrusher-USA had not placed any order with G J Gears since about February 2005. 16 In an affidavit that was before the registrar, Shirley deposed that G J Gears owed Brobo $258,661.26 for the manufacture of goods prior to 9 February 2005 and presently owed Brobo $349,185.76, which included an amount for the goods that Brobo had taken in April 2005.
 According to Shirley, this mark is cast on differentials machined by Brobo for G J Gears. 18 In an affidavit of 3 October 2005, Shirley said, in reply to Milton (see below) that, when Barry Rowe first asked Milton whether Brobo could do machining for the plaintiff, Rowe took with him an original Dana 60 differential.
 Also according that affidavit, G J Gears supplied Brobo with pattern drawings and patterns for other products. 19 In his affidavit of 3 October 2005, Shirley claimed that G J Gears had an offsetting claim against Brobo in the sum of $343,217 for the goods for which Boydston had not paid, alternatively, $425,000 by way of damages for defective goods.
 He also claimed that Brobo undertook all the pattern work. 27 Milton deposed that the principal reason for the difficulties between Rockcrusher-USA and the Australian supply company (said not to be G J Gears) was that the US company "had paid for goods in advance and was consistently given different reasons why the product was not being shipped".
 Boydston corroborated Milton. 28 In an affidavit before the registrar, Milton said that, as at 11 October 2005, one shipment of products had left Brobo's premises for transportation to Boydston and that no item in this shipment carried the Little Rock mark.
 In an earlier affidavit, Milton said that the products recovered from G J Gears remained in Brobo's custody. 29 In affidavits before the registrar, Milton deposed that, between late 2004 and early 2005, Brobo became concerned about monies owing to it by G J Gears.
 He denied that there was a contract between Brobo and G J Gears to the effect alleged by G J Gears and that he had any conversations with Boydston and Davis as alleged by Davis. 31 Also in his 24 February 2006 affidavit, Milton said that, in November 2005, he and the other director and shareholder of Brobo decided to separate.
