 G J Gears also relied upon affidavits filed in proceeding 1033, namely, the affidavits of Grant Shirley sworn on 6 February 2006 and Gary Needham sworn on 6 February 2006 . 11 The respondents also relied on numerous affidavits filed in proceeding 1033.
 They were the affidavits of Daniel Milton sworn on 24 February 2006 and 27 February 2006; Michael Witt sworn on 24 February 2006; and John Boydston sworn on 7 October 2005 and 23 February 2006, as well as a further affidavit filed on 7 March 2006.
 Boydston corroborated Milton. 28 In an affidavit before the registrar, Milton said that, as at 11 October 2005, one shipment of products had left Brobo's premises for transportation to Boydston and that no item in this shipment carried the Little Rock mark.
 G J Gears contended that this affidavit constituted evidence of a deliberate attempt by Brobo, through its director, Milton, to interfere with the exclusive distributorship agreement between G J Gears and Rockcrusher-USA; to take control of G J Gears' intellectual property; and to put G J Gears out of business and take G J Gears' business for itself.
