 I accepted that there was no evidence that Siminton proposed to leave Australia but stated: 'having regard to the public interest aspect of this litigation, the harm that would be suffered by the public if [Siminton] did leave, ..... the difficulty [APRA] is having in locating the respondent and, in particular, [Siminton's] clear indication that he does not recognise the processes of Australian law to be binding upon him, this is an exceptional case that justifies the orders being applied for by [APRA]. ' 8 Since the making of the orders, it has been discovered that since 9 August 2001 Siminton has been an undischarged bankrupt who has failed to provide a statement of affairs, or to surrender his passport, to his trustee as required by the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).
 For the reasons there expressed (save that there may no longer be a difficulty in locating Siminton) this is an exceptional case in which it is in the public interest that the Court ensures that Siminton's presence in Australia is secured to prevent the Court's processes from being frustrated and, in particular, to ensure that any relief to which APRA may become entitled is able to be effective.
