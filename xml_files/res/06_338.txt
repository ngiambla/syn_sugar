 Finally, I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried. 8 In the course of the hearing, I raised with counsel the question whether it was appropriate for this Court to accept undertakings of the kind I have described where the leave relates to the conduct of proceedings in the Supreme Court.
 My concern was that the ongoing supervision of the undertakings by this Court may be less than convenient in circumstances where the underlying proceedings are being conducted in another Court. 9 Counsel for both parties submitted that it was appropriate for the Court to accept the undertakings notwithstanding this potential difficulty.
