 Finally, I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried. 8 In the course of the hearing, I raised with counsel the question whether it was appropriate for this Court to accept undertakings of the kind I have described where the leave relates to the conduct of proceedings in the Supreme Court.
 My concern was that the ongoing supervision of the undertakings by this Court may be less than convenient in circumstances where the underlying proceedings are being conducted in another Court. 9 Counsel for both parties submitted that it was appropriate for the Court to accept the undertakings notwithstanding this potential difficulty.
 They submitted that it is not unusual for a Court to retain, after final orders and undertakings have been made, the responsibility for dealing with any application arising from an alleged breach of the undertakings. 10 It was also submitted that if any question of breach of the undertakings did arise in future, this Court would always retain, at that point of time, a discretion under s 1337H of the Act to transfer the application regarding the alleged breach of the undertakings to the Supreme Court if it considered that it would be in the interests of justice to do so.
