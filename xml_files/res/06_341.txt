 The Tribunal refused to continue to adjourn the hearing, at the applicant's request, and resumed it without any notification or consultation made to the applicant: Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 1 ALD 383; New York Properties P/L v Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 7 FCR 401. 7.
 Question 13 52 This question asserts that the AAT failed to make findings on all material questions of fact as required by s 43(2B) of the AAT Act . 53 The applicant contends that findings ought to have been made on the various matters of fact she sought to agitate.
 These included matters personal to the relationship with her former friends and her contention that she was not suffering from a disability. 54 None of the matters put forward by the applicant as findings which ought to have been made amounted to material or relevant questions of fact within s 43(2B).
 Question 14 55 This question asserts that the AAT dealt with the matter on the erroneous assumption that the applicant has consented to participate in a Commonwealth program or a Commonwealth-State program under the DSA or another enactment. 56 No such assumption was made.
