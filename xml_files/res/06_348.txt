 However, this document is subject to a claim for privilege. 8 At the time the Alchemy Paper was provided to the applicants, the Statement of Claim filed in the proceedings did not include any claim based on cl 8A of the OCSA or on any related misleading or deceptive conduct.
 I am content to deal with the application to set aside the notice to produce on the basis that, as Optus contends, common law principles apply. 12 On that basis, however, it seems to me that Optus has waived privilege in the legal advice referred to in the Alchemy Paper.
