 BACKGROUND 2 The substance of the matter before his Honour involved an application under section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) to quash the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirming a decision of the delegate of the respondent ('the Minister') to cancel the applicant's visa pursuant to section 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').
 In fact, his Honour quite clearly was aware of and referred to the applicant's counsel's reference to the Tribunal's treatment of the applicant's head injury in paragraphs 11 and 21 of the judgment. 4 The draft notice of appeal, included with the applicant's application papers that were filed in the Registry on 30 January 2006 but bear dates of preparation of 25 and 26 January, includes grounds alleging that there was a failure by the respondent, his Department and Edmonds J to give adequate proper, genuine and realistic weight to the applicant's argument in relation to his health, mental impairment, mental illness and the applicant's permanent disability of epilepsy.
 We never go into much detail on the merits, but we do like to know something about the case before deciding whether or not to extend the time. ' 6 In his judgment for the same case, Kirby J also referred to Lord Denning's remarks (see [1998] HCA 27 ; 195 CLR 516 at 540-541 [66] ). 7 The Full Court of this court in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195 adopted a similar approach by holding that there must, in accordance with O 52 r 15(2), be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed although filed after the expiry of 21 days. 8 I am of opinion that in this matter there are insufficient prospects to warrant a grant of an extension of time in which to appeal.
 I am not satisfied that the applicant has put forward any sufficient reason to show why an extension of time should be granted to him. 9 The applicant has referred in oral argument to another detainee at the Villawood Detention Centre who is assisting him in the preparation of this application.
