 The appeal and its disposition 5 The three grounds pursued in the appeal were that: (i) The Tribunal failed to comply with s 424A in that it did not provide the appellant with particulars in writing of certain information which forms part of the Tribunal's reasons for affirming the delegate's decision.
 In effect, the "information" was the absence in the file of any record of an earlier protection visa application. 7 The Tribunal recorded in its reasons for decision that it had before it the appellant's Departmental file.
 It did not, at that point in its reasons, say it had read the file, although it did say it "had regard to the material referred to in the delegate's decision, and other material available to it from a range of sources".
 Indeed the solicitor representing the appellant conceded before the Tribunal that material concerning the earlier protection visa was on the Departmental file, which suggests that the Tribunal's reference to there being "no evidence" was not based on an examination of the file.
