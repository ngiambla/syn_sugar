 (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT) 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of a Federal Magistrate, SZCDR v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 1766.
 His Honour gave judgment on 29 November 2005 dismissing the application before him as an abuse of the process of the court and making orders preventing the applicants from initiating, without the leave of the court, further proceedings to review the decision of the delegate of the respondent ('the Minister') dated 14 November 2003 and the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 5 February 2004 and handed down on 25 February 2004. 2 His Honour set out at paragraphs [2] to [7] of his judgment the procedural history of the various matters in which the applicants have sought relief in addition to the two decisions expressly referred to in his Honour's order.
 As Hayne J, giving the judgment of himself and Callinan J, said in those reasons: 'In none of the applications and in none of the material filed in support was there any attempt to identify a sufficient legal or factual basis in the particular case for any of the contentions or to relate the complaints made to what happened in the courts below or in the Tribunal which in any event in each case appears to us to have been entirely orthodox and untainted by any discernible error. ' 4 The Federal Magistrate noted that what was sought to be done before him in the decision, the subject of this application, was to challenge the original decision of the delegate of the Minister notwithstanding that they had proceeded with a merits review before the Refugee Review Tribunal that had been the subject of the decision of the Tribunal given in February 2004. 5 The Full Court of this Court in Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344 at 352-354 [28] - [32] held that where there had been a merits review of the original decision-maker's decision the right of complaint concerning the procedures by which the original decision-maker's decision was obtained became subsumed in the merits review and that it was only errors it the reviewer's decision-making process that were amenable to judicial review on an application such as the present: see too Twist v Randwick Municipal Council [1976] HCA 58 ; (1976) 136 CLR 106 at 116. 6 The applicants were notified by a letter from the registry dated 23 February 2006 that the matter was for hearing today.
