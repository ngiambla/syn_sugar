 Unwin seeks to deal with the extent to which the identified condition might be ameliorated or alleviated by reference to or through the use by the Applicant of the assistance dogs.
 Unwin has expressed his opinion and whether the expression of those views can sit comfortably with either a failure to observe either of the dogs in question or with a failure to observe the behavioural interaction between either of the dogs and Mr Forest but it is correct to say those are matters which ought to be put to Dr.
 Unwin's examination, reaches diagnostic conclusions about that matter and then seeks to comment upon, as a matter of therapeutic consequence, whether the use of an assistance dog would alleviate the condition thus diagnosed. 6 Mr Forest is a self-represented litigant and I have elected to record these observations in addressing for Mr Forest the concerns he has raised by his Notice of Motion concerning the report. 7 I propose to dismiss the Notice of Motion in each proceeding and the costs of each Notice of Motion are reserved.
