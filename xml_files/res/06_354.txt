 I was informed from the bar table that Telstra has masked 697 documents as partially irrelevant, while the applicants have masked 1,879 documents for the same reason. 4 Mr Sheahan SC, on behalf of the applicants, recognises that masking for irrelevance is specifically contemplated by the discovery orders.
 Since I assume that the applicants would have brought to my attention virtually all the cases of inappropriate, or possibly inappropriate, masking of which they are aware, I would regard the fifteen examples they identify as demonstrating a relatively low error rate on the part of Telstra.
