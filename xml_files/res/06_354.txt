 I was informed from the bar table that Telstra has masked 697 documents as partially irrelevant, while the applicants have masked 1,879 documents for the same reason. 4 Mr Sheahan SC, on behalf of the applicants, recognises that masking for irrelevance is specifically contemplated by the discovery orders.
 He also recognises that, while an unqualified order for discovery may require a party to produce unmasked copies of all partially relevant documents unless the Court grants relief from the requirement, it was appropriate for Telstra in the present case to mask the truly irrelevant portions of discovered documents: cf Gray v Associated Book Publishers (Aust) Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1045 , at [9], [14]-[15], per Branson J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 353 , at [12]-[13], per Selway J; Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA 1335 , at [16] ff, per Sundberg J, and authorities cited there. 5 Mr Sheahan says, however, that Telstra has frequently masked not only irrelevant material, but material that is directly relevant to issues in the proceedings.
 Since I assume that the applicants would have brought to my attention virtually all the cases of inappropriate, or possibly inappropriate, masking of which they are aware, I would regard the fifteen examples they identify as demonstrating a relatively low error rate on the part of Telstra.
