 Relevantly it provides that: "the Court may ... make ... (d) an order extending the period for doing any act, matter or thing or instituting or taking any proceeding under this Act or in relation to a corporation".
 No longer is there a reference to the period that may be extended or abridged as being a period that is fixed by the Act or by the rules or regulations made under the Act.
 The power which the court is relevantly given is to "make an order extending the period for doing any act ... in relation to a corporation. " Although poorly drafted I think it is clear that the power cannot be read literally.
