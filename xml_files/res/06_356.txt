 Davis sworn 23 March 2006 and Mr Hal Jones sworn 22 March 2006. 7 A number of exhibits to those affidavits have also been put in evidence; they are exhibit WJ1 to Mr Jacobson's affidavit, exhibits HJ1, HJ2 and HJ3 to Mr Jones' affidavit and exhibit WRL2 to Mr Lonergan's affidavit. 8 Also in evidence is a letter from ASIC dated 24 March 2006 which sets out ASICs policy in relation to the provision of a letter under s 411(17) of the Act .
 I note also that the evidence includes a letter from the Washington Post Company dated 10 March 2006 in which that company unconditionally undertakes to Kaplan to provide Kaplan with the scheme consideration. 10 One other matter which I raised with Mr Oakes is that the scheme provides for a takeover of the scheme company which could have proceeded under the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Act . 11 In Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [24.060] the authors set out the authorities which have considered this question.
