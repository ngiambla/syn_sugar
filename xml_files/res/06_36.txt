 The remaining respondents failed to comply with the Registrar's orders relating to discovery. 11 On 1 December 2003, Ms Wu filed a notice of motion, returnable on 16 December 2003, seeking orders that the respondents file and serve their lists of documents.
 Ms Wu served these orders by mailing them on 11 June 2004 to the respondents' address for service, but she was unable to inspect the respondents' discovered documents pursuant to this order. 17 On 4 August 2004, Ms Wu filed the notice of motion that is the subject of these reasons.
 This expectation was not fulfilled. 18 The motion was subsequently heard on 13 October 2004, 8 December 2004, and 27 April 2005. 19 On 13 October 2004, the respondents appeared by counsel who informed the Court that he was instructed by Geoffrey Grantham Associates.
 The Registrar ordered, amongst other things, that any party wishing to inspect the documents produced under subpoena should contact the Registry on three days' notice and that the reasonable costs of production of the documents be paid by the respondents and taxed in default of agreement.
