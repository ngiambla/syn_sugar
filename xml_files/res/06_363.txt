 Misidentification and miscuing are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer choice; misinference and misassociation are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer judgement. 30.1 Misidentification is when consumers seeking to buy Cadbury chocolate mistakenly identify a Darrell Lea product as a Cadbury product, and therefore buy the Darrell Lea product by mistake.
 Harm to Cadbury from misidentification can take the form of sales lost to Darrell Lea, induced 'trailing' of Darrell Lea's products, blame from consumers for the confusing common use of colour by the two brands, and damaged consumer attitudes toward Cadbury due to cognitive dissonance [a state of discomfort produced by inconsistencies between simultaneously held beliefs or between beliefs and behaviour] or due to violated expectations.
 This line of authority is consistent with the earlier High Court common law decision in Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; (1961) 108 CLR 642 at 649. 8 Nonetheless, Dr Gibbs' evidence is inadmissible because, in the words of Lawton LJ in R v Turner [1975] QB 834 at 841, "An expert's opinion is admissible to furnish the court with scientific information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury. " 9 In Murphy v The Queen [1989] HCA 28 ; (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 111 Mason CJ and Toohey J said that Lawton LJ "...expressed the basis upon which expert evidence is received in terms about which there can be no quarrel. " See also Quick v Stoland Pty Ltd (1998) 87 FCR 371 at 382 (Finklestein J). 10 As Ligertwood says ( Australian Evidence , 4 th ed, 2004, at 494) s 79 has been construed in a way "very close to the common law approach".
