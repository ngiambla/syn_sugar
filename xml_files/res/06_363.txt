 Misidentification and miscuing are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer choice; misinference and misassociation are errors relating, respectively, to conscious and unconscious processes of consumer judgement. 30.1 Misidentification is when consumers seeking to buy Cadbury chocolate mistakenly identify a Darrell Lea product as a Cadbury product, and therefore buy the Darrell Lea product by mistake.
 Harm to Cadbury from misidentification can take the form of sales lost to Darrell Lea, induced 'trailing' of Darrell Lea's products, blame from consumers for the confusing common use of colour by the two brands, and damaged consumer attitudes toward Cadbury due to cognitive dissonance [a state of discomfort produced by inconsistencies between simultaneously held beliefs or between beliefs and behaviour] or due to violated expectations.
 Harm to Cadbury from these errors may take the form of reduced Cadbury reputation and leverage in the distribution channel (retailers), reduced valuations of the Cadbury brand (investors), and reduced morale in the Cadbury workforce (employees). 31.2 The use of purple by Darrell Lea is likely to reduce the perceptual distinctiveness of Cadbury products, and this may also cause harm to Cadbury in the form of lost sales.
