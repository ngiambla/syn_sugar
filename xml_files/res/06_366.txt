 That company operated as a central treasury, employed the staff for the group operations and provided accounting services, information technology services and management services to the other companies in the Westpoint Group. 6 Westpoint Corporation was placed into liquidation on the application of the Commission by order of this Court made on 16 February 2006 on the grounds of insolvency.
 The Commission submits that on the basis of this evidence, the first and second defendants are to be treated as directors of the mezzanine companies within the meaning of s 9 of the Act. 13 The fifth to eighth defendants are companies related to the first defendant which are not under external administration.
 It is said that the fifth defendant has entered into a contract for the sale of the units for a total of $7.1 million and that at settlement due to take place on 31 March 2006, there will be surplus funds payable to the fifth defendant of approximately $3 million, after the repayment of the first mortgage. 25 Mr Zohar says that his investigations reveal that the fifth defendant borrowed $4.1 million from the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation to purchase the units and that funds provided by Westpoint Corporation were used to service the repayment of that loan.
