 Under O 52 r 15(2) the Court or a Judge 'for special reasons' may give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal out of time. 4 In Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479 at 480, McHugh J, citing Hughes v National Trustees Executors Agency Co of Australia Ltd [1978] VR 257 at 262 observed that the discretion to extend time for an appeal was for 'the sole purpose of enabling the court [or a judge] to do justice between the parties' and stated, in that context, it is always necessary to consider the prospects of success.
 The hearing of the matter came on after directions were given for the filing of evidence and the applicant had the opportunity to file, and did file, four affidavits between 11 May and 20 October 2005 when his application was heard by the primary judge.
 The remaining grounds in the draft notice do not raise proper grounds of appeal. 9 However, as the applicant is self-represented, it is appropriate to consider whether there is any arguable ground that the judgment of the primary judge was attended with appellable error. 10 The basis on which the application was dismissed by the primary judge was that the material filed by the applicant contained allegations and assertions, rather than relevant and admissible evidence upon which it was appropriate for the Court to act.
