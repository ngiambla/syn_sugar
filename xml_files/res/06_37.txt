 And any other remedy the Court will allow. " 6 The primary judge considered the material filed by or on behalf of the applicant and concluded (at [15]): "... there is no evidence before the Court which would justify it inquiring into the conduct of the trustee with a view to considering his removal.
 The hearing of the matter came on after directions were given for the filing of evidence and the applicant had the opportunity to file, and did file, four affidavits between 11 May and 20 October 2005 when his application was heard by the primary judge.
 The remaining grounds in the draft notice do not raise proper grounds of appeal. 9 However, as the applicant is self-represented, it is appropriate to consider whether there is any arguable ground that the judgment of the primary judge was attended with appellable error. 10 The basis on which the application was dismissed by the primary judge was that the material filed by the applicant contained allegations and assertions, rather than relevant and admissible evidence upon which it was appropriate for the Court to act.
 It was in that context that his Honour concluded that 'there is no evidence before the Court which would justify it inquiring into the conduct of the trustee with a view to considering his removal'. 11 I have considered the material before the primary judge and am satisfied that it was open to his Honour to arrive at the conclusion set out earlier in these reasons and that no arguable error was made by his Honour in doing so.
