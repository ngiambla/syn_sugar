 In that context of authority, the Tribunal thought that '[t]he Complainant and the Deceased Member, for their own purposes, over a period, fashioned a relationship that suited them and they may well have regarded it as the most appropriate marriage for them in all their circumstances' , the Tribunal adding the observation that ' [i]t is even quite arguable that it may have been a "marital relationship" at common law, which is what the Complainant's lawyers seem to have been submitting' .
 The Tribunal's reasoning continued to the effect that for the purposes of the Superannuation Act , s 8A(1) stipulates that there is a 'marital relationship if two people ordinarily lived together as husband and wife on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis at the relevant time, and further that it was ' fairly clear ' that those s 8A(1) terms such as ' ordinarily ', ' lived together ', ' permanent ' and ' bona fide domestic basis ' imported requirements over and above those that may be necessary for an undefined marital relationship, and should not be regarded as merely surplusage.
 There is clear force in those observations. 15 Accordingly the Tribunal reasoned that just as in normal parlance, it seemed to be unlikely that the relationship between the appellant and the deceased member, whereby they occupied separate residences, but saw one another regularly and even slept together on occasions, was one that would normally be described as 'ordinarily living together' , or necessarily 'permanent , or as having a 'bona fide domestic basis' , within par (b) of s 8A(2).
