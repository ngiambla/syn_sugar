 Those grounds of appeal identify no error which could enliven the appellate jurisdiction of the court. 3 In Coal and Allied Operations Pty Limited v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47 ; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at 203-204 [14] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ said: '... a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was error on the part of the primary decision maker.
 That is because statutory provisions conferring appellate powers, even in the case of an appeal by way of rehearing, are construed on the basis that unless there is something to indicate otherwise the power is to be exercised for correction of error. ' 4 The appellant was notified of today's hearing by letter dated 7 March 2006 but did no appear.
 However, the trial judge does not appear to have had addressed to him any argument in relation to s 424A or otherwise as to the availability in law of the Tribunal taking that course which may have been founded only upon material put forward by the appellant in his original claim to the delegate of the respondent but not put forward in his application for review brought in the Tribunal. 7 The appellant's failure to appear today, however, and the fact that he has identified in his grounds of appeal no error are factors which I consider sufficient to warrant the exercise of the power under s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to dismiss the appeal for failure of the appellant to attend at today's callover which is a hearing relating to the appeal. 8 The Minister seeks costs assessed by the court in the sum of $450 in respect of the appeal.
