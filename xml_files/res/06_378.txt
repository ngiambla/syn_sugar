 I asked him why the reasons which his Honour the trial judge gave for dismissing his application summarily on the basis of the Federal Magistrates Court rules disclosed an error of law. 2 The applicant has sought to raise with me the fact that he was a person who feared his life would be in danger when he returned to his country of origin and that he was, in truth, a refugee.
 I adopt the reasons which I gave on 1 March 2006, before I had the benefit of hearing the applicant, as explaining the reasons in law why I am of opinion that there would be no sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave on the basis of the material before me today and I am not satisfied that there would be any injustice caused to the applicant, let alone a substantial injustice by my refusing him leave to appeal. 5 The applicant says that because of his impecuniosity he ought not be ordered to pay costs of his failed application.
