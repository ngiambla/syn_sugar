 1 The present application filed on 1 December 2005 is for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from the judgment of Smith FM delivered on 8 November 2005, whereby his Honour found that the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 17 June 2005 adversely to the present applicant was not affected by jurisdictional error. 2 The background to that application is that the applicant had arrived in Australia as a visitor from China in November 2004, and had been taken into detention some weeks after her arrival for what were considered to be breaches of her visa.
 Her visa application was refused by the Minister's delegate on 10 March 2005, and her application to the Refugee Review Tribunal for review of that decision was subsequently refused on 17 June 2005, pursuant to a decision bearing date 16 June 2005. 3 Thereafter the applicant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision from the Federal Magistrates Court, and upon the basis of comprehensive reasons for judgment, Federal Magistrate Smith dismissed the application upon the basis that the Tribunal's decision was not affected by any jurisdictional error, and was thus a ' privative clause decision' within s 474(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 In those proceedings, the applicant was legally represented. 4 The applicant filed a supporting affidavit in this Court, presumably handwritten by another person on her behalf, which sought to explain the reasons for her delay in making the present application, and in which she detailed her practice of the Falun Gong religion in China.
 Following upon my adjourning the Court to hear another matter and thus to allow the applicant some time for composure, the applicant was still unable to articulate orally anything approaching a viable basis for an appeal against the Federal Magistrate's decision, assuming that leave to appeal out of time might be granted.
