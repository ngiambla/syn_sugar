 Rather, at the first hearing of this matter on 20 September 2004, the key question was whether the Commonwealth was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond or only for compensable loss: see Inspector General in Bankruptcy v Bradshaw [2005] FCA 424 ( Bradshaw 1) at [10] and following. 3 At the first hearing, the Commonwealth did not attempt to prove any costs incurred in relation to the investigation and prosecution of the first respondent.
 In order for there to be an indemnity costs order, the respondents must show that the applicants' rejection of their offer was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs: see, e.g., Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at 287-290 per Hely J.
 In my view, the rejection of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances because, as at 28 June 2005 (after the directions hearing of 8 June 2005), the applicants should have appreciated that they would not be able to quantify the Commonwealth's loss unless granted leave to reopen their case, and that there were serious doubts that such leave would be forthcoming.
