 In order for there to be an indemnity costs order, the respondents must show that the applicants' rejection of their offer was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs: see, e.g., Port Kembla Coal Terminal Ltd v Braverus Maritime Inc (No 2) (2004) 212 ALR 281 at 287-290 per Hely J.
 In my view, the rejection of the Calderbank offer was unreasonable in all the circumstances because, as at 28 June 2005 (after the directions hearing of 8 June 2005), the applicants should have appreciated that they would not be able to quantify the Commonwealth's loss unless granted leave to reopen their case, and that there were serious doubts that such leave would be forthcoming.
