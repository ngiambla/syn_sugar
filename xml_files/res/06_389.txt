 The grievance stems from his concern that the Tribunal has not dealt with a complaint he lodged with it to the effect that the trustee of his superannuation fund has not credited his superannuation accounts with the correct figures. 2 Mr David filed an application under s 7(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) in this Court.
 The only delays which occurred between the lodging of the complaint and the filing of the application arose as a consequence of the time taken for the trustee to respond to the Tribunal's requests for information. 9 For the above reasons, I consider that the Federal Magistrate made no legal error in dismissing Mr David's application under s 7 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).
