 The application for a protection visa 6 Before the Federal Magistrate, Mr Hirsch submitted that the visa application was not "filled in" as required by s 98 of the Act and was not "completed" as required by Regulation 2.07(3) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth).
 The residential address details given for the appellant were false and were not authorised by him and much of the detail of the protection visa claims made in the purported visa application were inventions of the agent and were not authorised by the appellant.
 It was a false application but it was, in formal terms, a valid application ( NAWZ at [16]-[18]). 13 In different ways, the appellant asserts that there was no authorisation of the specific visa application and that, consequently, it was not valid.
