 In the period of time between decision and application for review, the appellant had sought a discretionary decision from the first respondent and had joined a class action in the High Court, his involvement in which ceased on 20 June 2003.
 That finding has not been shown to be in error. 8 The appellant was not aware of a ground included in his application, that the Tribunal had failed to refer him to a psychologist, because someone else had completed his application.
 It was for that reason and because the appropriate time to consider the effect of the appellant's delay in the prosecution of his application to review the Tribunal's decision was on the hearing of the appeal, that his Honour granted the extension of time.
