 The representations included that a licence fee of $60,000 was only payable in certain circumstances, that Contact Plus had a right to payment of the lump sum licence fee of $60,000 when no such right existed, that licensed marketing databases were "fully qualified" when they were not, and representing on its website that Contact Plus would allocate a franchisee with an exclusive area when the terms of the agreement provided otherwise. 4 The ACCC made it clear from the outset that it would be seeking a declaration that the licence agreements were franchise agreements, and therefore subject to the Code.
 On 15 September 2005, leave was granted to the ACCC to file an amended application and statement of claim joining CPG Recruitment Pty Ltd ("CPG"), the third respondent, to this proceeding. 6 Following a mediation held on 24 November 2005, the ACCC, Mr Spencer, and CPG agreed to the making of certain declarations, findings of fact, and injunctions.
 In addition, he submits that the ACCC acted in an unreasonable and high-handed manner, and therefore should not be entitled to recover any costs against him. 9 In broad terms, the Federal Court Rules provide that where a party discontinues proceedings without the leave of the Court, the discontinuing party is liable to pay costs, unless the Court orders otherwise: see O 22 r 2 and 3, and O 62 r 26(1).
