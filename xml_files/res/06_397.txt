 I am prepared to infer that the nature and sequence of the transfers effected by Siminton, and his attempt to withdraw a significant amount of cash from an account with which he had no previous association, were an attempt by Siminton to avoid detection by APRA.
 That observation is made on the assumption that the $574 000 transferred to the Bendigo Bank account (of which Siminton attempted to withdraw $500 000) is still within the direct protection of the Sundberg J orders. 5 Because of the belated compliance by Siminton with the Sundberg J orders in relation to posting notices on the two websites, the website contempts are less serious.
 I observed in Australian Industry Group v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union [2000] FCA 629 at [79] that the rule of law in a democratic society does not permit any member of the society to pick and choose the laws or court orders that are to be observed and those that are not.
