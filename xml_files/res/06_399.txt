 What Mr Gillard puts in this case as the good reason for transfer is, in his submission, the fact that the communications between the parties for the establishment of what is said to be the joint venture consists of documents which were communicated between the respondent's offices in Brisbane and the applicant's offices in the United States.
 Accordingly, all of the respondent's documents are now located in Brisbane. 17 It is possible that some of the documents were originally in Darwin, which is where the project was undertaken, but the evidence establishes, as I understand it, that any documents of the respondents that were located in Darwin are now to be found in Brisbane. 18 Mr Gillard points to the fact that in the application the applicant seeks an order for inspection of all relevant documents which are defined in very wide terms in a note to the application.
 It does seem to me that the question of location of documents would not ordinarily be a good reason for exercising my discretion under s 48 to change the venue of the proceedings. 24 It would be just as inconvenient for the applicant to have to move its documents to Brisbane as for the respondents to bring the documents from Brisbane to Sydney.
