 The question that arises under s 440A , therefore, is whether it is in the interests of creditors that the seven creditors mentioned should be able to subject the Commissioner and Sensis to the proposed DCA regime, and that the Commissioner and Sensis should be subjected to that regime. 9 When s 440A speaks of 'the interests of creditors' it is referring to the creditors' interests as creditors, that is to say, to their interests in recovering what is owed to them, not to 'interests' arising from family relationships, friendship or emotional attachment.
 In addition, there is annexed to Mr Wily's affidavit a letter from Mr Brickwood which states, in substance, that he has no assets. 16 No doubt there may be problems for a liquidator, but the matters raised in the Administrators' report probably warrant further investigation.
 Prima facie, the Company was entitled to receive $175,000 and this entitlement would enure for the benefit of its creditors. 18 According to Mr Wily's affidavit of today, however, his further inquiries indicate that the Company held the shareholding as trustee for the Brickwood Family Investment Trust, of which the Company was formerly the trustee.
