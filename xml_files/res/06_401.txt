 1 This is an application by Ms Loris Johnston ('the applicant') for an extension of time to file and serve a Notice of Appeal from the decision of Federal Magistrate Jarrett made on 30 September 2005, wherein the learned Federal Magistrate refused an order that the applicant's bankruptcy be annulled pursuant to s 153B Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act'). 2 The respondent to this application is the petitioning creditor to the bankruptcy of the applicant.
 A sequestration order was made against the applicant, based on this creditor's petition, on 18 May 2005. 18 In applying to Jarrett FM to have her bankruptcy annulled, the applicant's first ground was that she had never been served with the second creditor's petition.
 I am also prepared to accept the claim of the applicant that she believed that she needed the funds from her Centrelink payment to pay the filing fee for lodgement of the notice. 28 In my view, the key question is whether, prima facie , the merit of the applicant's case is such that the Court should exercise its discretion to allow additional time to file a notice of appeal.
 The applicant has also sought to demonstrate that her income exceeded her expenditure during the period when the sequestration order was made, and indeed the applicant has claimed that she had estimated gross annual earnings net of expenses of $90 000 (TS p 23 ll 35-38).
