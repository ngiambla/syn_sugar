 The fact that they were relied upon by the plaintiff in seeking ex parte orders and that the defendants had not had an opportunity to respond was not a relevant consideration in determining the issue of access for reporting purposes. 15 It was submitted that access to the affidavits will ensure a complete report of the proceedings will be made.
 The point of departure adopted by his Honour was the proposition stated by the Full Court in R v Davis (1995) 57 FCR 412 at 514: 'Whatever [the media's] motives in reporting, their opportunity to do so arises out of a principle that is fundamental to our society and method of government: except in extraordinary circumstances, the courts of the land are open to the public.
 In my view, that is so important a consideration that, unless there is some specific or obvious prejudice of another kind, the mere consideration of prematurity, in the sense that the plaintiff's evidence has not been tested or answered, is insufficient to prevent the Court from making available to outsiders, including in particular the media, the affidavits relied upon in ex parte circumstances leading to significant relief. ' Whether access should be given 21 The question whether affidavit evidence relied upon in ex parte proceedings may or may not be admissible in later proceedings or in criminal or penalty proceedings has little bearing, of itself, on the question of access.
 And as the transcripts are in evidence, if only for the purpose of the ex parte application, all parties to the proceedings have the right to see them and to discuss them in an unfettered way with their advisors. 24 In my opinion the objections taken by the defendants to the inspection of the affidavits relied upon in these proceedings thus far are generic in character and do not identify any particular basis upon which I should refuse access to them. 25 As to affidavits subsequently filed and not yet in evidence, I will not allow access until after the hearing tomorrow when their status as evidence or otherwise is clarified.
