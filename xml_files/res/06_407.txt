 John Fairfax Holdings Limited, Nationwide News Ltd and West Australian Newspapers Ltd have leave to inspect the following documents filed in these proceedings: (i) The affidavits of Richard Warren Gomm sworn on 29 March 2006. (ii) The affidavit of Oran Zohar sworn on 29 March 2006. (iii) The affidavit of Kevin Chin sworn on 30 March 2006. (iv) The affidavit of Marcus Essex Claridge sworn on 30 March 2006.
 Siopis J made interim asset preservation orders and incidental orders affecting the ability of the defendants to leave Australia at the conclusion of the hearing on 30 March 2006 and published his reasons for those orders on 5 April 2006. 4 In publishing the reasons his Honour referred to the affidavit material before him and referred specifically to evidence in the affidavits of Messrs Zohar, Gomm and Chin.
 It is therefore at least arguable that Mr Chin's affidavit in so far as it annexes transcripts of examinations and deals with matters by reference to those transcripts, is inadmissible. 9 It is further submitted on behalf of the third and fourth defendants that they are not now in a position to make detailed submissions regarding all affidavits in the proceedings and that any determination of the question of access by the media to the affidavits should await the hearing listed for Wednesday 12 April 2006. 10 On behalf of the media organisations requesting access it was submitted that the principle of the open administration of justice requires that the proceedings be conducted in public which in turn enables fair and accurate reports of the proceedings to be published.
 Reliance was placed upon s 68(2) of the ASIC Act in that respect. 12 In answer to the contention that the transcripts should not be available for inspection because ss 22 and 25 of the ASIC Act had indicated a legislative intention to protect the secrecy of the examination, it was submitted that the fact a process conducted under statute prescribes privacy does not mean that privacy prevails when the matter becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the Court. 13 Suggestions that the release of the affidavit material would prejudice future criminal or civil proceedings were said to be merely speculative and irrelevant to the determination of access.
 The fact that they were relied upon by the plaintiff in seeking ex parte orders and that the defendants had not had an opportunity to respond was not a relevant consideration in determining the issue of access for reporting purposes. 15 It was submitted that access to the affidavits will ensure a complete report of the proceedings will be made.
 As few members of the public have the time, or even the inclination, to attend courts in person, in a practical sense this principle demands that the media be free to report what goes on in them. ' His Honour referred to other authorities to like effect. 17 Open justice was described in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court [2005] NSWCA 101 by Spigelman CJ as a principle and not 'a free-standing right'.
 Nevertheless, it is clear that there will be a far stronger case for access by the public to affidavits which form part of the evidence before the Court than there will be to affidavits which are not in evidence. 18 I agree, with respect, with the following observation by Sackville J at [27]: '...unless the interests of justice require otherwise, this Court would ordinarily take the view that a non-party should have access to all non-confidential documents and other material admitted into evidence.
 In particular, access to the documentary evidence can be expected to be helpful to a person seeking to understand or explain the proceedings, or to evaluate the court's determination of the issues arising the proceedings (cf Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), ss 55 , 56 (stating the test of relevance)). ' His Honour went on to say that in exercising the discretion conferred by O 46 r 6(iv) he considered that considerable weight should be given to the principle of open justice. 19 In that case however, his Honour recognised that there was a significant risk that if non-confidential exhibits were released to the media as soon as they were admitted into evidence some parties might be subjected to a forensic disadvantage.
 Thus the publication in the media of the substance of some exhibits might deprive a party of a legitimate forensic advantage when it came to cross-examination of particular witnesses. 20 In connection with ex parte proceedings I refer also to the observation by Austin J in Rich at [26] that: 'The principle of open justice entails, in my view, that when the Court makes quite significant orders on an ex parte application, the basis for the making of those orders must be available so that the court is accountable for what it has done after it has considered the information provided to it.
 In my view, that is so important a consideration that, unless there is some specific or obvious prejudice of another kind, the mere consideration of prematurity, in the sense that the plaintiff's evidence has not been tested or answered, is insufficient to prevent the Court from making available to outsiders, including in particular the media, the affidavits relied upon in ex parte circumstances leading to significant relief. ' Whether access should be given 21 The question whether affidavit evidence relied upon in ex parte proceedings may or may not be admissible in later proceedings or in criminal or penalty proceedings has little bearing, of itself, on the question of access.
 And as the transcripts are in evidence, if only for the purpose of the ex parte application, all parties to the proceedings have the right to see them and to discuss them in an unfettered way with their advisors. 24 In my opinion the objections taken by the defendants to the inspection of the affidavits relied upon in these proceedings thus far are generic in character and do not identify any particular basis upon which I should refuse access to them. 25 As to affidavits subsequently filed and not yet in evidence, I will not allow access until after the hearing tomorrow when their status as evidence or otherwise is clarified.
