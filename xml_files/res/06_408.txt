 The visa had an expiry date of 15 March 2004. 5 The appellant enrolled in a course of secondary education at Eltham College for the academic years 2002 and 2003. 6 Semester 1 in 2003 commenced on 3 February 2003 and concluded on 27 June 2003. 7 On 4 June 2003, Eltham College sent the appellant a notice under s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth).
 The s 20 notice advised the appellant, amongst other things, that he had breached a condition of his student visa relating to course attendance requirements. 8 In response to the s 20 notice, the appellant attended the office of the respondent Minister's department in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne on 23 June 2003.
 At the material time condition 8202 relevantly provided: (1) The holder...must meet the requirements of subclasses (2) and (3). (2) A holder meets the requirements of his subclause if: ... (b) in the case of the holder of Subclass 560 ... visa who is an exchange student - the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study... 3.
 Breach of visa condition 8202. " 12 Earlier in June 2003, Eltham College had notified the department that the appellant was not enrolled at the College as at 11 June 2003, as the appellant had left school on 10 June 2003. 13 After interviewing the appellant on 3 October 2003, the delegate cancelled the visa under s 116(1)(b) and (3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 It further observed that, on his own evidence, the appellant either did not enrol in that other course or had enrolled but did not pay fees. 17 Before the Tribunal the appellant took issue with the accuracy of the attendance records provided by Eltham College.
 Therefore, to calculate a percentage of classes attended was to calculate a percentage of contact hours attended. " 22 His Honour then noted the appellant's submission that the Tribunal had not taken into account other activities at the College in assessing attendance, such as School Assessed Coursework.
 Counsel further submitted that the Tribunal erred by disregarding the effect of the alleged statement of the delegate that the applicant was not permitted to study in Australia. 26 Counsel for the Minister submitted that "contact hours" in condition 8202 refers to the proportion of required contact hours attended by the student.
 Counsel stated in his written outline of submissions that Quan : "...was a case in which there was no inquiry made as to the number of classes attended, and the decision rested on a simplistic calculation based on the number of days the visa holder had not attended school. " 27 Counsel for the Minister calculated from the attendance records before the Tribunal that "expressed as a proportion of the total number of classes the appellant was required to attend in term 1, [of 2003] his attendance was less that the required 80%".
 He also contended that the appellant could not have been taken by surprise by the findings that he was not enrolled in course of study and was not the beneficiary of certificate of satisfactory completion of study as each matter was an incontrovertible fact.
 In other words, the failure of the Tribunal to inform the appellant that the visa could be cancelled as a consequence of a lack of certification of successful completion of his course did not affect the outcome of the review.
 Furthermore, the lack of certification was something so obvious that it need not have been stated and was a vital requirement for satisfaction of condition 8202. 34 The appeal ground relating to the Tribunal's consideration of whether the applicant was engaged in study, rather than whether he was enrolled in a course, was not developed further in oral submissions before the Court.
 On that view alone, Morsed is distinguishable. 37 In any event, the cancellation of the student visa in Morsed arose as a result of the automatic effect of s 137J of the Migration Act , consequent upon a s 20 notice.
