 At [14], his Honour said: "The reasonable reading of them is that the tribunal considered that when the College records and other material showed that the [appellant] was absent from a class, that meant he missed the class, not that he was there for part of the class.
 Counsel further submitted that the Tribunal erred by disregarding the effect of the alleged statement of the delegate that the applicant was not permitted to study in Australia. 26 Counsel for the Minister submitted that "contact hours" in condition 8202 refers to the proportion of required contact hours attended by the student.
 He also contended that the appellant could not have been taken by surprise by the findings that he was not enrolled in course of study and was not the beneficiary of certificate of satisfactory completion of study as each matter was an incontrovertible fact.
 Furthermore, the lack of certification was something so obvious that it need not have been stated and was a vital requirement for satisfaction of condition 8202. 34 The appeal ground relating to the Tribunal's consideration of whether the applicant was engaged in study, rather than whether he was enrolled in a course, was not developed further in oral submissions before the Court.
