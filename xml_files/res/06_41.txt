 GROUNDS TWO AND THREE: MRS HINDS' KNOWLEDGE 27 Ground two asserts that his Honour should have found that Mr Ross' correction of the turnover on 8 January 2004 did not remove the effect of the earlier misrepresentation because neither the appellants or alternatively Mrs Hinds understood the true position concerning turnover after the Meeting.
 Even if Mrs Hinds did not make the complaint at the meeting at the business, it is submitted by the appellants that could not reasonably justify drawing a conclusion adverse to her credibility in circumstances where she had already made a complaint concerning the issue to Mr Featherston.
 GROUND 12: PREFERENCE OF MR ROSS' EVIDENCE 66 Ground 12 asserts his Honour erred in fact and in law in preferring Mr Ross' evidence to Mr Featherston's as to the existence of other potential purchasers to whom Mr Ross showed figures of the business. 67 At [93] his Honour stated that the existence of the 'other potential purchasers' referred to by Mr Featherston and to whom Mr Ross allegedly showed figures, was not put to Mr Ross.
