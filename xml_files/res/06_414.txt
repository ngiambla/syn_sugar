 1 The respondent brings a notice of motion seeking taxation of costs of interlocutory proceedings. 2 On 28 April 2005, orders were made that the respondent's notice of motion filed on 20 August 2004 and the applicant's notice of motion filed on 14 June 2004 be dismissed by consent.
 In Harris , Kiefel J accepted that an order that certain costs be taxed and paid forthwith was justified in circumstances where there had been a long delay in the course of the proceeding by the pursuit of an ill-considered and unnecessary claim.
 In other words, when the orders of 28 April 2005 were made, the original application had been on foot for over 12 months. 11 Although the proceeding is due to be heard in the first week of May, time will be required for preparation and publication of reasons.
