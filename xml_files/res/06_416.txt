 Decisions such as these are routine and are not proper bases for disqualifying the trial judge. 12 Similar considerations apply to Mr Spalla's complaints about my rulings concerning the admissibility of his affidavit of 1 June 2005 and his application for leave to amend further his notice of motion.
 This covered much of the proposed amendments. 14 Be this as it may, the mere fact a litigant does not gain rulings in his or her favour in the course of a trial does not reasonably create an apprehension of bias on the part of a fair-minded lay observer.
 Further, at the time junior counsel informed the Court that his retainer and that of his instructor had been terminated, I sought to remind Mr Spalla of his responsibilities as a litigant. 17 It must be borne steadily in mind that as the judge in this case I have a duty to both Mr Spalla and the respondents to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly and in as timely a fashion as possible.
