 The respondents cross appealed against my order setting aside the decision of the Committee. 5 The decision of the Full Court on the appeal was handed down on 16 September 2005; see Oreb v Willcock [2005] FCAFC 196 (" Oreb " ). 6 Dr Oreb's appeal against my findings in relation to the investigative referral and the adjudicative referral was dismissed.
 Subject to issues raised in the constitutional argument, and except for the 'racial issue' in the two Lee matters (N568/03 and N1430/03), all of the parties in the remaining proceedings (Wong, Do, Ho, Lee, Lee and Bartos) accept that the outcome of the proceedings turn solely upon the result of the appeal in Oreb (being an appeal of the judgment contained in Oreb v Willcock [2004] FCA 1520). 4.
 The concession was expressed in Order 3 and I propose to treat it as such. 43 The concession was that as to those matters which fell into the second tranche for hearing in the week commencing 6 December 2004, there were no issues of fact or law which would not be determined by the result of the appeal in Oreb . 44 In particular, it was implicit in the concession made on behalf of the applicants that, in relation to the "exceptional circumstances" question, the remaining proceedings were on all fours with the matter of Oreb .
