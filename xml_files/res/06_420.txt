 1 On 6 December 2005, the applicant filed in this Court an application invoking the jurisdiction conferred on the Court by s 170CP(1) and (2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Workplace Relations Act ').
 The reason given for the dismissal at the time was that, for the purposes of gaining employment, the applicant had made a statutory declaration in which he declared that he did not have any convictions, findings of guilt, or pending charges of a non-traffic nature in Victoria, or any other State of Australia, or under Commonwealth law.
 That is to say, it would be necessary for the respondent to prove on the balance of probabilities that whoever made the decision to dismiss the applicant from his employment did not have as a reason for that decision the applicant's political opinion, or his national extraction or social origin.
