 The MRT was not satisfied that, at the time of application, the nominator suffered from a prolonged illness. 8 The MRT also concluded that that the nominator did not require assistance because of "other serious circumstances" at the time of application.
 Citing Hussein v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1621 (" Hussein "), the MRT stated that it was "not satisfied that the nominator's concerns for the safety of the visa applicant manifest a need for assistance due to circumstances serious enough to reach the threshold set by 'death, prolonged illness or disability'".
 Citing Wu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1817 ; (2000) 105 FCR 39 (" Wu ") per Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ, the appellant argued that the MRT mistakenly applied Hussein when it held that the words "death, disability or prolonged illness" constrain the meaning of "other serious circumstances".
