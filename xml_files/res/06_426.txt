 In particular, the MRT was "not satisfied that the assistance needed could not at the time of the application have reasonably have been obtained from one or more or from a combination of the four other children of the nominator in Australia or from welfare, hospital, nursing or community services in Australia". 7 The MRT made a variety of factual findings that, in its view, supported this conclusion.
 First, she claimed that the learned Federal Magistrate erred in failing to hold that the decision of the MRT involved a jurisdictional error in that the MRT determined whether the appellant was a special need relative at the time of application by reference to events that occurred after that date.
 Thirdly, according to the appellant, paragraph 33, in which these findings appeared, was wrongly concerned with circumstances as at the date of the decision, even though the MRT purported to be ruling on the situation at the date of application. 13 The appellant noted the Federal Magistrate's comment (at [16]) that it was not clear that any error would have affected the MRT's decision because the appellant was required to continue to satisfy the requirements of the visa at the time of decision.
 In these circumstances, it was plainly open to the MRT not to be satisfied that the requisite assistance could not reasonably be obtained from one or more of his other children in Australia or public services. 22 It would be wrong to find error simply because the MRT failed to note explicitly that it was not just considering whether other sources of assistance were available but was directing its attention to whether the nominator could reasonably obtain such assistance.
