 On the findings made by it (in particular at [67] and at [69]), having reviewed and considered for itself the evidence and submissions before it, the Tribunal was authorised by the combined effect of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and s 177F of the 36 Act to affirm the determination made by the respondent.
 The applicant, at para. 25 of his outline of submissions, contended that the capital loss was not a tax benefit connected with the scheme identified by the respondent because there was at all material times a reasonable expectation that a sale of the beneficial ownership in the shares would have occurred in an alternative form or forms.
 So the Tribunal finds for the purposes of s. 177D(a) of the Act that the applicant, as trustee of the trust, obtained a tax benefit connected with the scheme identified by the respondent because, in the circumstances of this matter, it is unreasonable to expect that the applicant would have incurred the capital loss had the scheme not been carried out.
