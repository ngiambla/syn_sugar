 Thus the suggestion in grounds 1 to 3 and 7 of the notice of appeal that s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) was constitutionally invalid, as the Minister submitted, is without merit, the section having been construed on numerous occasions by the Federal Court, and also by the High Court, without any suggestion of, much more authority for, the proposition that the same is invalid, or otherwise violates any limitation or constraint evident in the Constitution .
 Even if the appellant should be allowed to tender these submissions in support of the appeal without notice to the Minister, the reality is that they constituted a purported rehearing of misconceived errors, including errors of law, which exposed no error in the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate's Court below. 16 What the appellant sought to do in reality was an attempt to burden the Court and the Minister with a farrago of misconceptions, wrongful quotations and a fresh hearing of the merits of a case for review of the Tribunal's decision without any basis on the merits, and to ignore the reasons for decision of Emmett FM notwithstanding his purported appeal from her judgment and orders.
