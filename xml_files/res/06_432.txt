 As to the documents comprising DJM1 and ARS1, the concession of counsel for ThoughtWeb Systems on the second day (see (2) above) seems to accept that none of these documents is subject to any implied undertaking proscribing their use for unrelated purposes. (4) "IAM11" --- affidavit of Graham Christopher Oxland Murray sworn 8 December 2004 and Exhibit GCOM1 to that affidavit.
 Counsel for Mr Loughnan conceded that this affidavit had not been read and that neither it nor the report which is MST1 could be used by Mr Loughnan in proceedings to wind up ThoughtWeb Systems. (7) "IAM14" and "IAM15" --- letter dated 15 August 2005 from Dibbs Abbott Stillman to Norman Waterhouse and applicants' outline of submissions on security for costs dated 16 August 2005.
