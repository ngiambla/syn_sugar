 Mr Gomm noted that, of the deposits made into the Westpoint Corporation bank account between 21 November and 25 November 2005, only $381,187.37 came from bank accounts not operated by the Mezzanine Companies. 59 Mr Gomm described two sets of 'round robin' transactions of $1 million each entered into in January 2006.
 Mr Gomm pointed out that the Cinema City Property Trust had not been indebted to the Westpoint Income Fund prior to the substitution of $2 million owing to the Westpoint Income Fund by Lanepoint Enterprises with a loan from the Westpoint Income Fund to the Cinema City Property Trust in that amount.
 These were transactions which, in his opinion, appeared to be designed to remove assets from Westpoint Corporation and some of its associated entities. 67 Following his appointment as one of the Receivers and Managers to Westpoint Corporation, Mr Zohar instructed Tracey Fox to obtain books and records relating to assignments of loans between entities in the Westpoint Group.
