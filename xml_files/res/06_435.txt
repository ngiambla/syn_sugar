 It would render nugatory the purpose identified by the majority in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 for the relevant information to be identified and of communicating to the applicant for review what Hayne J described (215 ALR at 211 [208]) as '... the relevance to the review of the information that is conveyed'.
 I am of opinion that the Tribunal, in coming to its positive finding at [24] of its reasons that the appellant 'elaborated and fabricated his claims to bring himself within the definition of a refugee', took into account what it said was before it, namely all of what was in that file in the applicant's letter accompanying his application for a protection visa.
 As Hayne J said in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 215 ALR at 211 [208], s 424A(2) required the Tribunal to inform the applicant for review, among other things, of the relevance to the review of the information that was conveyed by the information which was extraneous to the application for review. 55 The Minister submitted that it was not necessary for the Tribunal to foreshadow to the appellant any reasoning process which it proposed to adopt in its determination of the application.
