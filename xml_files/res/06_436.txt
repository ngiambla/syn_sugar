 The rich regional oral literature recounts the deeds of many Story-Beings as they fashioned the landscape and its topographic features, and the traditional owners consider that their prerogative of marking and changing the landscape comes to them by their descent from the Stories.
 Many people of all ages know and use the Yidiny / Yidiy words and names for plant and animal species, place names, personal names, etc. and to sing songs in the language. (Rigsby 2002:210) Many place names are also traditional personal names, i.e. they are handed down the generations in family lines.
 We can also regard these traditional names as intellectual property because they are not available for anybody and everybody to bestow and use but only senior traditional owners of the country named can make the decisions and bestow the names.
