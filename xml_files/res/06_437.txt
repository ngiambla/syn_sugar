 However, in Minister for Immigration v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77 at 91 [51] O'Connor and Mansfield JJ held that regulation to be invalid to the extent it sought to impose such time constraints. ) 4 Before the trial judge, ([2006] FMCA 175 at [19]) and also before me, the applicant asserted, without giving evidence, that he had never received any notification of the Tribunal's decision until after he had been detained in 2005 by officers of the respondent's department. 5 It does not appear that his Honour invited the applicant to give evidence to support his assertion of non receipt of the letter of 11 March 1999.
 The draft notice of appeal submitted by the applicant with his affidavit on 7 February 2006 asserts that: (a) the Tribunal failed, in effect, properly to consider his case; and (b) the Tribunal refused to accept that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution. 10 His Honour recorded in his judgment that the applicant was a citizen of China and he had arrived in Australia on 29 October 1997.
