 However, in Minister for Immigration v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77 at 91 [51] O'Connor and Mansfield JJ held that regulation to be invalid to the extent it sought to impose such time constraints. ) 4 Before the trial judge, ([2006] FMCA 175 at [19]) and also before me, the applicant asserted, without giving evidence, that he had never received any notification of the Tribunal's decision until after he had been detained in 2005 by officers of the respondent's department. 5 It does not appear that his Honour invited the applicant to give evidence to support his assertion of non receipt of the letter of 11 March 1999.
 PRINCIPLES FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL 8 The question of whether or not leave to appeal should be given is, of course, governed by well established principles, namely that an applicant for leave must establish that the decision in question is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave and also must show that substantial injustice would result from a refusal of leave to appeal ( Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225 at 231, [29] per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ).
 The draft notice of appeal submitted by the applicant with his affidavit on 7 February 2006 asserts that: (a) the Tribunal failed, in effect, properly to consider his case; and (b) the Tribunal refused to accept that the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution. 10 His Honour recorded in his judgment that the applicant was a citizen of China and he had arrived in Australia on 29 October 1997.
 CONCLUSION 37 Ordinarily, if no additional evidence is admitted under section 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) or Federal Court Rules Order 52 r 36 an appeal and there has been no relevant change in the law, a court or tribunal entertaining an appeal by way of rehearing can exercise its appellate powers only if satisfied that there was an error on the part of the primary decision maker.
