 An injunction pursuant to section 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ") restraining the Respondent, its officers, employees, members or agents or otherwise howsoever, from engaging in secondary boycott action pursuant to section 45D of the Act by: (a) engaging in industrial action [as that term is defined in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth)] with employees working on the Swanview Redevelopment Site in Como ("the Site"); and/or (b) directing and/or causing, constructing, demanding or requesting that the employees working on the Site engage in such industrial action. 2.
 The applicant argued that the determination of the justiciable controversy required the determination of both the applicant's claim and its defence, namely, that the impugned conduct was 'protected action' under the Act and afforded the respondent immunity from the suit brought by the applicant under the TP Act in respect of an alleged breach of s 45D of that Act .
 There was in the proceeding before the High Court no attempt to enforce a duty arising under the Act , and, therefore, there was no need for the High Court to address the question of whether a claim arising under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) (as the Act was then named), or a defence of immunity under that Act , would be included within the scope of 'a matter arising under the Act '. 32 It follows, therefore, that, in my view, the application is a proceeding in a matter arising under the Act with the consequence that s 347 of the Act is applicable.
