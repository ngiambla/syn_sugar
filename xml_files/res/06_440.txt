 The applicants' essential case is that there is an implied agreement or equitable obligation not to use information in the combined database to solicit business from clients who formed part of the applicants' pre-merger client base.
 The applicants' contention is not only that such an obligation exists, but that there is sufficient evidence that it has been breached at least to raise a serious question to be tried. 15 The respondents contend that the applicants have not defined with any precision the confidential information which they seek to protect.
 Finally, the respondents contend that, in any event, even if an obligation can be found to exist on the facts, there is no evidence of any breach of it. 16 For the purposes of this application I do not need to express a view about some of these contentions.
