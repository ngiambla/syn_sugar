 The RRT did not find the applicant's account credible and concluded that neither the applicant nor his mother had been involved with the LTTE. 6 Prior to the RRT's hearing, there had been no suggestion by the applicant that he had any direct involvement with the LTTE.
 Section 424A does not apply to certain kinds of information, being information that is not specifically about an applicant and is just about a class of persons, or information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application, or non-disclosable information: s 424A(3). 20 I will deal first with the issue of country information, which the applicant raised on 10 March 2006.
 The whole of the written reasons must be analysed and interpreted in their context to assess why it was that the Tribunal acted as it did (and so, in the relevant sense, to assess what would be, prior to making the decision, the reason or a part of the reason).
