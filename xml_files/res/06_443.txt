 Dear most honourable and most respected Federal Magistrate Court Judge(s), please make a decision favourable to me. ' 18 Although the Appellant attended a hearing before the Tribunal on 7 June 2005, he did not place a transcript of the evidence given at the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court or before this Court on appeal. 19 A directions hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court took place on 4 August 2005 at which time the Court granted leave to the Appellant to file an amended application by 27 October 2005.
 The proposed Further Amended Application was accompanied by a copy of the Appellant's written submissions in the Federal Magistrates Court, notwithstanding that the directions given by the Court on 4 August 2005 required such written submissions to be provided by 22 November 2005. 22 Absent the provision by the Appellant of his written submissions in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Respondent Minister proceeded to prepare her written submissions in response to the Amended Application filed 7 September 2005, such written submissions being provided on 29 November 2005, in accordance with the directions which had been given on 4 August 2005. 23 On the hearing of the application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 6 December 2005 the Appellant sought leave to rely upon the Further Amended Application, an unsigned copy of which had been filed on 29 November 2005 (four clear working days before the date fixed for the hearing of the matter) in lieu of the Amended Application filed 7 September 2005.
 The Tribunal did not accept the Appellant's claim that he would be returning to China as a known Falun Gong practitioner and face harm from the Chinese authorities for that reason. 62 Given the claims made by the Appellant as to the particular social group of which he claimed to be a member, the Tribunal did not constructively fail to exercise its jurisdiction by failing to consider an inconsistent claim as alleged in ground 2. 63 Ground 3 in the Amended Application is barely comprehensible.
