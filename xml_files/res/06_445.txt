 This consideration is not relevant to the matter of the Applicant insofar as he is a single man and without children. ' 50 Although counsel for the applicant, Mr Ower, conceded there was no evidence before the Deputy President that the applicant had even met Hao, he contended that she would be adversely affected by the deportation of her brother because of the impact such a deportation would have on her parents and, in particular, their ability to parent her.
 In that regard, procedural fairness required the delegate to advise the respondent that if the delegate was not taking the best interests of the children into account as a primary consideration so that the respondent could have an opportunity to persuade the delegate otherwise. 82 Teoh's case was decided prior to Ministerial Direction No. 21.
 In that regard it takes up Article 3.1, at least insofar as any child who has a parental or close relationship with the person under consideration. 83 Because Ministerial Direction No. 21 identifies the class of children whose best interests are required to be a primary consideration in the decision making process, an applicant cannot have a legitimate expectation that the best interests of any other child or children not within that class would be the subject of an assessment by the decision maker considering the application generally.
