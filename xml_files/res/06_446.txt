 The letter stated: "Many consumers would in fact believe that the use of Cadbury's Purple (as referred to in evidence in the recent Federal Court case of Red Bull v Sydneywide Distributors) means that the chocolate used in 'Milk Choc Cooking Buds' chocolate emanates from Cadbury Schweppes.
 Since Cadbury uses many colours other than purple in its marketing the explanation may be that the name Cadbury and chocolate are so dominant in the minds of consumers that with a number of colours there is a tendency to think "if it's chocolate it must be Cadbury's".
 This would have been a transient use, in the most literal sense. 87 I conclude that, for all practical purposes, Cadbury's use of the colour purple in marketing, promotion, advertising, packaging, and point of sale is always associated with the famous name Cadbury.
