 The date by which the appellant was requested to respond was beyond the 14 day "prescribed period" fixed by s 424B(2) of the Act and Reg 4.35(3) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth). 3 Notwithstanding that the additional time provided to the appellant might be thought to have been for his benefit, the Minister concedes that, upon the proper construction of s 424B(2), the RRT's invitation was in breach of that section.
 However, the Minister submits that the decision of the RRT, made after the breach, did not involve jurisdictional error. 4 The only issue which arises on the appeal is whether, in the circumstances, the breach of s 424B(2) involved jurisdictional error on the part of the RRT and, if so, whether the Court ought to exercise its discretion to refuse relief.
 Shortly afterward he applied for a Protection Visa, claiming to have a well founded fear of persecution on the ground of religion and ethnicity as a Sikh and on political grounds because of his affiliation with the Bharatiya Janata Party ('the BJP'). 6 He applied to the RRT on 22 March 2004 for a review of the delegate's decision.
 He said that he and his family were supporters of the BJP and that in 1992 his father was elevated to an office within the BJP at the district level. 22 Due to his support for the BJP, the appellant said that he was considered to be an enemy of the Congress Party and he received threats from it.
 The only ground he considered to be of any substance was the possible failure to comply with s 424B(2). 28 Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones considered at some length the effect of the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 (" SAAP ").
 His Honour came to the view that the purpose and legislative context of s 424B was to be contrasted with that of s 424A , such that the legislative intention was not to be that a breach of the time provision in s 424B(2) would lead to the invalidation of a decision made following a breach of the section.
 There is an outer time limit within which the interview may take place but the RRT may appoint any date within the period, indeed, at the very hearing at which the invitation is extended; SZDQL at [50]. 40 By contrast, s 424B(2) is directed to the provision of information and comments by an applicant and when read with Reg 4.35(3), it sets an opening and closing period of 14 days after receipt of the invitation.
 It would be open to the invitee to provide the information or comments within that 14 day period but it is not open to the RRT to specify a date before the closing of that period by which the information or comments must be provided. 41 I do not consider that this difference in the operation of the two subsections leads to a different view of their objects.
 It seems to me that what Sackville J said in SZDQL as to the object of s 424B(3)(b) applies equally to s 424B(2). 42 However, it seems to me that there is a further aspect of the statutory purpose of those subsections which must be borne in mind when answering the question of whether a breach is jurisdictional in nature.
 Further support for this view is to be found in the observation of Sackville J in NAWR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1520 at [33] and [35], that no period other than the period of 14 days for the initial prescribed period or 28 days for the further prescribed period can be specified. 46 Against this, s 424B(2) and s 424B(3)(b) each provide that where no period is prescribed, the information or comments are to be given within a reasonable period.
