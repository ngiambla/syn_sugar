 In reliance upon that representation, Traxon entered into the agreement, purchased capital equipment for the production of the TraxOil Device for the purpose of selling it in the USA and, between May 1998 and November 2003, provided Emerson with confidential information about the device.
 It was agreed under the variation that Traxon and Emerson would jointly participate in a program of further development and refinement of the TraxOil Device and would jointly participate in the development of a new model of it. 10 In the alternative, it is alleged that the 2000 Sgreement was a substitute for the 1998 agreement and included the following express terms: 1.
 Traxon also claims damages represented by lower profits because of diminished sales of the TraxOil Device in the USA on or after 29 June 2005 and costs of $15,103 incurred by it in relation to its application for a new file to be maintained by Underwriters. 14 Traxon claims that Emerson breached the terms of the 1998 Agreement as varied by the 2000 Agreement and, alternatively, breached the terms of the original agreement and the terms of the substitute agreement.
 Again, the loss and damage claimed is the same amount. 16 A further alternative claim is that Traxon and Emerson engaged in a 'fiduciary joint venture' to develop and refine the TraxOil Device and, from February 2000, the TraxOil Generation 2.
 It recited the intention of Traxon and Alco Controls to discuss matters relating to refrigeration leak detection, oil level control, time delayed fluid level monitoring technology and other related inventions and in particular the manufacture of parts and or devices incorporating such technology.
 There is little or no reference to the sales of TraxOil Devices effected by Emerson under its distributorship arrangements during that period. 27 On 2 and 3 February 2000 Mr Cattach attended a meeting in St Louis, USA with representatives of Emerson and Alco Europe.
 Various emails were exhibited concerning day-to-day matters relating to the performance of the distribution agreements, sales of the TraxOil Device and its further development. 33 Traxon purchased plant and equipment for the purpose of manufacturing the TraxOil Device in 2002 and 2003.
 As from mid-January 2004 the TraxOil Device was not to be made jointly between the two companies and the letter requested that a new UL File be created for TraxOil Devices in Traxon's name alone. 39 Various emails were subsequently exchanged between Mr Cattach and representatives of Underwriters between 6 and 10 September 2004.
 Mr Waller recorded that with goodwill and cooperation Flow Controls and Traxon were in agreement to develop a partnering arrangement, with mutually beneficial projects, with the object of good business and the opportunity for Traxon to recover unnecessary incurred costs.
 Order 8 r 1(b) therefore applies to the cause of action in misleading or deceptive conduct. 58 The contract said to have been breached is 'the 1998 Agreement pleaded in paragraph 10 as varied by the 2000 Agreement' and alternatively 'the 1998 Agreement pleaded in paragraph 10 and the ... 2000 Agreement pleaded in paragraph 15'. 59 As pleaded the 1998 Agreement was made in Western Australia.
