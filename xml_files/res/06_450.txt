 They are also said to have agreed that the 1998 agreement would be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Western Australia. 8 Traxon alleges that by entering into the 1998 Agreement Emerson represented to it, in Western Australia, that Emerson would comply with its terms.
 He said that they agreed that their two companies would enter into a Distribution Agreement under which Traxon would supply the TraxOil Device exclusively to Emerson and Emerson would market and sell the TraxOil Device in the USA.
 There is little or no reference to the sales of TraxOil Devices effected by Emerson under its distributorship arrangements during that period. 27 On 2 and 3 February 2000 Mr Cattach attended a meeting in St Louis, USA with representatives of Emerson and Alco Europe.
