 This application had been lodged with the Department on behalf of the appellant by his agent, Kazi and Associates. 6 It is somewhat curious that the statutory declaration which formed part of the original protection visa application bears a different date from the copy of the statutory declaration which was included as part of the Appellant's application for review to the Tribunal as contained in the facsimile dated 12 August 2003 to which reference has been made.
 On 21 March 2006 an Amended Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court and it is that Notice of Appeal which has come before the Court for hearing. 13 When the matter was called on for hearing counsel for the Appellant, appearing pro bono, indicated that his client wished to rely upon an additional ground of appeal.
 After a short adjournment a document entitled 'Additional Ground for Review' was produced by counsel for the Appellant recording the precise terms of the ground upon which the Appellant wished to rely. 15 The hearing of the appeal has proceeded on the premise that the Court will both decide the application for the amendment and the appeal itself at the one time.
