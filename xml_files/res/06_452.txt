 The nature of the proceeding 1 This case is concerned with the validity of the nomination of Valerie Ann Butler for two offices in elections conducted within an organisation registered pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act').
 In order for her nominations to be valid, pursuant to the rules of the organisation, Ms Butler had to be a financial member attached to a particular divisional branch of the organisation, and had to have had that status for at least 12 months, at the date of closing of nominations.
 The question whether Ms Butler was a member attached to the relevant divisional branch is unusually complicated, because of difficulties of construction of the relevant rules, the failure of the rules to make provision for some matters, and failure to observe the rules in some respects. 2 The Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union ('the Union') is an organisation, registered pursuant to the WR Act.
