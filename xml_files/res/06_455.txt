 As to the first ground, his Honour found the Tribunal had not relied on media information but rather had relied on material provided by the appellant and was not satisfied on the basis of that material that the protection visa should be granted.
 This adoption had arisen through the appellant's statement asking the Tribunal to refer to the departmental file, under the section "Your reasons for making this application" in the application form seeking review by the Tribunal. 8 His Honour concluded on that basis that the Tribunal had not been obliged to give notice under s 424A of any adverse material derived from the original application, and s 424A had not been breached.
 The Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal was biased and not interested in making its decision. 10 The appellant's written submissions centred on the argument that the Tribunal had breached s 424A of the Act .
 The effect of the appellant's invitation to the Tribunal was, in substance, the same as if he had resubmitted to the Tribunal the material that had been advanced in support of his original application for the protection visa. 16 The appellant gave all information contained in the Departmental file to the Tribunal for the purpose of the application.
