 The RRT went on to say that if the appellant did not do so, the hearing would not take place and the RRT may make a decision on the evidence it already had. 6 On 11 September 1996, the RRT again wrote to the appellant attaching another hearing form to be completed and returned.
 Instead, it proceeded to decide the application and made its decision, adverse to the appellant, on 23 September 1996. 9 Evidence filed on behalf of the Minister in the application before the Federal Magistrate states that the appellant was notified of the decision of the RRT by letter dated 24 September 1996.
 Reference was made to Xie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1480 ; (1999) 95 FCR 543 in which Cooper J held that an applicant's failure to respond to an invitation does not entitle the RRT to assume that the person does not wish to attend.
 Whilst his Honour did not say so expressly, he seems to have proceeded on the assumption that the appellant was aware of the decision from the time when it was made in 1996. 37 His Honour also seems to have assumed that the appellant was aware of the decision from at least the time when an unsuccessful application was made to the Minister under s 417 of the Act .
