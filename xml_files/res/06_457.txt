 The RRT went on to say that if the appellant did not do so, the hearing would not take place and the RRT may make a decision on the evidence it already had. 6 On 11 September 1996, the RRT again wrote to the appellant attaching another hearing form to be completed and returned.
 The appellant was again informed that if he did not respond within the specified time the RRT would decide the case on the evidence available to it. 7 The appellant did not respond to either of the letters from the RRT and did not complete or return a hearing form. 8 The RRT did not await the appointed hearing date of 24 October 1996.
 Instead, it proceeded to decide the application and made its decision, adverse to the appellant, on 23 September 1996. 9 Evidence filed on behalf of the Minister in the application before the Federal Magistrate states that the appellant was notified of the decision of the RRT by letter dated 24 September 1996.
