 Ms Murfet, in the presence of the Board and substantially all the staff of Lipscombe Child Care, approximately 25 persons, read the contents of the letter of 18 October and "several times" repeated those allegations. 22 The publication of the letter of 18 October is alleged by par 29 to have been conduct in trade or commerce of Lipscombe Child Care in its business as a provider of child care services.
 In the view of the majority (Mason CJ, Dawson, Deane and Gaudron JJ) at 604-605, the foreman's statement was not made in the course of, or for the purposes of, some trading or commercial dealing between the corporation and the particular employee.
 The conduct of the foreman "consisted of an internal communication by one employee to another employee in the course of their ordinary activities in and about the construction of a building". 32 The application of the Concrete Constructions principle to conduct concerning contracts of employment has resulted in a divergence of Federal Court authority.
