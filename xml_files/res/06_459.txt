 However, as was pointed out by Sundberg J in Neowarra at [721], the relevant area for the purposes of s 47B is 'the particular area in relation to which it has been concluded that, but for the section, native title rights would be extinguished'.
 This area is a freehold block held by the Mamabulanjin Aboriginal Corporation. 92 An initial question arises as to whether land held by a body that is incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (Cth) ('the ACA Act' ) is land held 'expressly for the benefit' of Aboriginal peoples for the purposes of s 47A.
