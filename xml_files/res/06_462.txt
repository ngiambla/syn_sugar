 Application for reinstatement of registration was made by the company in order that the foregoing acts could be validated and to allow the company to continue to carry on business as a provider of consultancy services. 8 It seems that deregistration of the company was effected by ASIC pursuant to s 601AB(1A) of the Act .
 Under that section ASIC may decide to deregister a company if a "review fee" in respect of a "review date" has not been paid in full twelve months after the "due date". 9 Section 345A(1) of the Act provides that the "review date" for the company is the anniversary of its registration.
 It is necessary to have regard to earlier provisions of company law to understand the context in which that provision of s 601AH(2)(a)(i) is to be construed. 16 At one time the Companies Act 1948 (UK), the Australian Uniform Companies Act 1961-1962 and Companies Act 1955 (NZ) all contained similar provisions that permitted a company that had been struck off the register of companies that felt aggrieved by that fact to apply to the Court, within a specified period of years, for an order that the company be restored to the register.
 ASIC did not attend on the hearing of the application. 31 In all the circumstances it appears to be just to order that ASIC reinstate registration of the company and that a further order be made under s 601AH(3) of the Act that anything done between deregistration of the company and reinstatement be validated. 32 Orders will be made accordingly.
