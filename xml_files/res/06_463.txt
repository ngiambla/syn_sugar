 In either circumstance it would follow that SETL would be a creditor of London Partners in respect of an unliquidated sum. (See: Re: R L Child Co Pty Ltd (1986) 10 ACLR 673, per McLelland J at 674; FCT v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477 per Mansfield J at 481; Re McLean (1992) 108 ALR 360; Forshaw v Thompson (1992) 35 FCR 329; Petrochemical Industries Ltd v Dempster Nominees Pty Ltd (1994) 15 ACSR 468 per Murray J at 475-476). 15 The fact that at this point SETL does not pursue such a claim in the proceeding does not remove the claim from the scope of the proceeding.
 That may be an arguable point but it involves an issue of construction that is not clear-cut and is a question to be determined at trial if the point is raised in any defence filed. 18 It is, however, a point that may be taken into consideration with other matters to ascertain whether there is a preponderant balance against the grant of leave. 19 The second point of opposition is the contention that SETL has unduly delayed the commencement of this proceeding to the prejudice of other creditors of London Partners.
