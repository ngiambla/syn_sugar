 In that proceeding, SETL seeks a declaration that the issue of shares in SETL to London Partners was invalid and orders for the delivery up and cancellation of the relevant share certificate or certificates and rectification of the SETL share register by expunging London Partners therefrom. 2 Section 444E of the Act provides that until a deed of company arrangement is terminated a person bound by the deed cannot, except with the leave of the Court, begin or proceed with a proceeding against the company that is subject to the deed. 3 Section 444D(1) of the Act provides that a deed of company arrangement binds all creditors of the company so far as concerns claims arising before the date of commencement of the administration or a prior date fixed by the deed. 4 SETL operates a business which carries out research, development, manufacture and distribution of braking systems.
 The prospectus was issued to the public on 21 February 2002. 7 In the proceeding brought by SETL against London Partners it is alleged, in effect, that certain directors of SETL, acting in concert with London Partners, caused SETL to issue 10,000,000 SETL securities to London Partners on 18 February 2002 for the improper purposes of providing an undisclosed benefit to London Partners and to enable London Partners to use those securities to induce persons to subscribe to SETL securities pursuant to the prospectus. 8 SETL pleads that to the knowledge of London Partners the directors in so acting breached their fiduciary duties to SETL and contravened s 181(1)(b) of the Act by failing to exercise their powers for a proper purpose. 9 On 31 October 2003 London Partners entered a Deed of Company Arrangement pursuant to Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) the arrangement being varied by further deeds executed on 31 October, 2003, 20 April 2004 and 8 November 2004. 10 London Partners remains the registered owner of the SETL securities issued to it on 18 February 2002. 11 The primary submission made by SETL is that it is not a creditor of London Partners and, therefore, leave of the Court is not required for SETL to proceed with a proceeding that seeks declaratory orders binding London Partners in respect of the securities issued to it. 12 The Deed of Company Arrangement defines a creditor who is bound by the Deed in the following terms: ' Creditor means any person or company who at the Appointment Date had a pecuniary claim against either or both of the Companies, whether present or future, certain or contingent or ascertained or sounding only in damages, including (but not limited to) any person who would have been entitled to prove in the winding up of either or both of the Companies had an order been made for the winding up of the company concerned by the Court upon an application filed on the Appointment Date and who is admitted by the Administrators as having a provable debt. ' 13 To the extent that the statement of claim in this proceeding does not identify a money claim made by SETL against London Partners it is argued that SETL is not a creditor of London Partners and, therefore, not a person bound by the Deed of Company Arrangement. 14 However, the width of the meaning of the term creditor in the Deed is likely to bring SETL within the class of creditors to which s 444D(1) and 444E apply. (See: Smith v Carr (1993) 10 ACSR 427 per Debelle J at 432).
 In either circumstance it would follow that SETL would be a creditor of London Partners in respect of an unliquidated sum. (See: Re: R L Child Co Pty Ltd (1986) 10 ACLR 673, per McLelland J at 674; FCT v Simionato Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 477 per Mansfield J at 481; Re McLean (1992) 108 ALR 360; Forshaw v Thompson (1992) 35 FCR 329; Petrochemical Industries Ltd v Dempster Nominees Pty Ltd (1994) 15 ACSR 468 per Murray J at 475-476). 15 The fact that at this point SETL does not pursue such a claim in the proceeding does not remove the claim from the scope of the proceeding.
 That may be an arguable point but it involves an issue of construction that is not clear-cut and is a question to be determined at trial if the point is raised in any defence filed. 18 It is, however, a point that may be taken into consideration with other matters to ascertain whether there is a preponderant balance against the grant of leave. 19 The second point of opposition is the contention that SETL has unduly delayed the commencement of this proceeding to the prejudice of other creditors of London Partners.
