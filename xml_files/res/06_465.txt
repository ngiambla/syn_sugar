 Section 20, also within Div 2, provides that if a law of either a State or Territory validates a past act, the native title holders are entitled to compensation if they would be so entitled under s 17 'on the assumption that section 17 applies to acts attributable to the State or Territory'.
 Section 48 therefore appears to equate an entitlement to compensation created by Divs 2 and 2B with 'compensation payable'. 12 Section 49(a) states that compensation is only payable under the NT Act once for acts that are essentially the same.
 Section 50(2) provides that: '[a]n application may be made to the Federal Court under Part 3 for a determination of the compensation'. 14 At the time the current proceedings were commenced, s 61(1) of the NT Act , which is within Part 3, provided that a compensation application, being an application under s 50(2) for a determination of compensation, could be made by a person or persons claiming to be entitled to compensation.
