 I would, therefore, discharge the order which I made on 27 March 2006 suppressing the publication of the names of the two complainants. 42 I turn now to the application by counsel for the newspapers that the newspapers be permitted to inspect the affidavit of the applicant dated 17 March 2006 and all of its exhibits.
 Senior counsel for the University opposed the application by the newspapers on the grounds that the complainants' affidavits were made in circumstances of confidentiality. 44 The position in relation to the inspection by non parties of affidavits filed at the Court is governed by O 46 r 6(3)(a) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules').
