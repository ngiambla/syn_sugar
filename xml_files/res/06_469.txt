 It contended that the emails and attachments are "communications" prepared for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or form part of its lawyer's investigations for the purpose of this proceeding. 9 Counsel for Forestry Tasmania submitted that the Evidence Act does not apply to its objections to produce the documents called for by Senator Brown.
 Order 33 rule 11(5) of the Rules of Court extends the operation of ss 118 and 119 of the Evidence Act to orders for the production of documents in circumstances where the call for production is made in the course of evidence being adduced before the Court; see Collins Debden Pty Ltd v Cumberland Stationery Co Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1194 at [6] , per Lindgren J.
 Does s 119 apply? 15 Section 119 , when read with O 33 r 11(5) of the Rules of Court, prevents the production of documents if, on the objection of a client, the Court finds the production would result in the disclosure of a confidential communication between the client and another person, or between a lawyer acting for the client and another person, for the dominant purpose of providing the client with legal services relating to a proceeding. 16 Section 117(1) contains a definition of "confidential communication".
 Order 33 rule 11 applies at the stage where evidence is being adduced in conjunction with ss 118 and 119 by extending their operation. 21 Whether O 33 r 11, in conjunction with ss 118 and 119 , is a code is beside the point.
