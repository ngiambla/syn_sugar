 The appellant, being by that stage self-represented, and obviously unaware of the technical requirements associated with his application, filed a notice of appeal pursuant to O 52 r 12 of the Federal Court Rules , rather than an application for leave to appeal.
 He claimed that supporters of the People's Alliance had planned to kill supporters of Mr Mendis, and he referred to the murder of a particular UNP member on 23 September 1996.
 He therefore determined that the appellant did not have an arguable case, and dismissed the application to set aside the default judgment. 13 In a notice of appeal dated 3 January 2006, the appellant relies upon two grounds of appeal.
 He referred to documents and affidavits from members of his family in Sri Lanka, and his past employees, who had been threatened to provide information as to his whereabouts after he left that country.
