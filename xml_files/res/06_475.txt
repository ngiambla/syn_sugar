 1 This is an application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal against a judgement of a Federal Magistrate of 2 December 2005: SZFFL v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2005] FMCA 1978.
 The applicant had explained that he was sick, but had apparently not attempted to notify the Court, and had provided no documentary evidence to support his explanation. 6 Nicholls FM also considered each ground raised by the applicant in his amended application, finding that none had been made out.
 For present purposes, it does not matter whether the application should be to extend time to apply for leave to appeal. 7 The application for an extension of time to appeal was filed in this Court on 9 February 2006.
 The draft notice of appeal, filed together with the application, merely stated: "I said the problems in Federal Magistrates Court of Australia but they did not consider and reject my application so I kindly request you to consider in the Federal Court of Australia. " An affidavit filed by the applicant on the same day apparently sought to explain the applicant's delay in filing a notice of appeal by stating that the applicant did not receive the Federal Magistrate's decision until 25 January 2006. 8 On the day of the hearing in this Court, there was no appearance for the applicant.
