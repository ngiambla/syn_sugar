 The application was an abuse of process, pursuant to Rule 13.10(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth). 2 Before the Federal Magistrate, the applicant sought to re-agitate issues substantially the same as those which had previously been litigated in both this Court and the High Court.
 This application for leave is doomed to fail. 4 The only remaining matter is that the day prior to the hearing, a facsimile letter from was received by the registry of this Court from the first applicant.
 It is insufficient evidence, in my opinion, to sustain a finding that it was reasonable for the applicant not to attend the hearing, and certainly would not have precluded the applicant having someone attend on his behalf.
