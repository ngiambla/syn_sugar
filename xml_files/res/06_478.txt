 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 6 February 2006 in which an application for judicial review was summarily dismissed: see SZHGO ORS V Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Anor [2006] FMCA 185.
 The application was an abuse of process, pursuant to Rule 13.10(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth). 2 Before the Federal Magistrate, the applicant sought to re-agitate issues substantially the same as those which had previously been litigated in both this Court and the High Court.
 Details of the length history of litigation were recounted in her Honour's reasons at [2] to [9] and need not be repeated here. 3 There was no error attending the decision of the Magistrate to dismiss the application.
 This application for leave is doomed to fail. 4 The only remaining matter is that the day prior to the hearing, a facsimile letter from was received by the registry of this Court from the first applicant.
 It is insufficient evidence, in my opinion, to sustain a finding that it was reasonable for the applicant not to attend the hearing, and certainly would not have precluded the applicant having someone attend on his behalf.
 The applicant repeated that he was too ill to attend and secondly, would not be able to attend even if the matter was stood down for hearing later in the day. 6 The application for an adjournment is refused and the application is dismissed.
