 Another member of that Tribunal determined, on 27 April 2005, that the respondent should pay the applicant's costs up to and including the time of receipt by the applicant's solicitors of a letter of offer of settlement from the respondent on 21 August 2002. 2 The letter in question was forwarded by the respondent about seven months prior to the hearing.
 The offer was clear in its terms and the applicant had elected to a hearing despite the offer. 4 The Tribunal's decision was the subject of an appeal heard by Greenwood J [2006] FCA 33.
 The applicant's solicitor says that he does not consider that the respondent is prejudiced by such a delay. 7 Order 52 rule 15 fixes the time within which a notice of appeal must be filed and served.
 It had concerned me that the applicant was exposed to additional costs because the Court set the matter down for hearing without appreciating he was attempting to have the matter dealt with on the papers.
