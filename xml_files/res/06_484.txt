 THE APPEAL 18 The appellant has appealed on substantially two grounds, namely: (a) the learned Federal Magistrate erred when he found that the Tribunal had correctly interpreted reg 1.03, and (b) the learned Federal Magistrate erred when he found that the Tribunal had correctly interpreted the medical evidence. 19 It is appropriate to examine these grounds.
 None of the evidence presented suggests that this assistance provided by the visa applicant is 'substantial'...' (par 62) 30 The finding of the Tribunal in par 62 in my view underlines the correct approach in analysing the condition of the nominator and whether the application of the visa application satisfies the requirements of the Act.
 In my view it is not necessary for the Tribunal in reaching that conclusion to specifically make a finding of fact in relation to whether the nominator had suffered from 'prolonged illness' when the decision specifically states that the ailments and illnesses of the nominator were not in the Tribunal's view of a serious nature or did not constitute the serious circumstance envisaged by the regulations.
