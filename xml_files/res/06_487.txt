 Consequently, subject to one matter, I see no principled basis for reducing the general costs order below 100%. 5 The qualification I have in mind is that Order 62 rule 36A(1) applies to the recovery against the third respondent.
 I do not know the amount of these costs but they are probably substantial. 7 In my earlier reasons for judgment, I stated why I declined to accept Mr Robertson's estimate of damages.
