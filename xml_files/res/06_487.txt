 Consequently, subject to one matter, I see no principled basis for reducing the general costs order below 100%. 5 The qualification I have in mind is that Order 62 rule 36A(1) applies to the recovery against the third respondent.
 Counsel for the respondents argue that any general costs order should exclude all costs associated with the report or evidence of Stuart Robertson of Ernst and Young, Chartered Accountants.
 I do not know the amount of these costs but they are probably substantial. 7 In my earlier reasons for judgment, I stated why I declined to accept Mr Robertson's estimate of damages.
 My decision to do so was not an implied criticism of Mr Robertson but, rather, arose out of the fact that the matters he assumed were unsupported by evidence.
