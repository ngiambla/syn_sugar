 His Honour said that the Court's power to do so was to be seen as part of a wider power under the section to make a costs order against non-parties generally, and referred to Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd [1986] 1 AC 965 (' Aiden ') and Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 ( 'Knight' ).
 In those cases, orders were made against non-parties other than legal practitioners under the general provisions conferring power to order costs (in Aiden , s 51(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK); and in Knight , s 58 of the Supreme Court Act 1867 (Qld) and O 91 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland).
 A rule such as O 62 r 9(1) does not reduce the power to order costs conferred otherwise. 19 In In Re Land and Property Trust Co Plc [1991] 1 WLR 601, a costs order was made, not against legal practitioners, but against a company's directors.
