 The Registry wrote to Macteldir's solicitors, Petrovski Lawyers, the solicitors for Macteldir (providing copies of the letter to the solicitors for the Barrister and the Solicitor) advising that the notice of appeal had been wrongly accepted for filing by the Registry and had been 'voided', apparently on the view that Allsop J's decision was interlocutory.
 Despite the existence of this provision, apparently it did not occur to anyone that leave might be required because the order that the solicitor pay costs was an interlocutory order. 16 In concluding that the costs order against the solicitor was not an order 'relating only to costs', the Court of Appeal described it as an order relating to the conduct of the solicitor. 17 The Barrister and the Solicitor submit that such cases are to be explained as turning upon the inherent disciplinary jurisdiction exercised by courts or general jurisdiction over their officers.
 In those cases, orders were made against non-parties other than legal practitioners under the general provisions conferring power to order costs (in Aiden , s 51(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK); and in Knight , s 58 of the Supreme Court Act 1867 (Qld) and O 91 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland).
 A rule such as O 62 r 9(1) does not reduce the power to order costs conferred otherwise. 19 In In Re Land and Property Trust Co Plc [1991] 1 WLR 601, a costs order was made, not against legal practitioners, but against a company's directors.
