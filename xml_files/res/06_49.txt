 However, the Tribunal went on to indicate that even if the appellant in these proceedings had, on a limited basis, identified corruption in her published articles, that fact was not likely to give rise to persecution against her. 4 In the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate three grounds were argued.
 The notice of appeal filed in these proceedings identified one ground, namely that the Magistrate erred in law in holding that the Tribunal did not err in failing to consider whether she had a well-founded fear of persecution for the reason of her political opinion.
 It is not entirely clear whether that ground is intended to involve a repetition of the grounds advanced before the Magistrate or some additional ground. 5 I have read the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate.
 It is not apparent that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error, nor is it apparent that the Federal Magistrate erred in concluding that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error. 6 The appellant's failure before the Tribunal arose primarily because of the non-acceptance by the Tribunal of her account of her experiences in Mongolia.
