 The issue which arose was whether the Tribunal was bound to give fourteen days' notice, in accordance with those provisions, where the hearing was rescheduled at the appellant's request. 13 Nicholls FM referred to the decision of Conti J in SZDQO v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1026 ; (2005) 144 FCR 251 (" SZDQO") which addressed this issue.
 As His Honour correctly observed, this must be subject to the provisions of s 422B which provides that Division 4 of Part 7 is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with. 28 Section 422B applies to applications to the Tribunal for review of a decision filed after 4 July 2002; see SZATG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 83 ALD 596 at [31]; see also SZBDF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1493 (" SZBDF") at [11].
 His home address was recorded on the response to hearing invitation (for the original hearing date) which he signed and forwarded to the Tribunal. 36 Moreover, the Tribunal's record sheet states that on 1 October 2003, the day before the scheduled hearing, a Tribunal officer rang the appellant's agent twice only to be informed that the agent could not contact the appellant because his mobile phone was switched off.
