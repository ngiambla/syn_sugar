 The appellant submitted that Phipps FM erred when he concluded that the Tribunal's finding was merely a finding based on what had occurred in the past and a finding that the appellant would continue to act in the same way in the future if he returned to Burma. 21 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal made jurisdictional errors of the kind described in Appellant S395/2002 .
 This finding is difficult to reconcile with the Tribunal's conclusion that the appellant 'knows and understands the political situation [in Burma]' and if he returns, 'will not act in such a way as to bring himself to the adverse attention of those authorities'.
 The Tribunal seems to have found that the appellant should be characterised as a 'low-profile' rather than 'high-profile' anti-government protestor, notwithstanding his political activities in Australia and the fact that his activities in Burma had previously brought him to the adverse attention of the authorities.
