 The appellant did not attend on that day but agreed to attend a hearing on 23 June 2003. 12 At the Tribunal hearing, the appellant lodged nine laminated documents which appeared to the Tribunal member to be upgraded RMIT Transcripts of Results.
 The Tribunal stated that RMIT did not provide the Tribunal with exact figures for the appellant's attendance throughout the relevant period, however the Tribunal noted that it was clear that the appellant's attendance was poor. 15 The Tribunal took into account that strict compliance with cls 572.212 and 572.226 is not required and that substantial compliance is sufficient to meet the criteria: Baidakova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436 (' Baidakova' ).
 In my opinion, this is a misreading of Gurung : Tamberlin J in that case held that it was open to the Tribunal to find that the applicant had not substantially complied with condition 8202, having regard to the applicant's high failure rate.
 There was ample evidence of the appellant's poor academic performance in the present case, and of RMIT's opinion that the appellant's results were unsatisfactory. 29 In my view, it was clearly open to the Tribunal to find that the appellant failed to substantially comply with condition 8202 during the relevant period.
