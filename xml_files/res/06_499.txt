 I am satisfied that the current proceedings are an abuse of process and ought to be summarily dismissed to avoid further public expense in defending proceedings that have already taken up the resources of the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the High Court and have raised no arguable case. ' 4 It has been long established that an application for leave to appeal should fail if no arguable ground of appeal is raised by the applicant, or if the judgment below is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant allowing the application or the appeal to go forward. 5 The applicants have failed to identify any conceivably viable arguable ground of appeal.
 At least in the absence of any evidence to support those allegations or any particulars in order to render the same meaningful, which is the situation here readily evident, the present purported application must necessarily fail. 6 The applicants have not identified or pleaded any conceivably viable error in relation to the Federal Magistrate's finding that the applicants' proceedings constituted an abuse of process.
