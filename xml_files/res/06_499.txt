 I am satisfied that the current proceedings are an abuse of process and ought to be summarily dismissed to avoid further public expense in defending proceedings that have already taken up the resources of the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the High Court and have raised no arguable case. ' 4 It has been long established that an application for leave to appeal should fail if no arguable ground of appeal is raised by the applicant, or if the judgment below is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant allowing the application or the appeal to go forward. 5 The applicants have failed to identify any conceivably viable arguable ground of appeal.
 At least in the absence of any evidence to support those allegations or any particulars in order to render the same meaningful, which is the situation here readily evident, the present purported application must necessarily fail. 6 The applicants have not identified or pleaded any conceivably viable error in relation to the Federal Magistrate's finding that the applicants' proceedings constituted an abuse of process.
 What amounts to four pages of written submissions, having the hallmarks of authorship of a migration agent, merely revisits in substance a purported merits review of the original RRT decision made in October 2003. 7 The reasons for judgment of Barnes FM are not attended by sufficient doubt and rightly emphasised in particular the importance of the Courts exercising original jurisdiction in migration proceedings not to permit repeated adjudication of challenges to the original Tribunal decision. 8 There has been no demonstration of error in the approach of Barnes FM below, and the present application constitutes an abuse of process, by way of recommencing and pursuing the same case in substance that has already failed at each stage of prosecution.
