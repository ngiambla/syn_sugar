 They say that notwithstanding an admission on the pleadings that Oltramare was the registered owner, the Memorandum for Agreement for Sale dated 12 March 2003 identifies the owners as being Oltramare for a one percent interest and the second defendant (Louis Dreyfus Armateurs SAS) for ninety-nine percent.
 I do not, however, accept the submission by the defendants that it has not been demonstrated that all documents or records sought are, or are likely to be, relevant to the issues raised by the plaintiffs' claim or the establishment of the alleged beneficial ownership of the vessel.
 In addition, the defendants refer to the fact that all documents and other records concerning hire are sought, and that this would cover a large number of incidental records in relation to payment of hire, bank records, receipts and documents concerning disputes which may have arisen between the defendants themselves and also with third parties.
 PARAGRAPH 6 13 This refers to all books of account, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, freight records, crew wage records, expense records, hire documents, freight documents or other financial records of the defendants concerning the ship "La Pampa" for the period 27 March 2001 to 1 May 2003.
 I accept the observation that the reference to "all crew wage records" could include crew lists, documents reporting payment of wages to crew, leave payments, payments of expenses and other documents recording repatriation, and changeover of the crew with associated expenses and many more documents which on their face do not appear to be relevant and should be narrowed.
 PARAGRAPH 9 14 This seeks all documents concerning payments received in relation to the sale of the ship "La Pampa" including documents of records evidencing payment pursuant to the contract, records of payment or other records concerning the distribution of the proceeds of sale.
 As noted in the submission for the defendants, no objection could be taken to a request for production of documents recording or evidencing the payment or receipt of the proceeds of the vessel, including any distribution of proceeds.
