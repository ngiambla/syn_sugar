 Its principal arguments in support of the rejection of the entirety of the report are that: (i) the report does not disclose a reasoning process sufficient to enable the Court to determine whether the opinions expressed reflect Mr Salter's specialised knowledge based on his training, study or experience, as required by ss 76(1) and 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (' Evidence Act '); and (ii) the report does not explain why (as Mr Salter claims): '[t]he deal premium paid by strategic acquirers in excess of the deal premium paid by financial acquirers is a reasonable proxy for the valuation of synergies and opportunities available to the combined company post-transaction'.
 In my opinion, if Seven positioned itself as an IMC in a manner that leveraged its content, core operating efficiencies and brand in a complementary manner across a number of different media and distribution channels, the Seven Network would benefit from increased revenue opportunities, including offering integrated advertising packages, without substantially increasing its costs'. 12 Mr Salter says that he has developed an approach to assess the value of the market premium attributable to synergies and growth opportunities available to IMC.
 FURTHER OBSERVATIONS 29 Because Mr Sheahan SC foreshadowed the possibility that Seven would seek to adduce further evidence from Mr Salter to cure the evidentiary defects in his report, I think it is appropriate to make some additional comments. 30 As I have pointed out, Mr Salter expresses the opinion that Seven, if it adopted its proposed IMC strategy, would have benefited from increased revenue opportunities, integrated advertising packages and other benefits, without experiencing an increase in its costs.
 There is, however, no reasoning process that explains why Mr Salter considers that Seven Network's assessment would have proved to be correct in the particular circumstances of the Australian television industry in 2001. 32 Nothing has been put to me in argument to suggest that there is evidence, other than the opinions expressed by Mr Salter, that would justify finding that Seven's proposed IMC strategy (assuming that such a strategy was in fact in place) would have been likely to succeed or, more particularly, that the strategy would have produced benefits comparable to those apparently available to the firms involved in the mergers of media companies identified by Mr Salter.
