 The three respondents are companies which are incorporated respectively in Australia, PNG and the United Kingdom. 2 The proceedings arise out of a contract for the provision of catering services at the Ok Tedi mine in PNG.
 They say that they engaged the respondents to prepare a tender proposal under which the respondents would manage the contract for the applicants and that subsequently a management agreement was entered into. 3 The applicants have raised a variety of allegations and causes of action against the respondents.
 The respondents say they are not willing to 'relocate their entire trial operation' because the applicants want to call witnesses all of whom resided in PNG at the time that the proceedings were instituted.
 The counsel and instructing solicitors for the parties are all in Perth. 6 There was some affidavit evidence from the solicitors for the parties about the costs of conducting the trial in Perth and Brisbane respectively.
