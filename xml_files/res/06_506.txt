 His Honour found that once the RRT was satisfied that there was no objective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, it was not required to further consider the subjective fear of the appellant (following the approach in SCAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 964 (" SCAM ") and WAHK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 22 (" WAHK ")).
 Counsel also contended that the RRT had failed to have regard to this country information or any other such information relating to the situation in Kenya after the fall from power of Daniel Arap Moi. 10 The appellant acknowledged that these claims had not been expressly raised before the RRT.
 Thus, in the appellant's view, it committed jurisdictional error by failing to consider that possibility. 11 The first respondent submitted that the RRT was not required to consider subjective factors once it had found that the appellant did not have an objective basis to fear persecution.
 The respondent accepted that, in some circumstances, the RRT might be required to consider a claim that had not been expressly raised before it, but the respondent submitted that the RRT had not been obliged to do so in the present case.
