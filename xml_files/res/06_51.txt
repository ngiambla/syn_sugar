 AWB contended, however, that AWB's fax of 3 August 1999 was not an offer capable of acceptance. 47 AWB argued that the text of the fax and the surrounding circumstances would not have led a reasonable reader to conclude that AWB was agreeing to pay Soufflet USA's damages claim.
 Thus, in AWB's submission, a reasonable reader would have expected some discussion of the damages claim in any communication purporting to accept it. 49 AWB also suggested that, as of 3 August 1999, Soufflet USA's damages claim faced at least two significant hurdles.
 In the applicant's submission, the contract was a paradigmatic example of accord and satisfaction. 61 The problem with this view is that AWB was not asking Soufflet USA to make a concession when it submitted a different load port calculation.
