 AWB also relied on clause 16 in support of the contention that damages for the losses occasioned by the delay were not recoverable under the Charter Party. 50 Furthermore, AWB relied on the language of its 3 August 1999 fax.
 It contended that the statement "we have checked the figures in Soufflet USA Claim and would only disagree with the Load Port Despatch calculation" does no more than present information concerning calculations and should not be construed as an offer.
 Similarly, AWB argued that the sentence stating "Please see attached, our own Laytime computation, which please go through and confirm your concurrance [sic] for us to proceed with the balance settlements of this Vessel-account" indicates that the author expected further discussion and negotiations concerning the account. 51 AWB claimed that, in its fax of 1 April 1999, it placed Soufflet USA on notice that it intended to deal with the damages claim as a separate issue from others arising under the Charter Party.
