 1 This is an appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate of 13 January 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"): SZBZK v Minister for Immigration and Anor (No 2) [2006] FMCA 33.
 Thirdly, the appellant claimed that the Federal Magistrate had erred in not identifying error in the Tribunal's decision, having regard to the way the Tribunal dealt with the independent country information provided by the appellant.
 As to the quantification of those costs, I have been informed by the solicitor for the first respondent, and I accept, that at the relevant time, an order in the amount awarded was within the range of costs then being fixed by the Federal Magistrates Court for such matters.
 Indeed, it appears to that the appellant had sought legal representation before the hearing from a variety of sources including Legal Aid and some form of pro bono assistance, but had been unsuccessful. 6 Finally, there is the matter of the Tribunal's evaluation of the independent country information.
