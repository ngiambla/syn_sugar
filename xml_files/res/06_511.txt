 As against the Second and Third Respondents as holding companies: 2.1 Declarations that each of them have contravened Section 588V of the Corporations Law and/or Corporations Act ; 2.2 Orders pursuant to Section 588W of the Corporations Law and/or Corporations Act requiring each of them to compensate the First Applicant for loss and damage incurred as a consequence of such contraventions; 3.
 As against the Second and Third Respondents as employers/principals: 3.1 Declarations that they are vicariously liable for the conduct of Ho and Binney; 3.2 Orders that they are liable to Akai Australia in respect of the liability of Binney and Ho to Akai Australia. 4.
 It is said that there is no occasion to, nor basis for, attributing any different or wider authority. 14 Counsel for Akai submits that there is a body of evidence which points to the inference that Messrs Binney, Yuen and Lam were each, in fact, acting upon instructions given to them by Ho on behalf of Grande Holdings.
 It seems to me, however, that a possible view of the facts at a prima facie level is that the directors and officers of Akai Australia were prepared to, and did, accept instruction from those whom they regarded as speaking for the Grande group of companies as a whole and, in particular, from those speaking with the authority of the ultimate holding company, Grande Holdings, and its effective controller, Ho.
