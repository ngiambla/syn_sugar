 In his view, however, the impact of the loss of the AFL rights and the failure to attain the NRL rights on the IMS was 'profound': 'Without access to such content (the AFL and the NRL) that could overcome consumer inertia and act as a catalyst to the consumer purchase decision, deriving value from producing and providing wholesale sporting or non-sporting channels would be, if possible, problematic and the return, if any, modest.
 For this purpose, he: ' (a) [describes] the structure of the television industry, the differing commercial imperatives of free-to-air and pay television, the pay television business model and the impact of technology on the industry; (b) [considers] the role played by content in the purchase decision (including "premium" content, being movie and sports programming) and the impact of relevant regulation (for example, anti-siphoning regulation) and other constraints (for example, restrictions imposed by sporting bodies); and (c) [identifies] those attributes that, in addition to wide and robust appeal, determine what, if any, content could be considered "must have" content, essential for a retail pay television operator to reach critical mass' (par 5.1). 12 Section 5 , which is 45 pages long, contains only a few references to the Australian television industry.
 Mr Kinsella uses this material to support his opinion that (par 6.9): ' The price comparison clearly indicates that four team sports (the AFL, NRL, cricket and Rugby Union) are potentially "marquee" sports with the AFL replacing the NRL as the top earner from television following the conclusion of a new contract for the period 2002 to 2006. ' 16 Mr Kinsella also relies on statistical information obtained from a variety of published sources.
 Indeed Seven's written submissions appear to concede that Mr Kinsella has little knowledge of the Australian pay television industry. 24 The assumption underlying his analysis seems to be that the thirteen criteria can be applied to the Australian pay television industry by a person with experience in or knowledge of pay television in another country.
 Rather ... he has identified from his extensive knowledge of the pay TV industry factors relevant to the identification of subscription drivers and, in particular, "must have" or "marquee" sport for the purposes of pay TV and then applied those factors in section 6 to specific data and assumptions he has been given about Australian sports and has general knowledge of the value of sports rights derived from his training, study and experience'.
 Mr Kinsella's report does not, however, attempt to justify or explain the assumption that any specified knowledge he has can be usefully transferred for the purpose of expressing opinions about the role of sports rights in the Australian pay television industry. 25 The apparent absence of substantial experience in or knowledge of Australian pay television is not a trivial matter.
 That distinction in turn underpins Mr Kinsella's assessment of the impact of Seven's loss of the AFL rights for the 2002---2006 seasons and its failure to acquire the NRL rights for the 2001 to 2006 seasons. 26 The difficulty with the assumption underlying Mr Kinsella's analysis can be illustrated by reference to the anti-siphoning regime in force in Australia.
 It has been foreshadowed that I will receive a good deal more evidence about the acquisition by Seven and Network Ten Pty Ltd of the AFL television rights for 2007-2011 (including the pay television rights). 28 There is nothing to indicate that Mr Kinsella is versed in the detail and nuances of the practical operation of the anti-siphoning regime in Australia.
 To put the matter another way, it is difficult to see what assistance Mr Kinsella's views can be in relation to sports broadcasting rights and their importance to the Australian pay television industry, when he appears not to have the expertise required to make a fully informed judgment. 29 That does not necessarily mean that Mr Kinsella's views are wrong.
