 Mr Kinsella's report does not, however, attempt to justify or explain the assumption that any specified knowledge he has can be usefully transferred for the purpose of expressing opinions about the role of sports rights in the Australian pay television industry. 25 The apparent absence of substantial experience in or knowledge of Australian pay television is not a trivial matter.
 He distinguishes, for example, between the effect of the anti-siphoning regime on broadcasting rights for international cricket and those for the AFL and the NRL. 27 I have, however, heard a great deal of evidence in this case about the way the Australian anti-siphoning regime has operated in practice in relation to sports broadcasting rights.
 It has been foreshadowed that I will receive a good deal more evidence about the acquisition by Seven and Network Ten Pty Ltd of the AFL television rights for 2007-2011 (including the pay television rights). 28 There is nothing to indicate that Mr Kinsella is versed in the detail and nuances of the practical operation of the anti-siphoning regime in Australia.
