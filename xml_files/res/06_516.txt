 As the joinder of Ms Nader is based upon affidavit evidence served in support of the existing pleadings, the case against Ms Nader is a matter currently in dispute in the proceedings. ' 27 Unfortunately, these principles do not address the considerations relevant for the exercise of the discretion to join Ms Nader in the factual context of this application.

 Wood v Cross Television Centre Pty Ltd [1962] NSWR 528 at 532 per Walsh J). 45 In Payne v Young [1979] HCA 39 ; (1980) 145 CLR 609 the High Court considered its analogical rule which, as Barwick CJ emphasized (145 CLR at 614) spoke of ' ... plaintiffs in whom any right to relief is alleged to exist'.
