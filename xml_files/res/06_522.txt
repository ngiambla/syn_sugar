 The Tribunal committed a reviewable error: (a) in not considering the Applicant's case on its merit, has failed to consider that Alexander College has made a mistake of enrolling the Applicant in those units which he had passed previously in International Business College. (b) in not considering the Applicant's case on its merit, has failed to consider that the Applicant was doing a "continuing course" in Alexander College rather than taking a new course or a new term for the period between 7 October 2003 and 28 November 2003.
 Further or in the alternative, the Tribunal committed reviewable error in not setting aside the Respondent's decision of cancellation of the Applicant's visa where the Respondent's decision was based on grounds other than those in respect of which, the Applicant was given notice under Section 119 of the Act. 3.
 The Federal Magistrate went on to find that the s 20 Notice was an invalid notice and that the invalid notice had a vitiating effect on the resultant decision made under s 116 of the Act to cancel the visa. 43 The appeal in Zhou is still pending.
