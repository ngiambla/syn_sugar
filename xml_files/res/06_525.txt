 In accordance with principles established by the decision of the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162, I order that the Refugee Review Tribunal be joined as a respondent to these proceedings. 3 The appellant is an Indian citizen from the state of Tamil Nadu, who arrived in Australia on 2 January 2002.
 The Tribunal found that the appellant was not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. 10 Further, the Tribunal did not accept the appellant's evidence that he would be arrested by the police in connection with Mr Ramesh's murder if he returned to India.
 The appellant has also submitted that the learned Federal Magistrate erred in confirming the findings of the Tribunal. 23 It appears however that the Tribunal has had available to it relevant information upon which to make a decision, including country information.
