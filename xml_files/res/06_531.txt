 The language of O 6 makes it clear that it is the grant of leave by the Court that is missing and that grant of leave is not a condition precedent to the issuing of the amended application or FASC.
 As in Cerche , the grant of leave validates the joinder of Mr Johnston as a respondent, from 2 December 2005. 20 Ms Richards, who appears for Mr Johnston, contends that O 6 r 2(b) does not contemplate that an applicant may file an amended document and thereby commence proceedings against a further respondent.
 Ms Richards raises a number of other ways in which the FASC fails to comply with the Rules, specifically O 13 r 8(1) and failure to mark up the amendments and submits that, while the amended documents have been filed, they were not properly filed as they failed strictly to comply with the requirements of the Rules.
