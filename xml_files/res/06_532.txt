 As a result, the Tribunal considered that when studying at Birzeit, Mr Brown would be undertaking full-time study and would therefore satisfy the activity test. 16 The Secretary submits that the Tribunal erred in its construction of s 541B(1) by failing to have regard to the narrow and broad context of the provision.
 That must be the same course as in subsection (a)(i) and is a reference back to ' a course of education at an educational institution ', the Sydney course. 19 During the period at Birzeit, Mr Brown was enrolled in an approved course of education (Arts/Law) at an educational institution (Sydney).
 I agree with that submission. 23 Mr Smith submits that the ' modern approach to construction of statues ' requires that regard be had to the purpose of the statute or section, which is ascertained by having regard not only to the grammatical meaning of the words but also to the broad context.
