 The Tribunal's failure to explain how the appellant's case differed from V v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs indicates that the Tribunal misunderstood the law or that its finding on this point was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds.
 The Tribunal considered the motivation of the persecutors and, as a finding of fact ( Ramirez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 176 ALR 514 at [38]), determined that it was not for reasons of actual or imputed political opinion but because of his capacity to testify against them.
 While his submissions are not entirely clear, he accepts that the Tribunal recognised that an attitude of resistance to systemic corruption in government can amount to an expression of political opinion ( V v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ).
