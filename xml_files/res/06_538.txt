 I do accept however that after he was discharged from the Army his alcohol consumption increased and he admitted that he put on a good deal of weight after he left the Army and before 1978.
 I do not believe that this man has had a problem with alcohol and I am not satisfied that at any stage he suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse or that he warranted a psychiatric diagnosis of alcohol abuse.
 In respect of the third step from Deledio , in relation to factor 5(b) of the SoP, the Tribunal takes into account the estimates given by the applicant, in Exhibit 6, of his alcohol consumption in 1978.
 The Tribunal accepts the evidence that, although the applicant increased his alcohol consumption after service, his weight on enlistment and discharge was almost the same, despite his evidence of developing a liking for salty snack foods in Vietnam.
