 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of 2 November 2005, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") of 21 June 2005. 2 The appeal proceeds by way of a document entitled "Amended Notice of Appeal" filed in this Court on 13 December 2005.
 No written submissions have been filed by the appellant, notwithstanding a direction that he do so. 4 When asked to explain orally what the errors of the Tribunal were, the appellant raised the matter of his purported marriage and, more generally, his concerns about being persecuted by a fundamentalist government and about the operation of Sharia law.
