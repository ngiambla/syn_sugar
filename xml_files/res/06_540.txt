 That agreement, between Franklins and the applicant, involved them in jointly bringing proceedings, in the Supreme Court of Victoria, against the Lessor for unreasonably withholding consent to the assignment of the lease of the Mentone store to the applicant.
 The applicant also submits that Franklins did not disclose to the applicant the fact that it had made a confidential submission to the ACCC on 23 November 2001, seeking the ACCC's consent for the sale of the Mentone store to Coles.
 That deal was said to consist of an "in principle agreement" whereby Franklins agreed to sell to Coles the stores that Coles wanted to acquire at prices to be determined by a formula, or specifically agreed, unless it proved beyond Franklins' power to sell the stores to Coles.
