 By virtue of these amendments no part of the Applicant's health insurance business was capable of being transferred to another organisation except under a scheme confirmed by the Court (see s 190(1A)). 12 Part 9 of the Act entitled 'Transfers and amalgamations of life insurance business' applies to the transfer of the Applicant's Health Benefits Fund to AHM.
 Section 190(3) of the Act provides: '190(3) A scheme must set out: (a) the terms of the agreement ... under which the proposed transfer ... is to be carried out; and (b) particulars of any other arrangements necessary to give effect to the scheme. ' 14 By letters dated 30 September 2005 to APRA, PHIAC and the Minister, the Applicant gave each of the persons mentioned a copy of the agreement made 9 September 2005, a draft Scheme of arrangement, a summary of the draft Scheme of arrangement, an actuarial report of a Mr Stevenson of 12 September 2005, an auditor's report of Mr Lewis of 8 September 2005, a draft form of public notice, draft benefit fund rules and a covering letter to members advising of the Scheme.
 By letter dated 22 March 2006, which bears the stamped date 23 March 2006, APRA approved a summary of the Scheme, advised its requirements in respect of publication of Notice of intention to apply for confirmation of the Scheme and approved the form of the Notice of intention to apply for confirmation of the Scheme for advertisement purposes.
 The Applicant, as a company affected by the scheme, was entitled to bring the application in accordance with ss 193(1) , (2) and (4) of the Act, and APRA, PHIAC and the Minister for Health and Ageing are entitled to be heard on the application. 17 When the matter was called for hearing earlier today, the Minister did not appear.
