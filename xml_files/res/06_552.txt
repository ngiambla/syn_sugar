 1 These reasons concern outstanding costs on a notice of motion of the first and second respondents dated 3 February 2005 and a re-amended notice of motion of the third and fourth respondents dated 21 December 2004 (filed in its original form on 25 October 2004 and amended on same date). 2 These notices of motion were heard on 3 February 2006 and orders were made that the sole director/shareholder of the first applicant, Mr Alan Duncan furnish various undertakings to the Court.
 Orders were then made for the parties to file written submissions in relation to the outstanding costs, that is, in relation to the second, third and fourth applicants. 3 The first and second respondents' notice of motion as filed sought, amongst other things, that the applicants' amended statement of claim be struck out and security for costs be given by all applicants.
 At the hearing on 3 February 2006 only [3] of the notice of motion remained before the Court, that is, the portion seeking security for costs having by then being only directed to the first applicant. 4 The third and fourth respondents' notice of motion as filed sought, amongst other things, that parts of the applicants' amended statement of claim be struck out, for deconsolidation of the proceeding and for security for costs from the first applicant.
 It is submitted that no order was made on the hearing of the notice of motion on 8 February 2006 as between the first applicant and the third and fourth respondents, presumably because the Court intended that those costs would follow the hearing of the remaining part of the notice of motion, that is, the security for costs application.
