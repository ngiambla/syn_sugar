 The Board also notes in this paragraph that in the case of conflict between the law and standards, the law must prevail. 9 The applicant says that the error is encapsulated in the following statement in sub-paragraph (g) of par 5.4: '(g) The result is that if, on an objective view, the relationship when created, results in a real possibility of impairment of independence then the definition will apply, and CWS was a related practice.

 In failing to investigate and consider the circumstances of particular appointments, and by accepting the relationship and the potential for conflict as the decisive consideration, it is at least reasonably arguable that the Board applied the test at too high a level of generality. 17 In my view, there is a serious question to be tried in this matter arising from the way in which the issue dividing the parties was formulated in the Board's reasons for determination.
