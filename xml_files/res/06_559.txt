 A direction pursuant to s 424 of the Corporations Act that on the facts and in the circumstances presently known to them, it is not improper or unlawful for the plaintiffs to enter into a contract of sale dated 17 January 2006 ('Contract') between Lake Federation Pty Ltd (receivers and managers appointed) and TIGA (Ballarat) Pty Ltd (ACN 117 812 030) ('TIGA') in respect of the property described in Schedule 1 of the Contact, notwithstanding the relationship between TIGA and the Receiver's appointor, Thorney Properties (Ballarat) Pty Ltd (ACN 106 693 725). ' 3 It is convenient to refer to the above as the 'original form' of relief sought.
 This is so notwithstanding that the directors have been joined in the proceeding as defendants and filed material opposing the making of the direction in the original form. 22 A number of cases indicate that a direction under s 424 of the Corporations Act has the limited force I have described.
 I also note that Austin J used the expression 'solely by reason of' in Actwane . 39 Like Austin J in One.Tel and Hodson J in Vartex , I would stress that the direction is intended to establish only that the Contract is not unlawful by reason of the relationship between TIGA and Thorney.
