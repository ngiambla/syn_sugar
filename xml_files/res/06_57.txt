 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of 27 October 2005 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal").
 On 10 December 2003, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ("the Minister") refusing to grant the appellant a protection visa.
 However, in this appeal, counsel for the Minister has properly drawn attention to a potential argument available to the appellant concerning the operation of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ").
 The second matter concerned his having travelled to New Zealand before coming to Australia, having not claimed asylum in New Zealand and having only claimed asylum on his third visit to Australia.
