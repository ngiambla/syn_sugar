 He said that AWB engaged Dr Sandman to advise about, and assist in the drafting of, a proposed statement of contrition by AWB as part of its response to the Inquiry and which might form the basis of some evidence to be given by Mr Lindberg.
 DECLARATORY RELIEF 184 From what appears above, it will be apparent that I reject AWB's claims for a declaration that Exhibit 665 is protected by legal professional privilege and for injunctions restraining the Commissioner from using or publishing Exhibit 665 and requiring that he return it to AWB.
 It remains for me to consider AWB's claim for declarations that the Commissioner does not have power to order the production of a privileged document or to determine whether a document is protected by legal professional privilege and should not determine such a claim. 185 Despite the widely formulated declarations sought by AWB, there was very little in dispute in this Court between AWB and the Commonwealth concerning the nature and extent of the Commissioner's powers under the RCA.
 AWB accepted that the Commissioner could quite properly hear argument and evidence about, and could accept or reject, a claim of legal professional privilege in the exercise of administrative or executive power, subject to the qualification that his decision would not have any legally binding force or effect.
