 For that reason, their Honours said that that applied to limitations which previously were to be seen in common law principles governing the grant of new trials upon proof of fresh evidence or from some other source. 9 Significantly, for the purposes of this appeal, their Honours (197 CLR 201-202 [111]) pointed out that another consideration is that the discretion given to an appellate Court hearing an appeal against an order made is the exercise of original jurisdiction, in this case by the Federal Magistrates Court.
 Their Honours said that it was highly unlikely that the Parliament, in conferring jurisdiction on a Full Court to hear appeals, intended that the analogue to s 27 should be construed in a way that would have the practical effect of obliterating the distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction, and continued: 'Nor can the availability of further evidence relevant to the issues in the appeal be treated as equivalent to a ground of appeal, proof of which prima facie entitles the appellant to a new trial.
 Counsel for the Minister faintly submitted that he may have wished to explore whether the account of the relationship between the migration adviser, Mr Sardar, and the appellant was correct. 12 Had I received the fresh evidence on appeal and Mr Reilly tested the appellant's account in cross-examination, or by obtaining concessions which counsel for the appellant indicated he may be able to make in respect of questions Mr Reilly might have wanted to put, I do not consider that those matters would have the result that appeal would be able to be decided in favour of the appellant on the basis of this fresh evidence, or that at the end of the day, it may not have been necessary to have a new trial altogether had this had any relevance. 13 I am of opinion that the introduction of this evidence, at this late stage, would not be in the interests of justice for the purposes of determining this appeal.
