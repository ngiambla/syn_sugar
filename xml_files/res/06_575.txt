 Mr Soh has no assets in Australia and the evidence is that he is impecunious. 3 The Commonwealth expresses concern that, should judgment be given in its favour in the substantive proceedings, it will not be able to enforce a costs order against the applicant in Korea.
 I am not persuaded that I should exercise the discretion conferred by O 28, r3(1)(a) to make an order for security for costs as asked by the respondent. ' Extra-territorial residence of the applicant 6 Order 28 r 3 of the Federal Court Rules provides that, when considering an application for security for costs, the Court may take into account, among other things, that the applicant 'is ordinarily resident outside Australia'.
 The applicant submitted that it would be a curious result that an impecunious person within jurisdiction could not be ordered to pay a security, but one outside the jurisdiction could, when the place of residence does not affect the impecuniosity.
