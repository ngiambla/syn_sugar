 It was said that, because Ms Antipova was not given a proper opportunity to give evidence and present arguments, the Tribunal had failed to comply with its statutory obligation to invite Ms Antipova to appear before it for a hearing of the kind contemplated by that subsection.
 The distinction between 'the genuineness of the relationship' and 'the 12 months co-habitation period' was plainly a false distinction, because reg 1.15A(2)(d)(ii) of the Migration Regulations required that Ms Antipova establish that, during the 12-month period, the relationship was 'genuine and continuing'.
 The Tribunal's decision is therefore tainted by jurisdictional error, either because of its failure to comply with s 360 of the Migration Act , or because of a denial of procedural fairness, which s 357A of the Migration Act does not exclude from consideration.
