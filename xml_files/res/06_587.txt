 That letter did not set out any information of that nature set out in the letter of 6 November 2002, that the appellant would be giving oral evidence or presenting arguments in support of his claims, or that he could ask the Tribunal, once again, to obtain oral evidence from other persons in order to set out a Response to Hearing Invitation form.
 That application claimed a declaration that the decision of the Tribunal was not a privative clause decision, it was made in excess of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and was consequently an order of no effect and sought mandamus, requiring the Tribunal to hear and determine the matter according to law. 23 The grounds for the application asserted an excess of jurisdiction or a constructive failure to exercise the jurisdiction by asking a wrong question regarding persecution and not taking into consideration 'the oral evidence that was given by the RRT hearing'.
 His Honour also set out at [13] that on 10 November 2004, prior to the hearing at which Emmett J dismissed the application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal, the Court had received a facsimile request from the applicant stating: 'Unfortunately from this afternoon I did not feel good.
 I am not physically not fit for appear before your Honour abovementioned hearing date tomorrow (Medical Certificate attached). ' 27 His Honour found that the medical certificate stated that the appellant was suffering from severe viral upper respiratory tract infection and would be unfit for work/school/Court attendance from 10/11/04 to 12/11/04.
