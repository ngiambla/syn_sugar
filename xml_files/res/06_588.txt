 However I am satisfied that it was open to me under O 35A and/or the general powers conferred by s 23 of the Federal Court Act , to hear and dismiss the application on a non-appearance of the applicants.
 In my opinion it is also open to me in the exercise of the general powers conferred by s 23 to set aside the order which I made in the absence of the applicants so that they may argue their case for leave to appeal. 8 It is unnecessary to set out again the factual and procedural history which is set out in the reasons for judgment published on 1 May 2006 --- Applicant S1140/2003 v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 526.
 It makes reference to s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which was not in force at the time of the Tribunal's decision. 11 The grounds of the amended application do not assist the applicants.
