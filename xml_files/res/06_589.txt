 Morley and Beechboro Practices received 40% as management fees. (3) That the period of disqualification be discharged.

' 26 On 28 February 2005, a firm of solicitors (not Mr Ayoub) gave notice of appointment to act on behalf of the applicant.
 On 17 June 2005, the applicant's current solicitors filed a notice of change of solicitors. 27 On 30 September 2005, the applicant filed a minute of an amended application for review whereby the applicant sought to join as respondents to the application the members of the Committee and the Director, and to include an application to review and set aside the determination made by the Committee in its final report.
 The position of the applicant in limiting his challenge to the draft determination to the proposed full disqualification for two months penalty, is consistent with his conduct in not seeking to impugn the final report of the Committee by way of an application for review; and, indeed, with his position at the time of the filing of the application for review in this Court on 10 February 2005.
 In my view, the Committee answered the complaint in its final report and there is no merit in the complaint made by the applicant on this ground. 56 I am unable to conclude that there is merit in the proposed grounds that the applicant did not have sufficient time to prepare for the hearing and that the complaint was not sufficiently particularised.
