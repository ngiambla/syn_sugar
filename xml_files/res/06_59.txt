 He contends that his Christian journey commenced before that and that his interest in Christianity which preceded his conversion from the Islamic faith provided a basis for his claim, since his arrival here, of refugee status. 2 His application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa was rejected by the Minister's Delegate.
 The Respondent Minister submits that the Appellant is in truth seeking no more than a merits review and that no ground has been made out warranting the issue of constitutional writs. 4 The Appellant does not seek to rely on his conversion and baptism to justify his claimed refugee status, nor does he rely upon the reasons for his departure from Iran to justify that status.
 The Applicant claims that on the strength of this personal conversation among his friends when at home for ten days his interest in Christianity became public knowledge such that a fellow crew member on the ship knew of the Applicant's Christian leanings and informed the Captain.
