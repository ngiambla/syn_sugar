 In the Amended Application filed on 6 April 2006, the applicants set out, in more than thirty paragraphs and sub-paragraphs, a series of categories of documents of which they seek preliminary discovery in addition to the documents which have already been produced. 5 The applicants say that the documents necessary to prepare earning statements evidencing revenues and expenses in respect of the distribution of the film are within the possession of the respondents.
 For present purposes the respondents do not dispute that there may be a cause of action in contract, but say this is not sufficient to ground jurisdiction for the grant of preliminary discovery because it lacks the necessary federal element to satisfy r 6(a) so that there is a right to relief in the Federal Court.
 I do not consider that the respondents' case on discovery is materially weakened by the fact that Ms Douglas and Mr Knight were not cross-examined, given the nature of the application, their current residence overseas, and the fact that their detailed workings only came to light relatively recently. 29 In relation to r 6(c), the respondents also argue that the classes of documents sought have not been shown to be relevant to the question of whether the applicant has the right to obtain relief.
 I also consider that having regard to what has already been produced and the degree to which it has been able to be analysed and formulated, albeit with substantial reservations, this is not a case where a convincing argument has been made out for preliminary discovery of the documents sought.
