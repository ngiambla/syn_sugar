 I do not consider that the respondents' case on discovery is materially weakened by the fact that Ms Douglas and Mr Knight were not cross-examined, given the nature of the application, their current residence overseas, and the fact that their detailed workings only came to light relatively recently. 29 In relation to r 6(c), the respondents also argue that the classes of documents sought have not been shown to be relevant to the question of whether the applicant has the right to obtain relief.
 I also consider that having regard to what has already been produced and the degree to which it has been able to be analysed and formulated, albeit with substantial reservations, this is not a case where a convincing argument has been made out for preliminary discovery of the documents sought.
