 The eighth and ninth respondents are solicitors in the firm of Johnson, Winter and Slattery, solicitors for the seventh respondent, the National Australia Bank. 9 Mr Slattery relied upon an affidavit sworn by Scott Alexander Evans, the ninth respondent, in support of the eighth and ninth respondents' applications to summarily dismiss the proceeding.
 I am not satisfied that they give any proper particulars which would enable the first respondent, who has a responsibility of considering this application, to respond to the application at all. 21 Section 31A of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) now provides the test for summary judgment in a proceeding.
