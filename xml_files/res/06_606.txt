 1 On 1 May 2006, the Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation ("the Corporation") and members of its governing committee brought an application for an order for review against a decision made by the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations appointing an administrator to the Corporation under s 71 of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Act ").
 The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, by request dated 4 May 2006, sought leave to inspect the application for an order of review and the affidavits filed by both parties to that date, and the Centralian Advocate , by application dated 8 May 2006, sought leave to inspect the affidavits served by the Registrar.
 An inspection of the documents and subsequent publication may cause similar harm and therefore prejudice that application. 8 The Registrar did not support or oppose the application, but her counsel helpfully referred me to three authorities relevant to the determination of the issue. 9 On 17 May 2006, I granted leave to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to inspect the affidavits of Mr Glendle Schrader, sworn on 29 April 2006 and 3 May 2006, Mr Graham Harbord, sworn on 29 April 2006 and 3 May 2006, and Mr Armstrong, sworn on 4 May 2006.
 In that regard, I refer to the articles which have appeared in the Alice Springs News and the Centralian Advocate in late February and early March 2006. 16 In light of these factors, the matters advanced by the Corporation and other applicants cannot be considered to be exceptional circumstances justifying a refusal of leave. 17 It was for these reasons that on 17 May 2006 I granted leave for the inspection of the affidavits referred to above.
