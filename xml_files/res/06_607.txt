 His Honour relied upon s 39(6) of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth) (' Federal Magistrates Act ') which provides 'An appeal does not lie from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court in relation to the transfer of a proceeding under subsection (1)'.
 Section 39(1) of the Federal Magistrates Act provides that 'if a proceeding is pending in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Magistrates Court may, by order, transfer the proceeding from the Federal Magistrates Court to the Federal Court or the Family Court'.
 That application was dismissed with costs by Heydon J on 9 December 2004. 23 On 19 November 2004 the applicant commenced proceedings in the High Court seeking an order nisi for the issue of the constitutional writs and associated relief relating again to the order transferring proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court and for pro bono representation for the applicant.
