 The Tribunal found that, given the seriousness of those charges, the appellant would be wanted for at least questioning by the appropriate authorities in Bangladesh and that the police there had a legitimate reason to issue an arrest warrant and visit his house immediately after the incident.
 This was before the Tribunal sent a letter of 23 September 2003 to the appellant stating that it had considered the material before it but "was unable to make a decision in your favour on this information alone" and advising of the date, time and place of a hearing, as required by s 425.
 Read in context, the passage quoted above at [37] above was no more than an account by the Tribunal of the way the hearing took the course it did and why it then proceeded to question the appellant in detail about his involvement with the Awami League.
 If an applicant "gave" the "information" for the purpose of the Tribunal review application (in contrast to SAAP , where the Tribunal had obtained the information from a witness other than the applicant) that is something necessarily within the knowledge of the applicant himself.
