 1 In these proceedings for a native title determination, Warren James Parkinson and Judith Anne Parkinson ('the Parkinsons') seek to be joined pursuant to s 84(3)(b) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Native Title Act '). 2 The required notice of the non-claimant application has been given under s 66 of the Native Title Act .
 Joinder under the Native Title Act 13 Whether or not the Parkinsons are entitled to be joined in these proceedings depends on whether their ' interests may be affected by a determination in the proceeding '; s 84(3)(a)(ii) of the Native Title Act . 14 Section 84 of the Native Title Act prescribes the parties to a native title determination application.
 The latter condition has been established. 15 The Full Court held in Byron Environment Centre Incorporated v Arakwal People (1997) 148 ALR 46 that interests which could entitle a person to become a party to the application under s 84 are not confined to the interests referred to in s 253 of the Native Title Act in relation to land or waters.
 To the contrary, the consensual objects of the Act would seem to be advanced if a person with genuine interests of that nature that might or would be affected did have the rights of involvement in the process of native title determination given by the Act to a person who is a party.
