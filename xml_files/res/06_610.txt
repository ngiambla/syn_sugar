 The loss of those fees and bonuses was further alleged to have arisen because Star Kitchens had failed to comply with their delivery and installation obligations within the times specified by their agreement with FMA. 4 On 8 April 2004 Magistrate Elms upheld Star Kitchen's claim against Mr Pacer ('the Local Court judgment').
 I will discuss those further Local Court proceedings in more detail shortly, since their existence bears significantly upon the issues arising in Mr Pacer's application to set aside the abovementioned bankruptcy notice. 7 Mr Pacer's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the Local Court judgment was dismissed by Rothman J on 22 June 2005 with costs.
 There is no apparent evidence to indicate that Mr Pacer was served with that certificate of judgment, or had it otherwise brought to his attention by Star Kitchens, for what that might ultimately matter. 8 Star Kitchens then filed the bankruptcy notice on 24 August 2005 and personally caused the same to be served (as stated above) upon Mr Pacer on 29 August 2005.
 In that regard it seems likely that the figure of $27,354.32 recorded in the certificate of judgment, which was of course issued on 16 August 2005, incorporated the interest outstanding on the $19,820 judgment, calculated from 12 May 2000 to 16 August 2005, as ordered by the Magistrate.
