 The loss of those fees and bonuses was further alleged to have arisen because Star Kitchens had failed to comply with their delivery and installation obligations within the times specified by their agreement with FMA. 4 On 8 April 2004 Magistrate Elms upheld Star Kitchen's claim against Mr Pacer ('the Local Court judgment').
