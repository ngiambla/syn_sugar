 Given that the final report has now been completed and those parts of the document which are referable to the applicant have already been provided to him, it is not immediately obvious that, if the reports were released for the limited purpose of these proceedings, APRA's investigations would be prejudiced.
 It appears that the evidence-gathering stage of the investigation is wholly completed and the decision is now a forensic and/or legal one. 54 Similarly, no indication has been given to the Court as to whether the draft reports actually contain the identity of informers or information which was provided confidentially.
 If this were the only basis on which APRA claimed production should be refused, then I would require evidence of the precise basis on which it is claimed in respect of these particular reports, or would need to evaluate the reports myself. 56 There was one further consideration raised by APRA which I consider to be significant.
