 The first Tribunal said (at [60]): 'While their methods may have been suspect, I am satisfied that the police were involved in the legitimate exercise of their police duties and were not subjecting the Applicant to persecution for a Convention reason.
 It failed to do that. (3) The Federal Magistrate erred by not holding that Tribunal made jurisdictional error in interpreting and applying what is meant by serious harm and held that what Applicant suffered was not persecution.
