 The applicant alleged that this constituted an error of law on the basis that it was not reasonably open to the Tribunal to conclude that the harm suffered by the applicant was anything other than serious and, accordingly, the Tribunal should have found that the criteria in s 91R(1)(b) and (c) of the Act were satisfied.
 The applicant contended that the criminal activities directed at his family were instigated, and were successful, because the criminals knew that the State would fail to offer protection to the applicant and his family due to their Pakistani ethnicity.
