 Unless 'maximum engagement' were similarly regarded as referring to the maximum period of reservation of employees' time, that is to say, the spread of hours during which paid work and requisite unpaid meal breaks should occur, there would be no obstacle to the employer requiring an employee to reserve, say, 14 hours' continuous time during which only 12 hours of paid working time might be achieved.
 That, given the Agreement as a whole, would appear both unjust and not in accordance with the probable intention of the parties. 12 The employer, until this challenge, paid the employees (including Mr Hau) 12 hours' pay, but Mr Hau did not work in any of those notified rostered periods more than 11 and a half hours and quite frequently worked 11 hours and 15 minutes on what I might call 'actual on-floor, fully operational security work'.
 Counsel for the employer suggests that this may be done by regarding the word 'engagement' as referring to a choice by an employer of the number of hours during which it might require the employee to perform actual work with the consequent obligation on it to pay for those hours. 14 The Union, as indicated, argued that the context of the term 'engagement' as used in cl 19 should be seen as referring to a spread of hours to include the time necessarily taken for requisite unpaid meal breaks.
 Counsel for the appellant points out that the term 'engagement' which normally does mean reserving an employee's time for a certain period and undertaking to pay for it, differs from the notion of 'notified roster times' in cl 27 which is used in a context suggesting that it is the notified roster times which, as a practical matter, would constitute the spread of hours for ordinary time payment purposes. 15 Further, there are limits on the extent of such possible notified roster times beyond which something more than ordinary time payment would have to be made.
