 Those principles include the establishment of employment processes to ensure that public sector employees are treated fairly and reasonably and that public sector employees have a reasonable avenue of redress against unfair or unreasonable treatment: see s 8(b) and (d). 15 Section 22 of the Act provides that the Regulations may establish procedures for dealing with any allegation of misconduct on the part of the employee and empower the imposition of penalties for misconduct.
 Regulation 8 provides that: 'If --- (a) an employee applies for an initial review; and (b) the public sector body fails to commence the initial review within 30 days after receiving the application --- the employee may apply to the Public Sector Standards Commissioner for review of the failure to commence the initial review. ' 24 Regulation 10 deals with the conduct of a review by the Public Sector Standards Commissioner.
 These provisions may be of little comfort to the applicant because the review by the Public Sector Standards Commissioner is limited to a review of the failure to commence the initial review and, by virtue of s 65(1) of the Act, the Public Standards Commissioner does not have power to make a binding decision as a result of the review.
