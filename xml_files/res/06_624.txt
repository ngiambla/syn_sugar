 On 20 December 2004 the appellant made a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ('HREOC') in respect of the conduct of several of his former work colleagues, which he alleged amounted to sexual harassment within the meaning of s 28A of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) ('SDA').
 The appellant simultaneously made a complaint against the respondent on the basis of s 106 of the SDA, pursuant to which an employer is vicariously liable for the conduct of its employees. 2 The complaint against the respondent was terminated by the President of HREOC on 1 June 2005.
 The appellant submitted that Driver FM misconstrued the requirements for vicarious liability under the SDA, and accordingly misconceived the merits of the appellant's application. 21 The complaint made by the appellant to HREOC concerned alleged conduct by employees of the respondent which constituted sexual harassment.
