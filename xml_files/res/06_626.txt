 NO ORDER FOR SEPARATE DETERMINATION 10 Regrettably, his Honour did not make an order for the separate determination of the proceeding so far as it related to the appellant's complaint about Mr Xiao's conduct and any liability that the University might have had flowing from that conduct.
 Before forming such a view, over the opposition of the parties and, where appropriate, their legal representatives, a trial judge would obviously need to consider whether the conscious choice of the parties not to call the witness properly can be overborne by the court while preserving the appearance and actuality of judicial impartiality.
 As Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ said in Vakauta v Kelly [1989] HCA 44 ; (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 573: 'An experienced lawyer would appreciate the ability of a trial judge to ensure that preconceived views do not cause the actual decision to be tainted by prejudgment or bias.
 His Honour said that the allegations appeared to extend to unnecessary and probably inappropriate attempts at service upon Mr Xiao by the appellant and Ms Wang ([2005] FMCA 463 at [7]). 72 The reason why Ms Wang was not available for cross-examination is that she had been in Singapore when, again, on 5 April 2005 the appellant sought to have her attend for cross-examination (see appellant's submissions par 194).
