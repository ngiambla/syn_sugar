 The appellant appeals from his Honour's judgment. 10 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant's primary argument was that the Tribunal, by considering the possibility of relocation and concealing his whereabouts from relatives, was requiring him to avoid harm by acting discreetly in the practise of his religion.
 The appellant now claims that the Tribunal erred when it "did not disclose certain adverse information as required by s 424A(1)" and that this information was ... "[t]he educational history of the [appellant] provided in his application for a protection visa".
 The information given at the Tribunal hearing fell within the exclusion in s 424A(3)(b) of the Act. 31 For present purposes, I accept that the Tribunal's finding that it was reasonable for the appellant to relocate because he "is well educated and has demonstrated sufficient personal resourcefulness to enable him to settle here" was a part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision.
