 I will hereafter call him 'the trustee'. 2 The principal point on this application is whether the sum of $115,000 payable by the applicant by way of costs by order of a Magistrate in the Magistrates Court of South Australia of 13 February 2004 (the costs order), shortly before his bankruptcy, is a debt provable in the applicant's bankruptcy.
 He was also given leave to join, and has joined, WorkCover as the entity in whose favour the costs order was made and Stephen Brady as the Manager, Penalty Management under the Magistrates Court Act 1991 (SA) and the person charged with recovering the costs order.
 In that case the relevant liability comprised a fine imposed for certain offences under the Game Act 1928 (Vic) and the costs ordered to be paid (although the judgment does not separately address the characteristics of that part of the orders dealing with costs).
 Hence, s 60(1) has been found to be available to stay the enforcement of an order to make restitution, or to stay that part of the order imposing consequences for non-compliance with a condition in a recognisance requiring restitution.
