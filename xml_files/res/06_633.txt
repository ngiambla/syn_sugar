 His claim for a protection visa was founded on the contention that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of his membership of the Marxist Leninist Naxalite party. 8 The notice of appeal alleged a number of jurisdictional errors.
 The appellant's written submissions argued that the Tribunal ignored the appellant's claim that he was not in the violent group of Naxalites and that, rather, he was a member of a moderate group associated with the Naxalite movement, which operated in the Punjab fighting for the rights of the peasants and common masses. 12 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal discredited the appellant's claims and ultimately rejected them on credibility grounds because of its view that the Naxalite movement was committed to violence.
 It was open to the Tribunal to conclude, as it did, that it was not satisfied that the appellant was a wanted Naxalite and it was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution in India. 18 A second ground of appeal raised on behalf of the appellant went to the related question whether the Tribunal had fallen into error by consulting independent country information about the Naxalite movement.
