 The trustee has concluded that this property was not partnership property. 9 In realising the assets of the bankrupts the trustee (i) sold (a) the Bordertown property which produced a net balance of $115,377.00; and (b) the Hayborough property for which the net balance was $146,653.93; and (ii) has received partnership assets amounting approximately to $230,800.
 There are, it seems, creditors whose proofs have been admitted for all of the estates except for Marlene's separate estate. 11 Some number of the creditors, by virtue of their contracts with the partnership and its members which impose joint and several liability, are creditors of both the joint partnership estate and the partners' separate estates.
 And it does so because as between the joint tenants no act was done by, or to, either or both of the bankrupts other than the bankruptcy itself and its s 58 consequence which could require that the property no longer be considered as joint property to be applied in the payment of their joint debts.
 I do not consider that the section requires that construction, hence my agreement with the dictum in Re Francis . 25 Having reached this conclusion I would have to say, though, that I have some difficulty in seeing a principled operation for the right of survivorship of a joint tenant were one of the bankrupts to die during the course of the administration either before or after the jointly owned property was sold. 26 Accordingly, I would direct that the interests of Colin and Marlene as joint tenants in both the Bordertown and Hayborough properties be allocated to the joint estate of Colin and Marlene, this being the only joint estate of which they alone are joint debtors.
