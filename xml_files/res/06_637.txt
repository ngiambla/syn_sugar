 Delivered Ex Tempore at 4.00 pm 1 On 28 April 2006, I pronounced orders pending trial in an application by Notice of Motion by the Applicant in the proceedings for a Mareva Order and other orders. 2 On 3 May 2006 I published reasons in relation to the orders made on 28 April 2006.
 On 28 April 2006 I also made directions orders by consent which require the Second Respondent to give discovery of documents by 4.00 pm 26 May 2006. 4 In order to enable discovery to take place in conformity with the timetable, the documents in question have been returned to the solicitors for the Second Respondent. 5 An order had been prepared making provision for the return of the documents delivered to the court in accordance with the order of Spender J.
 The order is that the solicitors for the Second Respondent shall have leave to take possession of all documents produced to the court pursuant to the order of his Honour Justice Spender on 15 November 2005 to be held in the custody and control of the solicitors for the Second Respondent pending the trial of the action or earlier order.
