 Put another way, PCL submitted that 'at the relevant time', there was no claim as such then pending, because it was implicitly acknowledged in those letters of 23 April 2004 and 13 May 2004, written on behalf of PCL (during of course the terms of the first policy being 26 July 2003 to 26 July 2004), that there was no basis for any claim to indemnity unless certain further events transpired or crystallised by way of sale by PCL as mortgagee exercising power of sale.
 The PCL letters as to the possibility or likelihood (however the same may be construed on a final hearing) of commencement or proceedings were sent on behalf of PCL on 23 April 2004 and 13 May 2004 to Mr Teves personally, and hence were sent during the currency of the Macquarie insurance policy for the year of indemnity 26 July 2003 to 26 July 2004 (ie that which I have been referring to as the first policy).
 As I have earlier recorded, Mr Teves was apparently a director and shareholder of ARMA, although that circumstance appears not yet to have been formally established. 39 It appears however that PCL's loss by way of shortfall in recoupment of its mortgage indebtedness the subject of the intended claims against ARMA and Mr Teves did not crystallise until sometime during the following year of indemnity from 26 July 2004 to 26 July 2005, that is to say, during the currency of the second policy.
