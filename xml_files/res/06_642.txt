 The first appeal is brought by Mr Stephen Cooper (NSD 61 of 2006) and the second appeal is brought by E-Talk Communications Pty Ltd ("E-Talk") and Mr Leon Francis Bal (NSD 150 of 2006). 2 The first order sought by the record companies in relation to appeal NSD 61 of 2006 is that Mr Cooper provide security for the record companies' costs of the proposed appeal in such amount as the Court considers fit.
 Order 52 r 20 of the Federal Court Rules also illustrates that a Court or a Judge may make an order for security for costs of an appeal. 4 In this matter, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for me to consider the question of security and not refer the matter to a Full Court.
 For the reasons given at [3] --- [6] above, I reject this submission. 24 Counsel also submits that, as there has been no order that evidence in one appeal should be evidence in the other, the affidavit of Mr Williams should be disregarded.
 Therefore, I do not propose to make an order for security for costs against Mr Bal, having regard to the inadequacy of the evidence on this aspect. 28 As to quantum, I am not persuaded that an order should be made for security for costs in the sum of $201,000.00.
