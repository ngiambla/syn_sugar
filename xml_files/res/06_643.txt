 1 On 1 June 1998, the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") affirmed a decision made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ("the Minister") on 12 May 1997 not to grant the applicant a protection visa under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). 2 The applicant filed an application for an order nisi in the High Court of Australia on 29 May 2003 requesting the respondents to show cause why constitutional writs should not be issued in respect of the decision of the Tribunal.
 DISCUSSION 9 In the draft order nisi filed in the High Court, the applicant claims that the Tribunal failed to afford the applicant natural justice because he had not been given an opportunity (or an adequate opportunity) to prepare and present favourable material at hearing or an adequate opportunity to respond to unfavourable material.
 The Tribunal recognised that the applicant's representative had referred in support of these submissions to a paper of the Documentation, Information and Research Branch of the Immigration and Refugee Board entitled India: Information from four specialists on the Punjab and published in Ottawa in February 1997 as well as a report from United Press International dated 29 January 1996.
 In its discussion of the independent country information, the Tribunal extracted a passage from the first of these documents to the effect that people who are not high profile militant suspects are not at risk from the police in the Punjab today. 21 On the material before me, the applicant has not made out an arguable case that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error. 22 The application for an order nisi should therefore be dismissed with costs.
