 The Tribunal recognised that the applicant's representative had referred in support of these submissions to a paper of the Documentation, Information and Research Branch of the Immigration and Refugee Board entitled India: Information from four specialists on the Punjab and published in Ottawa in February 1997 as well as a report from United Press International dated 29 January 1996.
 In its discussion of the independent country information, the Tribunal extracted a passage from the first of these documents to the effect that people who are not high profile militant suspects are not at risk from the police in the Punjab today. 21 On the material before me, the applicant has not made out an arguable case that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error. 22 The application for an order nisi should therefore be dismissed with costs.
