 1 On 22 December 2005, I dismissed an appeal in this matter by Yasmin Sheikh and made no order as to costs. 2 The respondent now seeks an order for costs on the basis that the normal rule - that costs follow the outcome - should apply. 3 The appellant resists the order for costs and submits that no specific application for costs was made by the respondent at the hearing.
 Therefore, the appellant says that the question of costs should not be reopened. 5 The appellant also submits that litigation under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (" SRC Act ") is not properly viewed as adversary litigation, even though the process may manifest some characteristics of such litigation. 6 In this case, the fact that no order is made as to costs simply means what it says, namely, that there has been no order made.
 Accordingly, it is open to the respondent to approach the Court for an order for costs at this later stage. 7 I appreciate that the litigation is essentially not adversarial in character and this is a factor that can be taken into account when exercising the Court's broad discretion in relation to costs.
 Counsel for the appellant submitted that this is consistent with the nature of the statutory process where an injured worker seeks to assert a statutory right against an authority charged with administering legislation for the benefit of such workers as outlined in subs 67(8) of the SRC Act . 9 In this case, the appellant has already unsuccessfully ventilated her complaint before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and has failed on the appeal to this Court.
