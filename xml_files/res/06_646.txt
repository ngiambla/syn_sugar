 1 On 22 December 2005, I dismissed an appeal in this matter by Yasmin Sheikh and made no order as to costs. 2 The respondent now seeks an order for costs on the basis that the normal rule - that costs follow the outcome - should apply. 3 The appellant resists the order for costs and submits that no specific application for costs was made by the respondent at the hearing.
 Therefore, the appellant says that the question of costs should not be reopened. 5 The appellant also submits that litigation under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (" SRC Act ") is not properly viewed as adversary litigation, even though the process may manifest some characteristics of such litigation. 6 In this case, the fact that no order is made as to costs simply means what it says, namely, that there has been no order made.
