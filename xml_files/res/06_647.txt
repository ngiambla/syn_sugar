 1 On 9 May 2006, I ordered, pursuant to Order 29 rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules , that two preliminary questions which arise in these proceedings be determined prior to, and separately from, all other issues in the proceedings. 2 The effect of the preliminary questions is to ask whether the applicant is estopped from alleging that the respondent's trade mark "Healthplus" ("the respondent's mark") is substantially identical or deceptively similar to the applicant's trade mark "Inner Health Plus" ("the Inner Health Plus Mark"). 3 The respondents contend that the estoppel arises from a decision of Cooper J in Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Limited [2005] FCA 5 ("the decision") which was handed down on 11 January 2005. 4 The decision was an appeal under s 56 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) ("the Act ") from a decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks dismissing the applicant's opposition to the respondent's mark.
 Those grounds raised the issue of whether the respondent's mark was substantially identical, or deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus mark. 6 Cooper J found that the respondent's mark was not substantially identical, or deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus Mark. 7 In the present proceedings, the applicant seeks, inter alia , an order under s 88 of the Act rectifying the Register of Trade Marks by cancelling the respondent's mark.
 It asserts that the respondent's mark is substantially identical or is deceptively similar to, the Inner Health Plus Mark. 9 The respondent contends that the applicant is estopped, by reason of the decision, from making this assertion or allegation in reliance on ss 42 and 60 in these proceedings. 10 The applicant seeks to meet this contention by pointing to the structure of the Act which provides in Division 2 of Part 8 for rectification proceedings on grounds which include grounds on which the registration of the mark could have been opposed.
 Is the applicant estopped in these proceedings by the decision of Cooper J delivered in Health World Limited v Shin-Sun Australia Pty Limited [2005] FCA 5 delivered 11 January 2005 (the 'Decision') from alleging that the trade mark 'HEALTHPLUS', the subject of Australian trade mark number 874755 (the 'Respondents' Mark'), is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark 'INNER HEALTH PLUS' in relation to which the pro-biotic products 'Inner Health Plus' and 'Inner Health Plus Dairy Free' manufactured by the applicant were marketed, sold and offered for sale in the period March 2000 to 7 May 2001. 2.
 Nevertheless, before making the orders, I raised with the parties my concern about the utility of the order in the present case. 18 Notwithstanding my doubts, I was persuaded by the submissions of the parties that the factors to which Branson J pointed in Reading Australia Pty Limited v Australian Mutual Provident Society [1999] FCA 718 , favoured the making of an order. 19 However, in light of an issue which emerged in the arguments of counsel on the hearing of the preliminary questions, I have serious doubts about whether the order should have been made.
 The reasons for judgment of Cooper J 26 His Honour was of the view that the test to be applied in considering an appeal under s 56 of the Act is whether the mark should clearly not be registered; see at [4] --- [6]. 27 In coming to that view his Honour referred to Lomas and to the decision of Bennett J in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Limited v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Limited [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 132 FCR 326 (" Torpedoes") in which her Honour applied the "should clearly not be registered" test.
 Accordingly, it has not been necessary to apply the higher standard that a ground of objection is clearly or undoubtedly correct. " 29 Cooper J went on to find at [40] --- [41] that the respondent's mark was not substantially identical or deceptively similar to the Inner Health Plus Mark at the priority date. 30 Thus, his Honour rejected the grounds of opposition under ss 42(b) and 60 of the Act.
 Discussion 31 For an issue estoppel to arise, (1) the same question of fact or law must necessarily have been decided; (2) by a judicial decision that was final; and (3) the parties to the earlier judicial decision or their privies must be the same persons as the parties in which the estoppel is raised; see Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 (" Kuligowski ") at [21]; Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 (" Blair v Curran ") at 531 --- 532. 32 There was no dispute about satisfaction of the third requirement.
 This is revealed in the description in Lomas at [18] of such proceedings as "quasi summary". 38 This debate turns upon the nature of the statutory scheme revealed in Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 4, Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 5 and Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 8 of the Act; see also ss 195 and 197 of the Act 39 Whether or not a decision in opposition proceedings can give rise to an issue estoppel must depend upon the proper construction of the statutory language and the necessary implications which flow from it; Kuligowski at [25], [36] and [37]. 40 Two Full Courts have stated in plain terms that if opposition proceedings fail, the validity of the trade mark can then be fully explored in revocation proceedings; see Lomas at [18] --- [19] and Woolworths v BP at [55]. 41 The same approach has been applied in patent proceedings; see Imperial Chemical Industries PLC v EI Dupont De Nemours Co [2002] AIPC 91-818 at [6] --- [7]. 42 In trade mark proceedings this approach seems to me to follow from the scheme of the Act and in particular from ss 88(1) and (2).
 Instead, his Honour was satisfied that the applicant failed on the balance of probabilities. 47 It is also true that this finding necessarily established the legal foundation or justification for the conclusion which his Honour reached; it was legally indispensable to the conclusion; see Blair v Curran at 531 --- 532. 48 However, the effect of what was said in Lomas is that under the statutory scheme which relates to opposition proceedings, the decision cannot be said to be final.
 The respondent must pay the costs of the O 29 r 2 hearing. 51 Nevertheless, whilst of course expressing no concluded view, the considerations pointed to by Gyles J in Clinique may well suggest that if the applicant fails at the final hearing on the grounds under ss 42 and 60, it would be appropriate for me to order that the costs of the final hearing, at least in relation to those issues, be paid by the applicant on an indemnity basis.
