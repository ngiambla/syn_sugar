 On 21 August 2005, that is to say nearly seven years later, he lodged an application for a protection visa claiming a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinion, namely his association with and participation in the Awami League. 10 The applicant claims to be a local leader of the Awami League and said that that led to him being physically harmed and he said that this was the reason why he left Bangladesh.
 He found that the application for review in the RRT adopted the claims made in the protection visa application. 19 The learned Magistrate at [7] then referred to an additional issue which was not raised by the appellant in his application for judicial review but which occurred to the Magistrate as a possible ground of review.
 This was that the RRT may have breached section 91R(3) of the Act in placing reliance upon the appellant's conduct in Australia without making an express finding that the appellant had satisfied the RRT that the conduct was engaged in otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to refugee status. 20 The learned Federal Magistrate's reasons are summed up in [10]-[13] of his judgment as follows:- "...The presiding member clearly had credibility concerns about the applicant's claims and the applicant's conduct in Australia tended to reinforce those credibility concerns.
 It is said that the section is designed to exclude evidence of conduct supporting a person's claim for persecution if that conduct was merely motivated by a desire to strengthen the claim the onus being on the appellant to satisfy the Minister that the conduct was not so motivated and it makes no sense to require the appellant to discharge the onus only to have the evidence then used against him.
