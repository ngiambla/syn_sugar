 On 5 October 2000, Moore J dismissed the application and ordered the applicant to pay the costs of the respondent. 3 On 17 June 2003, the applicant filed an application in the High Court of Australia for an order nisi requiring the respondents to show cause why constitutional writs should not be issued in respect of the decision of the Tribunal.
 DISCUSSION 7 Res judicata arises where a cause of action relied on in proceedings has, in former proceedings, passed into judgment so that it has merged and has no longer an independent existence: see Blair v Curren [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532 per Dixon J; Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589 at 597 per Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ ( Anshun ).
 The doctrine of res judicata represents a complete bar to a new application because the cause of action is extinguished by the judgment: see Anshun at 612-3 per Brennan J. 8 The question to be determined on a plea of res judicata is whether the cause of action relied upon in the proceedings in which the plea is raised is the same cause of action which has been determined in the earlier proceedings.
