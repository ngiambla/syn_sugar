 Rather, the SSAT had reasoned simply that the honours year would improve the respondent's prospects of obtaining suitable paid work, and that this justified treating the conditions under s 601(2) as though they were satisfied. 17 However, s 601(2) is actually more complex than this.
 Plainly, the AAT had in mind s 606(1)(g) in invoking this formula. 21 Paraphrasing the AAT's reasons for decision, the honours year of study in which the respondent had enrolled was regarded as a valuable activity, and one which should have been included in a Newstart Activity Agreement.
 It is simply that, in their different ways, the SSAT and the AAT both considered that the Secretary ought to have formed the opinion referred to in s 601(2) , or ought to have entered into a Newstart Activity Agreement with the respondent, allowing for the honours course. 28 In my view, neither the SSAT, nor the AAT, was entitled to conclude that the conditions under s 613(2) had been met in circumstances where manifestly they had not.
