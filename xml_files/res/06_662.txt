 The Minister sought the dismissal of the proceedings issued in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia by the applicant and relied on various rules of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Pt 13 r 13.10(a), (b) and (c)).
 The proceedings issued by the applicant that were the subject of the Minister's application were an application under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and Migration Act 1958 (Cth) seeking the review of the decision of a delegate of the Minister whereby the applicant was refused a protection visa. 3 The matter has a long history which is relevant to the present application and which I summarise as follows: 1.
 On 13 October 2005 the applicant lodged his current application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court to review the delegate's decision and that application was dismissed on 13 February 2006. 4 The Magistrate said that the applicant's application challenges the delegate's decision and she said it was doomed to fail because, among other things, the decision of the delegate was subsumed in the decision of the Tribunal. 5 I do not think that the applicant's proposed appeal enjoys any reasonable prospect of success.
 The Tribunal conducted a full merits review in relation to the decision of the delegate and the applicant was given every opportunity to present his case (see s 415 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344).
