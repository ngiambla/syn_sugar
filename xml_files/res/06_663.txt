 The Minister sought the dismissal of the proceedings issued in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia by the applicant and relied on various rules of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Pt 13 r 13.10(a), (b) and (c)).
 The Magistrate said that the applicant's application challenges the delegate's decision and he said that it was doomed to fail because the decision of the delegate was subsumed in the decision of the Tribunal. 3 I do not think that the applicant's proposed appeal enjoys any prospect of success.
 The Federal Magistrate found that the decision of the Tribunal was in no way affected by jurisdictional error and a judge of this court refused leave to appeal against that decision. 4 The delegate's decision is now of no significance having regard to the fact that it was reviewed by the Tribunal.
