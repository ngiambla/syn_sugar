 That matter was examined by the learned Federal Magistrate and determined contrary to the position of the applicant, based upon evidence which was set out in the judgment.
 The applicant has not pointed to any appealable error in the manner in which that issue was determined against him. 2 The learned Federal Magistrate also said that the gross delay in the proceeding would have been a proper basis to dismiss the matter peremptorily in any event.
 In my opinion, that is also a sound basis for dismissing the proceeding. 3 I can see no possible argument that the decision here could be successfully attacked upon appeal.
