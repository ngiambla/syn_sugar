 This assignment was registered by the Registrar of Designs on 7 December 1998. 8 In early 2000 Mr Shead and Mr Whiting decided to transfer the assets of Cellite Sales, including the registered design, to Carrera Lighting.
 Somewhat curiously the assignment was not registered in the Register of Designs until 23 March 2004 --- almost two years after the date of the assignment and only three days before a letter of demand was sent by the applicant to the respondent in relation to its alleged infringement of the registered design. 11 Counsel for the respondent said that I should find the assignment was executed in 2004 and backdated.
 I consider the presence of the step in the end caps to be a significant feature of the form and shape of the registered design which, together with other configuration features, distinguishes it from the prior art.
