 WHETHER TRIBUNAL WRONGLY DIRECTED ITSELF ON CONTACT 45 I agree with the submissions for the respondent that the Tribunal's reasons, including [61], do not demonstrate that it considered if any contact had been made between the applicant and his overseas near relatives, it was to be assumed that such contact was in the context of a social relationship and had occurred throughout the period in question.
 Rather, the passage in [61] indicates that the Tribunal considered that policy placed a requirement on a visa applicant to demonstrate (i.e. to satisfy the Tribunal) that there had not been contact of a social nature with his or her overseas near relatives throughout a reasonable period before the applicant made his or her visa application.
 WHETHER TRIBUNAL WRONGLY UNDERSTOOD THE ONUS OF PROOF 46 I also agree with the submissions of the respondent that the Tribunal's reference to the policy stating 'that the onus is on the visa applicant' is simply a reference to the policy's statement that 'it is for the applicant to demonstrate (or otherwise satisfy the decision-maker)' that he or she has not had social contact with an overseas near relative throughout the period in question.
