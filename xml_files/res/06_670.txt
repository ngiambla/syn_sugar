 The Scheme provides two alternative mechanisms for the holder of shares in SFE to receive consideration --- a share alternative and a cash and share alternative --- at the election of the holder. 3 The approach to an application such as this is well established by authority which I need not recite.
 The first question is whether there is any defect in either the Scheme itself or the procedure for approving it that would mean that the Scheme, if approved by members, would, or perhaps might, not be approved pursuant to s 411(6).
 The second question is whether the materials to be provided to members, particularly the Explanatory Statement defined in s 411(3) , comply with the requirements of that subsection and are in such a form as would enable a member to make an informed judgment as to whether to vote for or against the Scheme.
