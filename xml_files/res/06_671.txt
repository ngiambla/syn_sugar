 ON COSTS ORDER AGAINST LEGAL PRACTITIONER Introduction 1 When a legal practitioner, whether solicitor or counsel or both, fails in his or her duty to a client and the Court by serious incompetence in framing an application and claims for relief and in its presentation, the Court may order that the practitioner pay the costs of a party to the proceedings.
 That does not require demonstration of any collateral or improper purpose. 13 In Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 18 ; (2004) 133 FCR 582, Mansfield J rejected an application for costs made by the Minister against the solicitor for the applicant.
 A costs order may be made under s 43 of the Federal Court Act or O 62 r 9 when the solicitor or counsel has so failed in the duty to give proper consideration to the legal and/or factual questions involved in the preparation and presentation of an application as to be seriously derelict in his or her duty to the client and/or to the Court.
 They ought not have to be subjected to further unconscionability and inequity by the respondent. ' There is no basis for any suggestion that the shortcomings of the application and the way in which the proceedings were conducted has anything to do with the applicants themselves.
