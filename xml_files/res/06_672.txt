 He further claimed that because of his political activities he was attacked by political opponents who tried to kill him and left him with severe injuries. 3 The Tribunal found that the appellant was not a credible witness and that his evidence was vague, generalised and inconsistent, and further that documentary evidence provided by the appellant was not genuine.
 The Tribunal also found that the Freedom Party was largely inactive, and further that if the appellant resumed his membership of that party on his return, it would be 'most unlikely' that he would face any risk of persecution. 4 Before the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant claimed that the Tribunal acted in bad faith and/or was biased, had failed to investigate the appellant's claims, had denied the appellant natural justice and had made factual findings that were wrong.
 The appellant also claimed that the Tribunal's comments (in its decision) were not based upon reasoning which had a rational or logical foundation. 5 The Federal Magistrate found the appellant's claims could not be sustained because there was no evidence of bad faith or actual bias on the part of the Tribunal nor was there anything on the face of the decision which gave rise to an apprehension of bias.
