 It submits that the evidence, including the product information and product descriptions published by ACI Insulation, support this characterisation. 44 The respondent's written submissions, filed shortly before the hearing, contend that the products are white-faced foil laminates, not reflective foil insulation products, and that white-faced foil laminates are not goods of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use or consumption.
 The variations also include different surfaces, including single-faced foil, double-sided foil, double-sided foil with a non-glare finish applied to one side, and foil laminates that have special surfaces applied to them, such as a white polymer or similar decorative finish. (3) The attributes of white-faced foil laminates comprise washability, corrosion resistance, aesthetic appeal and suitability for use as an internal wall lining in commercial and industrial applications.
 All reflective foil laminates are and were suitable for bulk use, so this cannot be regarded as a distinguishing feature of white-faced foil laminates. (4) It is common for both uncoated reflective foil laminates and white-faced foil laminates to be left exposed to view in commercial and industrial buildings as the only form of roof or wall lining.
