 Introduction 1 On 29 March 2006 the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) applied to this Court for orders for the appointment of receivers to the property of four companies in the Westpoint Property and Finance Group and four individuals who were officers or former officers of companies in the Group.
 Similar orders were made in relation to Keypoint Developments on 26 May 2006 - Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 4) [2006] FCA 644. 3 Orders were also made requiring each of the defendants to prepare, and deliver to ASIC and the respective receivers, affidavits of their assets and liabilities. 4 ASIC sought orders that the costs of the receivers in each case should be met out of the assets of the defendants.
 I declined to make that order at the time and stood over the question whether the costs should be payable from the defendants' assets. 5 Each of the defendants has prepared and delivered affidavits of their assets and liabilities pursuant to the order which I made on 20 April 2006.
