 This and other elements of Ms Faulkner's affidavit are, in part, conclusionary in so far as they refer to a 'discovery' and locate it within the scope of Dr Chen's employment and within the course of her duties at the University.
 The purported assignment to CRI was of the right, title and interest to the invention entitled Controlled Release Preparation and all letters patents of the United States to be obtained on a pending application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty on 17 November 1994.
 The University also relies upon a letter from CRI's solicitor dated 12 April 2006 in which it is admitted that Dr Gray and Dr Chen were members of the Board of Management. 25 There were two letters exhibited to Ms Faulkner's affidavit from Davies Collison Cave Patent Attorneys dated 9 December 1994 and 11 December 1996.
