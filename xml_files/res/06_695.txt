 Mr Spencer acknowledged in evidence that he knew the terms of the Orders and that they had been made on 8 February 2006. 7 On 22 March 2006, Mr Spencer was served with a sealed copy of the Orders.
 Mr Small was able to open and print out the attachments to the 14 April email and the contents of the disk, but he was unable to open the attachments to the 6 April email.
 Notwithstanding its contention that there are deficiencies in the disclosure document provided by Mr Spencer, it does not press for an order that a further revised disclosure document be provided by Mr Spencer. 54 I am satisfied that there are difficulties with paragraph 12 of the Order.
