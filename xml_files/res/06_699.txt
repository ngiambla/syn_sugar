 There is no suggestion in the majority judgments that a court could exercise similar jurisdiction in civil proceedings or in committal proceedings; nor do they suggest that such a jurisdiction should be exercised in favour of an indigent person charged with a criminal offence which is other than serious. ' (Footnote omitted. ) 12 This reasoning of the joint judgment in Canellis has been applied in numerous cases. 13 In McGibbon v Linkenbagh (1996) 41 ALD 219 at 228 Kiefel J said: 'The principle established by Dietrich v R [1992] HCA 57 ; (1992) 109 ALR 385; 177 CLR 292 as to the use of a court's inherent powers to stay or adjourn proceedings until legal representation is obtained, where it concludes it is necessary for a fair trial, refers only to criminal proceedings: New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 124 ALR 513, 522; Williams v Official Trustee (1994) 122 ALR 585, 600 .
 It is not authority for the proposition that in other proceedings or inquiries such a step would be required by dictates of fairness, even where someone faced potentially serious consequences. ' 14 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leelee Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1121 , Mansfield J said (at [61]): 'The principle recognised in Dietrich ... is a feature of the entitlement to procedural fairness, but it is confined to serious criminal proceedings.
 That decision was not intended to apply in respect of civil proceedings: New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309 at 328-329 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ. ' 15 In Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1265 ; (2000) 101 FCR 20, Sackville, Marshall and Lehane JJ in a joint judgment said (at [22] --- [24]): 'The limited scope of the principle in Dietrich was recognised by the High Court in New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309.
 Cooper J rejected this submission, stating at [8]: 'Procedural fairness in a civil proceedings (sic) does not require that legal representation be provided to a party at trial: New South Wales v Canellis [1994] HCA 51 ; (1994) 181 CLR 309 at 330; Stuart v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 96 ATC 4960 (FC) at 4964. ' 21 In the circumstances of this case, where the procedure to be adopted in the contempt proceeding is civil rather than criminal, the respondent's application to stay the proceedings on the basis of Dietrich had to fail because the principle in Dietrich has no application to civil proceedings.
