 The first, second and third respondents filed an amended defence on 8 July 2005, expanding upon the previously filed defence and raising positive assertions not previously raised. 7 On 12 May 2005 the parties were ordered to give discovery before 11 July 2005 and provide each other with inspection of the discovered documents by 18 July 2005.
 His Honour also ordered the respondents to file and serve any expert's reports upon which the respondents intended to rely by 16 January 2006. 11 On 23 November 2005, French J varied the orders made on 8 November and directed the applicants to file their witness statements on or before 9 December 2005, and all respondents to file their witness statements on or before 16 January 2006. 12 That order was further varied by the consent of the parties to allow the applicants to file their witness statements by 23 December.
 The second and third respondents have been, at different times, outside the country, in the United States, and as a result they say they have had difficulty in instructing their former solicitors and now have difficulty in instructing their present solicitors.
