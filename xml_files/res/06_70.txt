 Secondly, and in any event the matter now should be adjourned because of the extensive amendments which have been allowed to the applicants' statement of claim. 4 These proceedings were commenced on 9 May 2005, initially against the first four respondents.
 The originating application was accompanied by the affidavit of Andrew John Gilmour, who has been retained by the applicants as their expert for the purpose of these proceedings and in particular the trial. 5 Mr Gilmour exhibited to his affidavit a report which had been provided to the first applicant.
 On 12 May 2005, upon undertakings given by the first, second and third respondents that they would not dispose of those properties, the application for interlocutory relief was dismissed. 6 The first, second and third respondents entered their appearance on 17 May 2005 and filed their first defence on 14 June 2005.
 An affidavit explaining non-compliance was filed on 20 September 2005. 8 As I have said, in response to the applicants' notice of motion issued on 2 September 2005, the fifth respondent was joined by order of French J on 27 September 2005.
 No further experts' reports have been provided by the applicants and the applicants' case still rests, at least in the evidential sense, upon Mr Gilmour's report of 1 November 2005. 10 On 8 November 2005 leave was given to the applicants to file yet a further amended statement of claim which was filed on the same day.
 On the same day, 8 November, French J ordered the applicants to file their witness statements on or before 22 November 2005; the fourth and fifth respondents to file their witness statements on or before 20 December 2005; and the first, second and third respondents to file their witness statements by 16 January 2006.
 His Honour also ordered the respondents to file and serve any expert's reports upon which the respondents intended to rely by 16 January 2006. 11 On 23 November 2005, French J varied the orders made on 8 November and directed the applicants to file their witness statements on or before 9 December 2005, and all respondents to file their witness statements on or before 16 January 2006. 12 That order was further varied by the consent of the parties to allow the applicants to file their witness statements by 23 December.
 On 9 December 2005 the Registry wrote to each of the parties advising that it was proposed that the matter be listed for hearing for a period of seven days, commencing on Monday, 13 March 2006, and seeking advice as to the availability of the legal advisers. 13 The applicants advised that they were available for trial on that date.
 Mr Tait, the solicitor for the fourth and fifth respondents asked that the matter start a week later because he would be overseas until 12 March 2006, and his absence from the country might interfere with the preparation of the fourth and fifth respondents' defence.
 The first, second and third respondents' solicitors indicated that their clients were intending to change solicitors and that they were having difficulty contacting their clients who were in the United States. 14 A directions hearing was held by French J on 16 December 2005, when the matters of which the Registry had been advised were brought to his Honour's attention.
