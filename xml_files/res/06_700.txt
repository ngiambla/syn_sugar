 As I noted in the principal reasons, the terms of that order effectively meant the order for imprisonment was suspended until 2036. 9 On 14 May 1999 the applicant sought a further order that the respondent be committed to prison or otherwise punished for contempt for a further breach of the order made by Jenkinson J on 10 March 1992.
 I found Mr Reid had involved himself in the management of the two corporations referred to in the statement of charge, namely, Battstone Australia Pty Ltd between about 3 March 2003 and 3 June 2003 and Australian Marble Pty Ltd between about 1 February 2003 and 14 July 2003. 16 The respondent was well aware that he was prohibited from managing a corporation.
 I think the better course is to simply take into account the previous sentence of imprisonment which was imposed by Kenny J which she allowed to remain suspended as a significant matter in the sentencing of Mr Reid, but to sentence him separately for his contempt. 25 There is no doubt that I have power to order imprisonment.
