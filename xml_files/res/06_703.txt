 It was not until 13 October 2005 that the applicant sought review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. 5 Before the Federal Magistrate the applicant claimed that he had not been prepared to attend the hearing in the Federal Court back on 4 August 2000 without the assistance of his migration agent, and that he was unable to find that person on the day.
 The Federal Magistrate found that there appeared to be no reasonable prospect of success of his application placed before the Court, and in those circumstances, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application as an abuse of process. 7 In support of the application for leave to appeal, the applicant filed an affidavit claiming, inter alia , that he had changed his address in July 2000 and had so informed the respondent Minister's department, yet documents were still sent by the department to his former address.
 The applicant also filed a draft notice of appeal claiming that the Tribunal failed to consider and properly exercise its discretionary power provided by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and that the Federal Magistrate had 'failed to consider the Tribunal decision [had] no basis for making such a statement'. 8 At the hearing of this application, the applicant sought merely to launch into an attack on the Tribunal's decision of 4 May 2000, asserting that the 'Green Book' had never been sent to him in the first place.
