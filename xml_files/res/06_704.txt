 The effect of those orders was to decline to set aside earlier orders of that Court which had dismissed an application for non-appearance pursuant to r 13.03A(c) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) as they stood in September 2005 ( NBBM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs Anor [2006] FMCA 51). 2 The reasons for judgment indicate that the learned Federal Magistrate firstly considered the applicant's explanation for the earlier non-appearance.
 That does not establish appealable error in the court below on this point. 3 The learned Federal Magistrate pointed out that if there had been a sufficient explanation it would also have been necessary to decide whether the applicant raised a serious question to be tried.
 No such basis was found in the Federal Magistrates Court. 4 Before me, the applicant refers in a roundabout way to noncompliance with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), which of course has been a very fashionable point to raise following certain authorities of the High Court and of this Court.
 He concedes those matters were not raised in the application to the Magistrates Court, and indeed has not been raised in any of the documents which have been filed in the application before this Court.
