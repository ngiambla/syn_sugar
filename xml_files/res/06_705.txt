 In that case, Moore J considered the question whether the Court should make an order finalising the class of group members and, in particular, whether the Court should be able to add or delete persons from the final list of group members in circumstances other than those resulting from some kind of slip or mistake.
 I adjourned the application for approval of the proposed settlement agreement to 7 April 2006 so as to allow notice of the settlement and notice of the application to the Court for its approval to be advertised in accordance with section 33X(4) of the FCA Act.
 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 11 The matters I raised on 31 March 2006 had been addressed fully, and in my view appropriately, by the time the matter came before me on 7 April 2006. 12 Pursuant to the orders I made on 31 March 2006, the applicant placed the required advertisements in The Age and The Herald Sun newspaper on 4 April 2006.
 In their opinions, the consolidated settlement agreement is fair, reasonable and appropriate and there are no reasons why the Court should not approve it. 20 For the forgoing reasons, and upon the undertaking of the solicitors for the applicant referred to above, I propose to approve the settlement of the proceeding on the terms contained in the consolidated settlement agreement dated 5 April 2006.
