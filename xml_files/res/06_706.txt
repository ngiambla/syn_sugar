 The appeal is from a decision of a delegate of the Commissioner of Patents made on 12 December 2002 whereby the delegate allowed part of the opposition and refused to order that the accepted patent application number 713629 proceed to grant.
 On 17 March 2006, a representative of the Commissioner of Patents appeared and informed the Court that the Commissioner of Patents did not oppose the orders sought by the appellant in the appeal, and did not wish to appear further in the proceedings. 6 There was no appearance on behalf of the Commissioner of Patents at the hearing on 16 May 2006.
 I consider that, before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent, the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent, if granted, would not be valid. ' 11 The appellant submitted that the appeal should be allowed and the patent application should proceed to grant essentially because the onus is on the now-withdrawn opponent to make out the opposition and, in this proceeding, the opponent has neither tendered nor adduced any evidence before this Court capable of discharging its onus.
