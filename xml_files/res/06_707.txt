 Rather it is a contravention that involves taking into account the fact that negotiations were conducted over a period in which cl 8A said they ought not to be conducted between Foxtel and Optus which culminated in the ultimate breach alleged, being the entry into the arrangement or agreements announced on 20 February 2002. 7 The 'Alchemy Paper' described by Sackville J at par 4 of his judgment in the passage there extracted records critically: 'Our legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against Optus is low -' 8 That was in the context of describing the fact that Optus had been negotiating with Foxtel in apparent breach of, inter alia, cl 8A.
 PARAGRAPH 6(C) 13 The claim is made that par 6(c) is still capable of being the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege because it is argued that it deals with a discrete subject matter that arises after cl 8A was entered into or the two variation agreements were made, and deals with a discrete subject matter as to consequences that might flow if Optus entered into an agreement with Foxtel after 18 February 2002. 14 In par 6(c) there is an examination of the possible consequences were the applicants to learn of a potential breach of cl 8A.
 The entry into and announcement of the arrangements between Optus and Foxtel parties on 20 February 2002 is alleged to have been a breach of cl 8A and to have been induced by Singtel, causing Optus to breach cl 8A. 15 The 'Alchemy Paper' refers to the legal advice about the risk of damages being awarded against Optus being low in the context of considering the entry into the agreement of 20 February, or what became or might become an agreement on 20 February.
 It is not, as I understand it, relevant to any allegation which the applicants have made in the proceedings, and I am of the opinion that the claim for privilege for that paragraph should be upheld. 24 The orders that I make are that the claim for privilege in respect of paragraphs 5 and the introductory words to pars 6, 6(c) and par 7 have not been established.
