 The amount they seek, they say, is less than half the cost which they have incurred. 3 The difficulty about the application for costs arises from s 85A of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act'), this being a proceeding under that Act. 4 In ordinary Federal Court proceedings, where there is a notice of discontinuance filed, in three of the four circumstances referred to in O 22 r 3 Federal Court Rules , being those set down in r2(1)(a), (b) and (c), in the absence of any specific order, the party discontinuing is to pay the costs of the party against whom the discontinued proceedings had been brought.
 Unreasonable conduct (2) Without limiting the Court's power to make orders under subsection (1), if the Federal Court is satisfied that a party to a proceeding has, by any unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to incur costs in connection with the institution or conduct of the proceeding, the Court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs. ' 6 The effect of s 85A was discussed by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia [1999] FCA 580 ; (1999) 93 FCR 305.
 The offer contained in the fax is a little bit at odds with the application for costs now made, the basis of it being that the deadline imposed by the facsimile, namely Wednesday 24 May 2006, passed and there was no Notice of Discontinuance filed, or any communication by Mr Coghill with Mr Neal. 9 In the light of all the material, including the written submissions filed by Mr Coghill today, and observations put to the Court on behalf of Queensland South Land Council by Mr Colin Hardy concerning attempts to resolve matters of dispute involving claims, including the claim of the Jagera People, I am not satisfied that this Notice of Motion is a proceeding which has by any unreasonable act or omission caused another party to incur costs in connection with the institution or conduct of it.
