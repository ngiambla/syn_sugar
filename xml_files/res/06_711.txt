 In this case, for example, the plaintiffs were not sure whether they could produce discovered documents to IMF and approached the court for the necessary permission. 5 The purpose for providing the documents to IMF is as follows.
 Under its agreement with the plaintiffs, IMF is required to pay the plaintiffs' costs and disbursements reasonably incurred in commencing and prosecuting the action and to pay any costs orders made against the plaintiffs.
 It is not, however, possible for IMF to properly review any case (or at least many cases, of which this is one) unless it has access to discovered documents.
