 1 This is an application made by former directors of Fairchild Development Pty Ltd (the company) and Elite Apartments Pty Limited which held over half of the ordinary shares in the company at the time it was joined as an applicant on the interlocutory process.
 A statement of affairs has been tendered and there has been evidence led from one of the directors, from the company's bookkeeper and from an external accountant or financial adviser which indicates that the company is solvent.
 I am disposed to follow it, including the grant of leave to the directors to bring the proceedings. 5 The practical result of this order is that the proceeding will be restored as a defended matter and then adjourned to a later date.
 I also take note of the undertakings to the Court given by counsel on behalf of two of the directors of the company to procure various payments to be made when St George Bank makes the funds available.
