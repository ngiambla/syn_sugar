 I cannot say any more about what might happen on an application to free enough money to enable the applicant to pursue her appeal to be paid to the trust account of the solicitor for the applicant. 3 However, it is relevant to that application, and also relevant to the basis for a stay, for me to say that, in my opinion, the appeal is arguable.
 There are provisions of the Act which relate to the interplay between it and the Proceeds of Crime Act (see for example s 58A of the Act) and, no doubt, on some occasion it will be necessary to closely examine how the two Acts interrelate.
 I think it is better that I say no more than I have said about that issue at the moment. 6 Under the circumstances, as the order under the Proceeds of Crime Act is in force, I therefore propose to grant a stay of proceedings under the sequestration order until the disposition of the appeal or earlier order on certain terms which have been discussed between the parties.
