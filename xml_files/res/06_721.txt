 LOCATION OF DOCUMENTS 19 The respondents contend that the documents put in issue by the pleadings are largely located in Mackay, Queensland. 20 JLV submits that the location of documents is not critical because it is usual in the course of prior preparation for either party to work from copies.
 It is against that perspective that the application to change venue must be viewed. 31 The factors arguably supporting transfer are the present likelihood of more witnesses and documents being located in Mackay than Perth; and the disparity in resources of the parties.
 The factors arguably against transfer are that nevertheless a significant number of witnesses and documents will be located in Perth; Mr MacDonald has submitted to jurisdiction in Western Australia; and video links from Mackay to Perth may be as convenient to the respondents as video links from Townsville to Perth.
