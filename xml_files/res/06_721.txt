 In submissions at the hearing, counsel for JLV stated that in the event the respondents are prepared to go on oath and explain the time sheets placed in evidence in the affidavit of Mr Forgie, said to support this claim, and if the explanation is satisfactory, it will not be pursued by JLV.
 The evidence of Mr Forgie was that the solicitor for JLV anticipates that it will call evidence from himself, Mr Johnson, a Mr Thomas and a Mr Sealey at the hearing of the application; that is, four witnesses in total.
 However, JLV distinguishes the present circumstances on the basis that the respondents and their solicitors are located in Mackay, which is itself remote from the nearest office of the Queensland Registry in Townsville: see Mr Arthur's earlier affidavit at [11].
 It is against that perspective that the application to change venue must be viewed. 31 The factors arguably supporting transfer are the present likelihood of more witnesses and documents being located in Mackay than Perth; and the disparity in resources of the parties.
