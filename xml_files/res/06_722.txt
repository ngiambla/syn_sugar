 Relief sought 22 For the reasons given above I am satisfied that the necessary elements of each cause of action pleaded by the applicants have been made out and that it is appropriate that judgment be entered against the respondent pursuant to O 35A r3(2)(d).
 Ms Dani Muntz states that as recently as 21 May 2006 she observed the respondent at the Caribbean Gardens Market selling items bearing the Bob the Builder Marks and the Thomas Marks and two jackets purchased at that time were exhibited to her affidavit. 24 The applicants also seek an order that the respondent deliver up the counterfeit goods to them.
 I am therefore satisfied that it is appropriate to make the order sought. 25 The applicants also seek an order that the respondent pay damages to be determined by the Court but would like some time to consider if they wish to pursue such damages.
