 His Honour noted, correctly, that the tribunal had assessed the claims and evidence which the appellant had put forward and was not obliged to conduct a further investigation into the matter, referring to Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at 21-22 [43] .
 The tribunal gave no explanation for discounting what appeared to be newspaper articles before it in which there could have been no doubt that, if genuine, the Jirga did know of the appellant's group's existence and what is more it had sought to banish him and cause his family to account to the Jirga by reason of the appellant's and his group's activities. 57 The tribunal gave no reasons for asserting any form of implausibility of that material.
 The tribunal committed a jurisdictional error in dealing with the claims of the appellant. 69 And, in reaching its conclusion that the appellant could relocate to Karachi where he could live safely, the tribunal, first, considered in a jurisdictionally erroneous manner only his claim relating to the tribal and religious leaders of Khyber Agency and, secondly, said it had taken into account all of the evidence.
