 Clause 5 of the agreement provided that, if any of these instalments were not paid, the applicants might re-list these proceedings and apply for summary judgment on "the claim for pecuniary relief for so much of the settlement amount ... that is outstanding at the date the proceedings are re-listed " .
 They also sought delivery up pursuant to the undertakings given to the Court on 27 January 2006. 3 In an affidavit of 1 June 2006, Emma Cashen, also the applicants' solicitor, affirmed that, at the time of making her affidavit, the applicants had still not received the third instalment of settlement monies or any other settlement payment.
 Ms Cashen also stated that her firm had served a copy of the notice of motion and Mr Jordan's affidavit of 18 April 2006 on the respondents by sending them to the respondents' solicitors and had informed the respondents' solicitors that the motion was to be heard on 2 June 2006. 4 The respondents did not appear at the hearing on 2 June 2006.
 This is so notwithstanding that I would reject the respondents' primary argument that the deed of settlement alone was sufficient to justify an order for summary judgment pursuant to O 20 r 1 of the Rules. 18 The applicants' evidence that the respondents have failed to comply with their undertakings is uncontradicted.
