 By its application and statement of claim, Nokia alleges that the respondents have, without its licence or authority, manufactured or caused to be manufactured, imported or caused to be imported, advertised, offered for sale, distributed, supplied and sold goods bearing one or more of the Nokia Trade Marks.
 Also, on 5 February 2005, she said she attended the premises of the fourth respondent where she purchased a Nokia branded mobile phone battery and a neck strap. 19 In his affidavits of 16 March 2006 and 28 April 2006 Mr Taylor stated that he had gained considerable experience in identifying counterfeit Nokia products.
 Counsel submitted that, bearing in mind this evidence and the fourth respondent's admissions, summary judgment is appropriate. 37 In written submissions, Nokia contended that the material filed on behalf of the first and second respondents (Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd and Mr Zeitoun respectively) falls short of establishing an arguable defence.
