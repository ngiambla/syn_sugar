 On 8 January 1999, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant informing him that it was not prepared to make a favourable decision on the material it had, and invited him to attend a hearing.
 The first was that there had been no valid application for a protection visa, and the Tribunal had no power or authority to make the decision it did.
 In an appeal from the exercise of such a power, it is necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that there was some error of principle or some fundamental misapprehension of the facts when the discretionary power was exercised.
