 By paragraph 3 of the Notice of Motion the Applicant seeks an order that the Respondent make further and better discovery of all email correspondence containing: (a) any comparison between the Applicant's 4-in-1 bucket and any other 4-in-1 bucket; (b) any comment on the Applicant's 4-in-1 bucket, by 4.00pm, 16 June 2006. 2 In support of the application for that order, the Applicant relies upon the affidavit of Justin James Twigg sworn 7 June which annexes an email dated 1 December 2003 from Mr Alan Wade who was at that date an employee of the Respondent to Mr Alan Wade at an email address alan@digga.com .
 Since it is not disputed by the Respondent that in formulating the expression of the Respondent's idea for a 4-in-1 bucket by the development of plans for the manufacture of such a bucket, the Respondent had "access" to the Applicant's bucket and had "regard" to the features evident in the Applicant's bucket, emails which go to establishing that access and that regard are not relevant because, to that extent, that matter is not in controversy between the parties. 5 However, the question is not simply one of objective similarity.
 In Clarendon v Henley Arch (2000) 46 IPR 309 at page 316 at paragraph 28, their Honours Heerey, Sundberg and Finkelstein JJ observed. '[28] Further, in a case where there has been deliberate copying, the Court will not look kindly on a defendant when the plaintiff seeks to establish that what has been copied is sufficiently objectively similar to the plaintiff's work.
 It is a sound principle of copyright law that the court should not allow one man to take away the result 'of another man's labour, or, in other words, his property', unless it is satisfied that the part taken is 'so slight, and the affect upon the total composition was so small', 'as to render the taking perfectly immaterial', or what is much the same thing, that the part taken is an unsubstantial part [citations omitted].
