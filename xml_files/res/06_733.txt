 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal ought to have proceeded on the basis that, because he was recognised as a refugee when he came to Australia, Australia owes protection obligations in respect of him unless those obligations have ceased because of Art 1C(5) of the Convention.
 It may be the case (I express no view one way or the other) that specific information given to the Tribunal by a witness at the request of an applicant would be information given by the applicant for the purpose of the application.
