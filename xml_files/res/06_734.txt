 In the Commissioner's analysis with respect to whether an ABC entity could be 'an arranger' for the purposes of par (e), the Commissioner refers to 'ABC issu(ing) shares to the trustee of a trust' and 'ABC intends to issue shares to the trustee for the benefit of the RMCs employees', when the entity actually issuing the shares was ABC Public.
 As explained by par [1] of TR 1999/5, the Ruling considers, inter alia , whether a payment by an employer of money (which does not constitute salary or wages or an exempt benefit) to the trustee of a trust or non-complying superannuation fund is a fringe benefit, and the value of that benefit.
 It is not necessary for me to further consider the point for, in my view, the payment by Essenbourne to the trustee does not qualify as a fringe benefit as it is defined. ' 44 Accordingly, on the facts of the case, Kiefel J held that the benefits provided were not 'fringe benefits'.
