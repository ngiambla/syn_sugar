 Ms Pelka paid the rates. 51 The matters set out in s 4(3)(a) are not exhaustive of the financial aspects of a relationship which can be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether it is 'marriage-like'.
 That is to say: (i) There was no question of any joint responsibility for providing care or support of children. (ii) The living arrangements involved separate bedrooms and a common kitchen, lounge and bathroom.
 But the Tribunal's conclusion about the importance of the relationship, the closeness of Ms Pelka's bond to Mr Kuhl and its emotional significance to her, could as well fit such a relationship.
