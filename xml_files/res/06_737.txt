 That raises an objective test and does not, logically, require consideration of the Commission's actual consideration. 13 It is not clear, nor is there any detail in the pleading, what is contemplated by the duty to accord procedural fairness and natural justice in giving to Telstra the statutory written notice beyond an obligation to comply with s 151AKA(10)(a).
 The inference that there must have been other material is drawn from the differences between the consultation notice and the competition notice. 14 Section 151AP provides that when deciding whether to issue a competition notice, the Commission must have regard to ' such other matters as the Commission considers relevant ' and that the Commission does not need to notify the carrier or carriage service provider of those matters. 15 Telstra is either correct about an entitlement to such other information or it is not but the information itself is not relevant to that entitlement; in either case discovery of the information itself is not necessary.
 It alleges that the competition notice is defective in its content and that it deviates in significant respects from the consultation notice. 17 That latter allegation and other alleged deficiencies in the competition notice can be tested by construction of the notices, a comparison between the two notices and a consideration of whether the competition notice complies with the statutory requirements as to content.
 The Commission has not provided reasons for the decision to issue the competition notice and that is a relevant consideration ( Australian Securities Commission v Somerville (1994) 51 FCR 38 at 49) but does not, of itself, support an inference that the Commission failed to consider Telstra's submissions.
