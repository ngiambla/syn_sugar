 That motion came on for hearing before French J and, on 23 December 2003, his Honour made an order that the application be struck out and that the applicants pay the respondent's costs of the proceedings: Engler v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (No 3) (2003) 54 ATR 617.
 French J noted that Ms Engler and Mr Gates had had great difficulty in formulating a viable statement of claim, despite the fact that they had had assistance from three different legal practitioners, two of whom acted on a pro bono basis.
