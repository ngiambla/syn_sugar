 Lee J also made an order that the matter was to be listed for hearing for two days on dates after 10 May 2006. 3 Mr Gates filed an amended statement of claim on 15 February 2006. 4 On 23 March 2006 Mr Gates filed an affidavit and on 4 April 2006 he filed a second affidavit containing minor corrections to his first affidavit. 5 Mr Gates has appeared in person in the proceedings and he has given details of a residential address, telephone number and a facsimile number. 6 On 5 May 2006 an officer in the Registry of the Court advised Mr Gates that it was proposed to list the proceedings for hearing for one-and-a-half days commencing on 12 June 2006.
 That motion came on for hearing before French J and, on 23 December 2003, his Honour made an order that the application be struck out and that the applicants pay the respondent's costs of the proceedings: Engler v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (No 3) (2003) 54 ATR 617.
 French J noted that Ms Engler and Mr Gates had had great difficulty in formulating a viable statement of claim, despite the fact that they had had assistance from three different legal practitioners, two of whom acted on a pro bono basis.
