 The Tribunal (i) accepted that the applicant developed an interest in Christianity in about 1997 and occasionally attended an official Christian church in Wuhan until she secured employment in Henan; and (ii) was satisfied that she became involved with Christians in Henan and met with a small group there twice weekly to engage in prayer, singing and reading the Bible.
 Nonetheless, the Tribunal did not accept that she (a) was a member of any particular underground church in China; (b) was detained, assaulted or harmed in any way by the Chinese authorities for any Convention reason; (c) was forced into hiding for a Convention reason; or (d) was or is of any adverse interest to the Chinese authorities.
 In her additional statement provided to the Tribunal on 8 August 2005 and marked B, the Applicant stated 'at the hearing I was asked about the numbers in my underground church group, but I did not go into as much detail as I could because I did not realise why it was important.
 I am not satisfied that the Applicant's group met with any other Christian groups, given the Applicant's evidence before the Tribunal that she was not aware of any other groups and later on claimed in writing to the Tribunal that she did not understand the Tribunal's questions, stating they met on special occasions and it was her Senior's responsibility to make contact with other groups and even overseas visitors.
