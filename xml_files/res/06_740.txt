 Under that section it is unlawful for an employer, such as Maxim (Vic), to pay wages to an employee for a period during which the employee engages in industrial action. 4 As I said in a previous judgment in this proceeding concerning the second respondent in Furlong v Maxim Electrical Services (Aust) Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1518 at [1] : "There is a real issue in this proceeding whether the relevant employees did engage in industrial action.
 That is yet to be determined. " 5 Adapting what follows at [1] in the previous judgment to the current circumstances: "All I am currently required to do is to assess the appropriate penalty, if any, to be imposed on [Maxim (Vic)] , on the basis of the agreed statement of facts advanced by it and the applicant, Mr Furlong. " 6 Maxim (Vic) admits that it made payments to certain of its employees at a time when those employees were engaged in industrial action on 5 and 6 August 2003.
 I will impose the penalty for breach of the Act but not impose any additional penalty for breach of the certified agreement, in respect of which a declaration will be recorded. 12 For the sake of completeness, as I did in the previous judgment, I reiterate that in accepting that Maxim (Vic) breached the agreement I am not expressing any view about the conduct of the third respondent, the Union or any respondent other that Maxim (Vic). 13 At the directions hearing at which this aspect of the proceeding was programmed, counsel for the third to sixth respondents formally submitted that judgment against Maxim (Vic) should not be given at this stage.
