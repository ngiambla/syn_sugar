 THE APPLICANT'S MOTION FOR A SPLIT TRIAL AND OTHER THINGS Submissions on the split trial application 25 MWO applied to have the quantification of any loss or damage suffered by MWO as alleged under paragraph 41 of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim ("SFASC") determined subsequently and separately to all other matters in the proceeding.
 MWO also sought to be relieved of the obligation to file, prior to trial, evidence going to the quantification of this loss. 26 In support of its application for a split trial, MWO relied on affidavits of Nicholas John Andersen sworn on 9 May 2006, 24 May 2006 and 8 June 2006, together with exhibits.
 Telstra characterised McClusky's statements as "vague and unparticularised", noting that he did "not propose or identify a methodology and merely assumes a need for investigation of all Connections and Trailing Commissions". 35 Telstra contended that, in the circumstances of the case, it would not be possible for the parties or the Court to know what evidence goes "solely to the quantification" of loss, as opposed to going to liability, breach, or the existence of any loss.
