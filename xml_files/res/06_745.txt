 On my reading, Nicholson J was treating the application for interim relief as a step in the proceeding, as he went on to say at 214-215 [8] that: 'the proceeding was instituted with reasonable cause and [was] one which remained, in the applicant's mind, reasonable throughout, until it learnt eventually of the certification of the agreement. ' This simply amounts to a finding that, on the facts, costs should not be ordered under the proviso to s 347(1) because the interlocutory application was not instituted 'vexatiously or without reasonable cause'.
 In fact, in Fenech , Ryan JR referred to an earlier order made by Marshall J in the proceedings, to the effect that the respondent should pay costs pursuant to s 170EHA as a result of the dismissal of its application for an interlocutory injunction. 19 For the foregoing reasons, I consider that s 824(1) and (2) are capable of applying to the respondents' interlocutory motion seeking the discharge or stay of my earlier orders.
