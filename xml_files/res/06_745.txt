 INTRODUCTION 1 On 26 May 2006, I dismissed a notice of motion dated 25 May 2006 by which the respondents sought orders discharging or staying an interlocutory injunction which I granted in these proceedings on 19 May 2006: Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 2) [2006] FCA 652.
 This submission was said to be supported by an illustrative example given in the Explanatory Memorandum. 9 In my opinion, these submissions do not accord with the authorities. 10 In Shackley v Australian Croatian Club Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 736 (' Shackley' ), a decision of the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Wilcox CJ held that the expression 'proceeding in a matter' in s 347(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth) included a subsidiary application made in the course of the principal action: at 744.
 On my reading, Nicholson J was treating the application for interim relief as a step in the proceeding, as he went on to say at 214-215 [8] that: 'the proceeding was instituted with reasonable cause and [was] one which remained, in the applicant's mind, reasonable throughout, until it learnt eventually of the certification of the agreement. ' This simply amounts to a finding that, on the facts, costs should not be ordered under the proviso to s 347(1) because the interlocutory application was not instituted 'vexatiously or without reasonable cause'.
 In fact, in Fenech , Ryan JR referred to an earlier order made by Marshall J in the proceedings, to the effect that the respondent should pay costs pursuant to s 170EHA as a result of the dismissal of its application for an interlocutory injunction. 19 For the foregoing reasons, I consider that s 824(1) and (2) are capable of applying to the respondents' interlocutory motion seeking the discharge or stay of my earlier orders.
