 Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) 6 Section 120(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) provides: "A person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. " 7 "Sign" is defined in s 6 to include a letter, word, name, device etc.
 The vocabulary of the English language is common property: it belongs alike to all; and no one ought to be permitted to prevent the other members of the community from using for the purposes of description a word which has reference to the character or quality of goods. " In my view, the characters in question are simply descriptive of the service the respondent provides, that is to say a professional driving school in Melbourne.
