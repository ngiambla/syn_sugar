 I gave directions to facilitate the making of such an application. 2 On 19 May 2006, the respondents filed a notice of motion seeking costs on an indemnity basis or, alternatively, on a solicitor/client basis.
 They also sought an order that the applicant pay their costs thrown away (by reason of certain amendments made to the applicant's statement of claim) on an indemnity basis, or alternatively, on a solicitor/client basis.
 THE RESPONDENTS' CASE FOR COSTS ON A HIGHER SCALE 3 There are three separate bases upon which the respondents contend that they are entitled to costs on a higher scale. 4 In support of the first of these contentions, namely that arising out of the conduct of the litigation, Mr Fitzgerald, on behalf of the respondents, argued that this proceeding had been unduly lengthened and rendered unnecessarily complex.
 He submitted that it was an oppressive imposition upon the respondents to endure these repeated pleadings, and to meet the "shifting and amorphous case" that the applicant had presented. 5 Mr Fitzgerald also relied upon the applicant's failure to discover a highly relevant document, namely the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission letter of 8 January 2002, referred to in my primary reasons for judgment. 6 Finally, he submitted that the applicant had made serious and unwarranted allegations against the respondents and their former officers, all of which had failed at trial.
