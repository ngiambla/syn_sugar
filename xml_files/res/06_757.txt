 I reject the respondents' principal contention that the plant breeder's rights allegations are not pleaded generally in a way that discloses the material facts. 16 There is, however, an aspect of the plant breeder's rights claims that is, in my view, deficiently pleaded.
 The Amended Statement of Claim alleges a contravention of plant breeder's rights in respect of three different plant varieties: paragraphs 34 to 38 relate to the Rich Lady peach; paragraphs 41 to 45 relate to the Arctic Star nectarine; and paragraphs 48 to 52 relate to the Earliqueen plum.
