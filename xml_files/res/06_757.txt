 I reject the respondents' principal contention that the plant breeder's rights allegations are not pleaded generally in a way that discloses the material facts. 16 There is, however, an aspect of the plant breeder's rights claims that is, in my view, deficiently pleaded.
 The Amended Statement of Claim alleges a contravention of plant breeder's rights in respect of three different plant varieties: paragraphs 34 to 38 relate to the Rich Lady peach; paragraphs 41 to 45 relate to the Arctic Star nectarine; and paragraphs 48 to 52 relate to the Earliqueen plum.
 The respondents argued that some illogicality or inconsistency arose because paragraphs 4, 5 and 8 of the Amended Statement of Claim allege that each of Fred, Bruno and Tony are and were at all relevant times in effective control of fourth and fifth respondents.
 Be that as it may, Mr Caine indicated that if pleading requires some attention, it would be appropriate to address this matter by adding some words to paragraphs 4(f), 5(e) and 8(e) of the Amended Statement of Claim, to the effect that the relevant individual was in effective control 'either alone or in conjunction with his brothers'.
