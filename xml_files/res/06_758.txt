 1 This is an application by the first respondent, Hood Group Holdings Pty Ltd ('Hood'), for an order under s 1337H of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Corporations Act ') that the proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
 In addition, SETL and SEPL claim interest and costs. 5 The basis of the claims is outlined in the statement of claim and the following is taken from that document. 6 SETL is a public company limited by shares and it was admitted to the official list of the Australian Stock Exchange on 21 May 2002.
 At all material times, it has operated a business which undertakes research, development, manufacture and distribution of braking systems. 7 SEPL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SETL. 8 Hood is a public company which was incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the Corporations Act on 9 August 2001. 9 Kieronska was a director of SETL between 2001 and 2005 and was involved in the daily management of its business.
 Hood was to receive a fee of 8 per cent of the underwritten amount of $5,030,959, to be satisfied by the issue of shares and related options in SETL, a management fee of $125,000, and all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the underwritten amount. 12 On 27 February 2003, SETL issued a prospectus for a pro rata non-renounceable rights issue to its existing shareholders on a 1 for 2.79 basis, to raise $5,030,959 by the issue of 33,539,728 new shares at 15c per share and one free new option for each new share subscribed.
 On 1 April 2003, the offer under the prospectus closed and on 4 April 2003, the new shares and options were due to be allotted under the prospectus. 13 On 7 April 2003, SETL issued a shortfall certificate to Hood, pursuant to clause 5 of the underwriting agreement, certifying that 820,697 shares and related options had been applied for under the prospectus and the shortfall consisted of 32,719,031 shares and related options. 14 On 24 April 2003, and pursuant to the underwriting agreement, Hood lodged an application with SETL for the shortfall and agreed to pay the shortfall on 2 May 2003.
 By 5 May 2003, SETL had only received $437,000 in respect of the shortfall from Hood. 15 On or about 5 May 2003, Kieronska and/or Morley caused SETL to agree with Hood that SETL would issue 28,569,031 fully paid ordinary shares, 28,569,031 options in SETL to Hood, and Hood would treat these securities as restricted securities, as defined in the Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rules, and would not transfer, encumber or otherwise deal with any of the securities until all application moneys for the securities were delivered to SETL.
 On that date, Hood, a Mr Stanley Holmes, a principal of Hood, and 3D Capital Pty Ltd, executed an agreement which provided that the outstanding amount from Hood to SETL was approximately $3,693,545.40 and at SETL's request Hood would immediately grant a first ranking charge to SETL over all of its assets and undertaking to secure the outstanding amount, and at SETL's request Mr Holmes would immediately grant a first ranking charge to SETL over any assets he owned or controlled to secure the payment of the outstanding amount, including certain specified assets.
 They allege that, by causing SETL to make the agreement for the issue of the securities and by causing SETL to issue the securities in circumstances in which Hood had not fully paid for the securities and its obligation to make such a payment was unsecured, Kiernska and Morley each breached the duties they owed to SETL to the knowledge, and with the involvement of, Hood. 18 SETL and SEPL also make claims against Kieronska and Morley for breach of the duties they owed to SETL and SEPL in that they caused expenses to be paid that were not for the benefit of either SETL or SEPL.
 It is asserted that the business operations of Hood are conducted in New South Wales, that documents relevant to the dispute are located in New South Wales, that the dispute has been conducted through Hood's solicitors in New South Wales, and that the majority of witnesses reside in New South Wales.
 SETL and SEPL operate out of premises in Balcatta in Perth. 23 Mr Johnsen states that he has been informed by his solicitors that if the proceedings against Hood are transferred to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, representatives of SETL and SEPL will need to attend conferences with solicitors and counsel in Sydney on a number of occasions and will need to attend any trial proceedings in New South Wales.
 Clearly, the claims by SETL and SEPL against Kieronska and Morley are not. 30 The alternative claim by SETL and SEPL against Hood and their claims against Kieronska and Morley are proceedings with respect to civil matters arising under the Corporations legislation within the terms of s 1337H(1) of the Corporations Act . 31 The exclusive jurisdiction clause is a matter in favour of an order transferring the proceedings.
