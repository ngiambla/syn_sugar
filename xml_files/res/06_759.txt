 Little was said about that matter in the submissions before me and I will proceed on the basis that, for the purposes of this application, the plaintiff's claim is for US$233,500. 13 It seems to be common ground that, initially at least, it was a term of the repair contract that the work would be performed within a period of 22 days. 14 At the forefront of the defendant's case is an allegation that there was a liquidated damages clause in the contract between it and the plaintiff and that that clause applied if there was delay by the plaintiff in the performance of the repair work.
 The plaintiff did not pause on these questions because, it submits, the evidence is to the effect that its claim is likely to succeed, and that even if the defendant's set-off and counterclaim is also successful, there will still be a balance of judgment in its favour.
