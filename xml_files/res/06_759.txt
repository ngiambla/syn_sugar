 It was released on 4 August 2004 upon the sum of US$350,000 being paid into court. 4 There is no challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court. 5 On 20 January 2005 the defendant issued a notice of motion wherein it sought an order that the plaintiff pay into court the sum of $75,000 as security for the costs of the defendant incurred or likely to be incurred in defending the action, and an order that the defendant be at liberty to apply for further security, if appropriate.
 Little was said about that matter in the submissions before me and I will proceed on the basis that, for the purposes of this application, the plaintiff's claim is for US$233,500. 13 It seems to be common ground that, initially at least, it was a term of the repair contract that the work would be performed within a period of 22 days. 14 At the forefront of the defendant's case is an allegation that there was a liquidated damages clause in the contract between it and the plaintiff and that that clause applied if there was delay by the plaintiff in the performance of the repair work.
 The defendant asserts that, notwithstanding the removal of certain work from the scope of the contract, the plaintiff still took over 22 days to complete work on the ship, and that it has a claim under the liquidated damages clause, which it quantifies at US$184,800. 15 It is not entirely clear from the defence and counterclaim whether the defendant says the period for performance was renegotiated, or in what other way the defendant can found a claim in relation to what it says was a variation to the period for performance.
 The plaintiff did not pause on these questions because, it submits, the evidence is to the effect that its claim is likely to succeed, and that even if the defendant's set-off and counterclaim is also successful, there will still be a balance of judgment in its favour.
