 That was the tenure of the Lombadina/Djarindjin area when the native title determination application was lodged on 1 September 1995. 7 The land was subsequently divided into smaller locations and reserves vested as follows: Current Tenure Current Purpose Owner/Vestee Dampier Location 404 Freehold The Roman Catholic Bishop of Broome Dampier Location 405 Freehold The Roman Catholic Bishop of Broome Reserve 46574 Cemetery The Aboriginal Lands Trust Reserve 46575 Power House The Aboriginal Lands Trust Reserve 46576 Use and Benefit of Aboriginal Inhabitants The Aboriginal Lands Trust Lot 431 on DP 214744 --- Dedicated 14/12/2001 Dedicated Road 8 At the time the native title determination application was lodged on 1 September 1995 the Kooljaman area comprised the following: 'a. portion of Dampier Location 19, Certificate of Title no 1744/116 under the Transfer of Land Act 1893 as amended, originally granted on 20 October 1986 to the Aboriginal Development Commission of Bonner House, Woden, Australian Capital Territory as registered proprietor of an estate in fee simple, and transferred on 22 March 1991 to the Kooljaman Land Aboriginal Corporation ... of Cape Leveque; b.
 Lot 69 on deposited plan 170766, Certificate of Title no 1744/117 under the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (WA), originally granted on 4 April 1967 to the Commonwealth of Australia under Certificate of Title 1316/217 as registered proprietor of an estate in fee simple, and transferred on 22 March 1991 to the Kooljaman Land Aboriginal Corporation ... of Cape Leveque. ' 9 There are no trusts of the Kooljaman area disclosed on these certificates of title.
 The 1998 amendment went no further than to except AMSA freehold land from the class of Crown to Crown grants so that it fell within the general exclusion of freehold titles and thus outside the claim area. 26 There is, in my opinion, no room for debate that the application as originally filed and as it stood after the 1998 amendments did not extend to freehold lands save for that subject to grants to the Crown or Crown authorities.
 The adjourned areas were the subject of freehold titles vested in the Roman Catholic Bishop of Broome and the Kooljaman Land Aboriginal Corporation respectively. 27 The applicants submitted that the application, as reamended in 1999, repeated the AMSA exclusion '... and makes clear otherwise that sections 47 , 47A and 47B of the Native Title Act, 1993 will be relied upon in relation to freeholds that are not so excluded. ' So, it was submitted, the adjourned area was covered by the application. 28 The 1999 amendments excluded from the claim area '[a]n unqualified grant of an estate in fee simple'.
