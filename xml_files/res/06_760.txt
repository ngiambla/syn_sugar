 Lot 69 on deposited plan 170766, Certificate of Title no 1744/117 under the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (WA), originally granted on 4 April 1967 to the Commonwealth of Australia under Certificate of Title 1316/217 as registered proprietor of an estate in fee simple, and transferred on 22 March 1991 to the Kooljaman Land Aboriginal Corporation ... of Cape Leveque. ' 9 There are no trusts of the Kooljaman area disclosed on these certificates of title.
 The 1998 amendment went no further than to except AMSA freehold land from the class of Crown to Crown grants so that it fell within the general exclusion of freehold titles and thus outside the claim area. 26 There is, in my opinion, no room for debate that the application as originally filed and as it stood after the 1998 amendments did not extend to freehold lands save for that subject to grants to the Crown or Crown authorities.
