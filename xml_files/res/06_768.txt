 The Tribunal decision 7 The Tribunal found that there could be no dispute that the applicant did not pass the character test by reason of his substantial criminal record: s 501(6)(a).
 Under s 499(2A) , the Tribunal was bound to comply with that Direction, which provided guidance to decision-makers on the application of the character test including the considerations to be taken into account in exercising the discretion when the person does not pass the character test.
 The Direction set out three primary considerations to which regard must be had, although the decision-maker was also required to adopt a balancing approach which took into account all relevant considerations.
 Ultimately, it found that whilst it was not in the best interests of the child to affirm the decision, and that certain other considerations also weighed against that course, those were outweighed by considerations of community protection and expectations.
