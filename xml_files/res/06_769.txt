 1 This is an appeal by the plaintiffs pursuant to s 1321 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) against a decision of the defendants' liquidator rejecting a formal proof of debt or claim.
 The plaintiffs seek an order reversing that decision, and an order requiring the liquidator to allow the proof of debt for such sum as may be awarded against the defendants to the first plaintiff in a proceeding commenced in the Supreme Court of Victoria (2090 of 2001).
 That proceeding was subsequently transferred to this Court (VID 909 of 2002), and will be referred to as "the principal proceeding". 2 The first to eighth plaintiffs are all companies associated with Mr Leo Blake, the ninth plaintiff.
