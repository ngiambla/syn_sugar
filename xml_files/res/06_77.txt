 It was that proceeding, MLG 587 of 2004, that was dismissed by McInnis FM on 24 January 2005. 9 On 16 February 2005, the applicant lodged an application in the Migration Review Tribunal (the "Tribunal") for review of the delegate's decision.
 On 24 February 2005, the Tribunal declined to accept or consider the application for review, on the basis that it was not lodged within the prescribed time limit. 10 On 18 March 2005, the applicant filed in this Court a Form 56A application under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), seeking orders "to quash the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court" (presumably the decision of McInnis FM on 24 January 2005 in Tran (No 2) ) and to remit the matter to the Tribunal for reconsideration according to law.
