 He further contended that, to the extent to which documents were brought into existence for the purposes of, or in furtherance of, those activities, public policy would remove the shield of legal professional privilege from those documents. 30 In some cases, it is clear that documents over which privilege is claimed were brought into existence in circumstances where public policy removes the shield of privilege.
 Mr Nicol points to the fact that TP's engagement to address the enforceability of the charges commenced some weeks before 31 August 2005. 81 Mr Caldicott was billed by TP in the period June, July and August 2005 for quite substantial work on behalf of the Sobey interests in identifying assets of the Scheme companies and drawing the security documentation.
 I will declare that those documents, produced by Mr Tanti, should not be available for inspection by Mr Nicol. 109 Given the complexity of the task of identifying and ruling on the claims for privilege, I will give Mr Nicol liberty to apply for a determination to vary any of the determinations that I have made that particular documents are privileged from production on one or other of the grounds he has relied upon.
