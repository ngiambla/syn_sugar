 As mentioned above, the criterion which the Tribunal found that Mrs Baccon satisfied was that she had '10 years qualifying Australian residence' (s 43(1)(a)). 13 Section 7(5) of the Act provides: 'A person has 10 years qualifying Australian residence if and only if: (a) the person has, at any time, been an Australian resident for a continuous period of not less than 10 years; or (b) the person has been an Australian resident during more than one period and: (i) at least one of those periods is 5 years or more; and (ii) the aggregate of those periods exceeds 10 years. ' (emphasis in original) 14 Section 7(3) of the Act recognises that an element of judgment is involved in determining whether or not a person is residing in Australia.
 Nature and extent of Mrs Baccon's employment, business or financial ties with Australia 30 The Tribunal noted that there was no evidence that Mrs Baccon was employed in Australia or retained any business ties with Australia although it considered the absence of employment or business ties to be not unusual for a person of retirement age.
 The Tribunal also observed that details of Mrs Baccon's financial ties with Australia were sparse. 31 Again, the Tribunal's reasons for decision do not suggest that it gave consideration to the nature and extent of Mrs Baccon's employment, business and financial ties with Australia since 1988 for the purpose of determining whether she had 10 years qualifying Australian residence.
