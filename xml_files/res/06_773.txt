 The Tribunal made no finding that her daughter had lived in Australia throughout the period that it found that Mrs Baccon had been an Australian resident. 27 The Tribunal's reasons for decision do not suggest that it gave consideration to the relevance of the limited nature and extent of Mrs Baccon's family relationships in Australia for the purpose of identifying what light, if any, they threw on whether she had 10 years qualifying Australian residence. 28 Again the nature of the task that the Tribunal was required to undertake may be illustrated by hypothetical examples.
 Nature and extent of Mrs Baccon's employment, business or financial ties with Australia 30 The Tribunal noted that there was no evidence that Mrs Baccon was employed in Australia or retained any business ties with Australia although it considered the absence of employment or business ties to be not unusual for a person of retirement age.
 The Tribunal also observed that details of Mrs Baccon's financial ties with Australia were sparse. 31 Again, the Tribunal's reasons for decision do not suggest that it gave consideration to the nature and extent of Mrs Baccon's employment, business and financial ties with Australia since 1988 for the purpose of determining whether she had 10 years qualifying Australian residence.
