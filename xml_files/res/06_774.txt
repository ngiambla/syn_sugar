 Luxottica also argued that it will be difficult for it to recruit another qualified optometrist. 23 Additionally, Luxottica argued that, as neither Mr Carr nor Ms Mackay has commenced new employment, the grant of interlocutory relief against Mr Carr will maintain the status quo.
 Conclusion 27 Having given consideration to the strength of Luxottica's case against Mr Carr, the extent to which damages will provide an adequate remedy to Luxottica should it establish at trial that Mr Carr has breached clause 23 of his contract of employment, and the balance of convenience generally, I conclude that Luxottica has not made out its case for interlocutory relief against Mr Carr.
 It did not point to evidence which suggests that Hinkler is in possession of any of Luxottica's confidential information or that Hinkler is a party to any breach of a fiduciary duty owed to Luxottica. 29 I conclude that Luxottica has not established that there is a serious question to be tried as to its entitlement to final relief against Hinkler.
