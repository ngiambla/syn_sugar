 The Tribunal concludes that based on Mr Homewood's current financial situation, which can be described as straitened, as well as his health needs and in particular that he is wheelchair bound and unable to even go on a waiting list to access appropriate housing, "special circumstances" do exist.
 It was necessary to the exercise of the power conferred by that section that the Tribunal identified 'special circumstances of the case' in which it thought it 'appropriate' to treat the whole or part of the relevant compensation payment as not having been made .
 What must appear from the reasons is why the discretion was exercised in the way it was. 42 The question in this case reduces to whether the Tribunal gave reasons for contracting the preclusion period to a period which expires on 1 July 2006.
 There may be other cases giving rise to special circumstances in which it is appropriate to treat a payment in whole or in part as not having been made notwithstanding that it has not been lost.
