 The appellant had given his consent to the Tribunal deciding the review without his appearing before it at the second hearing. 7 The appellant may be seeking to re-agitate on appeal the submission which failed before the Federal Magistrate, namely that the Tribunal breached the requirements for the giving of notice pursuant to s 425 and s 425A of the Act when, having found that it could not continue due to telecommunications difficulties, the Tribunal appointed a new hearing date.
 His Honour accepted that fresh compliance with sections 425 and 425A was not necessary when the Tribunal was acted under s 427(1)(b) adjourning a matter. 9 Even if there had been a breach of sections 425 and 425A, resulting in jurisdictional error, his Honour said that he would refuse relief on discretionary grounds, as the appellant through his adviser had advised the Tribunal that he did not wish to attend the adjourned hearing.
 On 4 June 2004 the applicants were advised in writing that the hearing had been adjourned to 18 June 2004. ' 12 If the Tribunal were obliged to comply with Regulation 4.35D with respect to the second hearing, it failed to do so and such failure would constitute jurisdictional error ( SAAP v Minister of Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 1009) .
