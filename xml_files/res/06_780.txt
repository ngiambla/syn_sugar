 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of O'Dwyer FM dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"): MZWMF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 513.
 The Tribunal fixed another hearing date, in short time, in response to which the Applicant again sought a further adjournment providing another medical certificate that indicated his inability to attend for another two days.
 The Tribunal again adjourned the matter, this time for a week and informed the Applicant that he would need to provide a more detailed medical report if he was to seek a further adjournment and also would need to provide a date on which the Tribunal could fix a hearing with some confidence he would be able to attend.
 His Honour noted that, in essence, the appellant was seeking impermissible merits review. 8 By notice of appeal filed on 21 February 2005 the appellant seeks an order that the judgment of O'Dwyer FM be set aside.
