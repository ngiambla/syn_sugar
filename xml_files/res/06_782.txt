 Nestl's intended use of GO ON... 71 If the trade mark is, to some extent inherently adapted to distinguish the designated or proposed designated goods, and had a capacity to distinguish the goods, Nestl's intended use of the trade mark becomes relevant (s 41(5)).
 Nestl checked the availability of the trade mark and rejected a first choice because of perceived difficulties with registrability. 73 Unilever does not dispute that, as at the date of registration, Nestl intended to use GO ON... but contends that such use was not trade mark use.
 The second phrase was intended to be ' about the consumer not the product ', ' evoking emotion '. 82 The intention, as recorded in the CTA, was to utilise a ' synergy of communication ' where ' showing a brand and product is not enough '.
 GO ON... is not such a trade mark. 94 While the intended use was of the constant, GO ON..., the different tag lines may have an effect on the distinctiveness of the mark as no single complete exhortation was intended to be in constant use.
