 The respondent pleaded that the applicant knew or ought to have known at all material times after July 2000, that the respondent was in financial difficulties and might not be in a position to pay any amounts to the applicant in excess of the amount invoiced by the applicant on a monthly basis. 70 The respondent denied that it repudiated the consultancy agreement, that the applicant accepted the alleged repudiation and that the applicant suffered any loss or damage as a consequence of the repudiation.
 Counsel for the applicant also said that the reference to the outstanding fee payments in the applicant's correspondence with Mr Elliott and Mr Jordan in early 2001 and Mr Hayes' letter to Mr Jordan of 29 June 2001 further demonstrated that the forbearance of the applicant was temporary and that it had not abandoned its right to claim the full contractual fee.
