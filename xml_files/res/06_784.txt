 It is common ground that Mr Nikolich protested to Mr Sutherland about this reallocation and claimed Mr Sutherland had gone back on his word. 38 The terms of the protest conversation are in dispute.

 In his second affidavit, Mr Nikolich said: 'I understood [WWU] operated as an express term of my contract of employment as it contained policies and procedures regarding important matters of legal compliance.
