 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrate of 6 March 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of 6 October 2005: see SZHIJ v Minister for Immigration Anor [2006] FMCA 274.
 The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate of the Minister to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa. 2 The only issue of substance that arose in the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate was whether the Tribunal was entitled to make a decision on the review on the papers without conducting a hearing.
 It seems to me that, in the ordinary course, where a party asserts in proceedings before a Federal Magistrate the existence of facts relevant to the application, the party should be required to give sworn evidence about those facts, at least where they are in issue.
 This Court can then deal with any application an appellant might make under s 27 for leave to adduce further evidence and apply the well settled principles concerning the grant of leave. 4 However, given the way the Federal Magistrate dealt with the facts asserted in the proceedings before him, I will treat the facts asserted by the appellant in these proceedings as fresh evidence.
