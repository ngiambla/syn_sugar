 The review applicant conceded that his results were not satisfactory for this semester in his evidence to the Tribunal and he explained the circumstances that led to his poor performance. ' 25 The Tribunal also said at [30]: 'As the review applicant has only three units to complete to attain his degree the Department may give consideration to waiving the three year ban on his being granted another visa.

 It is apparent that the Tribunal was conscious of the requirement to consider only the question of whether the education provider had certified that the applicant had achieved an academic result that was at least satisfactory, as opposed to any decision of the University in relation to the academic status of the applicant.
