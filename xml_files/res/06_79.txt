 However, his Honour was unable, on the evidence, to assign any value to that shareholding. 14 Nor was his Honour satisfied that other sufficient cause had been shown as to why the sequestration order should not be made.
 The onus of proof of those matters was upon the appellant. 42 In apparent compliance with the directions of 16 March 2005, the appellant had filed and served two lengthy handwritten affidavits of 11 and 30 March 2005.
 The appellant had been given an opportunity to present his evidence in the face of the evidence relied on by the respondents (essentially identified in the affidavit of Ms Prideaux of 3 March 2005); it includes the Statement of Affairs and the affidavit of Ms Langford.
 The further affidavit of the appellant, where it contained factual material and not argument, was inconsistent in significant respects with what the appellant had put in his submissions; proper reasons for the change of view were not proffered.
