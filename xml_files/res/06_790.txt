 The respondents submit that they have the limited benefit of security for costs ordered earlier in these proceedings and that that security should not be eroded by further costs incurred on account of delays for which they are not to blame. 4 The respondents rely upon an affidavit which sets out the various defaults said to have led to the late commencement of the trial.
 However that is an ongoing issue which had no bearing on the adjourned commencement of the trial. 11 The delay to the commencement of the trial has been effectively one and a half days, being all of Monday 12 June 2006 and the afternoon of Tuesday 13 June 2006.
 The preparation, which the respondents claim was prejudiced on account of the applicants' defaults, would no doubt have been conducted earlier but for those defaults. 12 It will not be easy for the respondents to identify costs actually thrown away by reason of the delay for the commencement of the trial.
