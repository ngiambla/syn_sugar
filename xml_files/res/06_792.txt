 His evidence was that Barry Armitage and his son had failed to keep appointments with counsel and to provide him with instructions for the conduct of the matter, notwithstanding his numerous calls to their cell phones and place of residence.
 Counsel said that Ms Wu's hardship was especially relevant "in circumstances where Mr Armitage now represents himself and incurs no costs while [she] continues to do so". 19 In written submissions dated 21 June 2006, Ms Wu submitted that the evidence of Mr Liberogiannis showed his communication, and attempted communication, with Mr Armitage and his son.
 As Mason P, with whom Meagher and Clarke JJA agreed, said in Rosniak v Government Insurance Office (1997) 41 NSWLR 608 at 616, "the court requires some evidence of unreasonable conduct, albeit that it need not rise as high as vexation" before departing from the usual party and party costs order.
 This justifies an award of indemnity costs on the motion in Ms Wu's favour; and no countervailing reason has been shown for not making such an order. 47 Order 62 rule 3(2) permits the Court to order that costs be paid forthwith notwithstanding that the proceeding has not concluded.
