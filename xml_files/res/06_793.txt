 The taxing officer disallowed a number of items of costs claimed by the respondents' instructing solicitor including items relating to the preparation for the first directions hearing, conferring with the respondents and attending Court for the hearing of the strike out application as instructing solicitor.
 The major component of the amount allowed was the sum of $2600 for counsel's fees. 6 On 10 August 2005, the applicant filed a motion for the taxing officer to reconsider four items of the bill of costs which had been accepted by the taxing officer.
 The applicant submitted that: '...at a stretch the item should only be recoverable as a telephone attendance that should have been made by a practitioner's secretary --- and is hardly requiring the attendance of a solicitor. ' 16 The applicant also submitted that the item should not be allowed because senior counsel had not charged for the item. 17 In my view, the applicant's submission is not to be accepted.
 The respondents cannot be criticised for taking the claim seriously and taking proper steps to seek to bring the claim to an early end. 23 The applicant also submitted that the brief included work on the question of whether the application was statute barred.
