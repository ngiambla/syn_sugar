 The District Court declined to stay the proceedings before it to allow the application to the Federal Magistrates Court to be heard and determined. 4 On 1 July 2005 Mr George Elias filed a holding summons for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of the District Court.
 The Court was invited on 13 September 2005 to note that, on or before 27 September 2005, Mr George Elias would procure an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee in favour of the trustee in the amount of $80 000.00 which the trustee would be entitled to call upon should the appeal from the judgment of the District Court be dismissed, withdrawn or discontinued.
 Reasonableness of parties' conduct 14 The Bankruptcy Act recognises that the Court may extend the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice where proceedings to set aside the judgment in respect of which the notice was issued have been instituted by the debtor (s 41(6A)(a)).
 However, he must be assumed to have understood that, if the judgment were set aside on appeal, the judgment debt on which the bankruptcy notice was founded would no longer exist and the notice would be liable to be set aside. 16 The judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the judgment of the District Court was unanimous.
