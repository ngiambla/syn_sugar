 On 23 November 2004 a delegate of the Minister refused to grant a protection visa. 8 On 30 December 2004 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision, and on 17 January 2005 the applicant was invited to attend a hearing before the Tribunal on 23 February 2005.
 On 24 February 2005 the Tribunal decided to affirm the delegate's decision and it handed down that decision on 17 May 2005. 9 The applicant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his membership of a particular social group or political or religious opinions.
 The applicant claimed that in December 1999 he was placed in detention for a period of one month and that in December 2002, after taking part in a demonstration against the local government, he was placed in detention for two months and forced to attend re-education classes. 10 The Tribunal was not satisfied on the information presented to it that the applicant had a genuine fear of persecution or that there was a real chance that he would be persecuted.
