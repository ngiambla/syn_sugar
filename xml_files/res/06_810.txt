 By this time the Deputy Commissioner had put forward a further argument and that was that there was no need for an order terminating the voluntary winding up and that I could simply make an order winding up the company in insolvency. 8 The advertising and other requirements of the Corporations Act have been complied with and the liquidator consents to an order that the company be wound up in insolvency.
 If the answer to the first question is yes, is it necessary to first make an order terminating the voluntary winding up? 10 Because of the importance of the second question to the Registrar's jurisdiction to make the orders sought in this and similar cases, I propose to deal with the second question first. 11 The Deputy Commissioner's application is made under s 459P of the Corporations Act and she seeks an order under s 459A that the company be wound up in insolvency.
 That reason will be sufficient if the liquidator has not given the appearance of being independent: Citrix Systems Inc v Telesystems Learning Pty Ltd (in liq) (supra) per Moore J at 535-537, but, on the other hand, a mere desire to replace a liquidator is not sufficient: Re Green (as liq of Australian Resources Ltd (in liq)) (supra).
 The fact that there is no opposition to the proposed order cannot, to my mind, be a good reason for making the order; nor can the desire to recover costs, although I appreciate that the Deputy Commissioner made her application some days before the company was placed into administration and then later into voluntary liquidation. 20 I see no good reason to make an order that the company be wound up in insolvency in circumstances where it is already in voluntary liquidation.
