 The basis of the application is the alleged insolvency of the company and the allegation of insolvency is grounded on the failure by the company to comply with a statutory demand: s 459C of the Corporations Act . 2 The application was listed for hearing before a Registrar of the Court on 29 March 2006 at 9.30 am. 3 Mr Martin was appointed the administrator of the company under Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act by the directors on 7 March 2006.
 With respect to orders in relation to winding up applications, item 48 of Schedule 2 to the Rules provides that a Registrar may exercise the powers in the following: ' sections 459A , 459B (except in respect of applications under section 246AA), 459C , 459D , 459P , 459R , 459S , 459T , 461 , 462 , 464 and 465B , 465C , 466 , 467 , 467A and 467B (except in respect of applications under section 246AA)' Of the above list, it should be noted that a Registrar may exercise the powers in ss 459A and 459B and, subject to an exception not presently material, in s 467B. 6 The Registrar considered that she did not have the power to make an order under s 482 and so she referred the application to a Judge of this Court. 7 The application came before me on 28 April 2006 and, on the application of the Deputy Commissioner for a short adjournment, again on 1 May 2006.
 By this time the Deputy Commissioner had put forward a further argument and that was that there was no need for an order terminating the voluntary winding up and that I could simply make an order winding up the company in insolvency. 8 The advertising and other requirements of the Corporations Act have been complied with and the liquidator consents to an order that the company be wound up in insolvency.
 If the answer to the first question is yes, is it necessary to first make an order terminating the voluntary winding up? 10 Because of the importance of the second question to the Registrar's jurisdiction to make the orders sought in this and similar cases, I propose to deal with the second question first. 11 The Deputy Commissioner's application is made under s 459P of the Corporations Act and she seeks an order under s 459A that the company be wound up in insolvency.
 It seems to me that s 467B contemplates an order winding up a company in insolvency even though the company 'is already being wound up voluntarily'. 13 I note that there was no suggestion in various authorities I have considered that an order terminating the voluntary winding up was necessary. 14 In Citrix Systems Inc v Telesystems Learning Pty Ltd (in liq) (1998) 28 ACSR 529, Moore J made an order that a company be wound up in insolvency in circumstances where it was being wound up voluntarily, and there was no suggestion that an order terminating the voluntary winding up was necessary. 15 In Re Green (as liq of Australian Resources Ltd (in liq) (2004) 52 ACSR 452, Barrett J made an order that the company be wound up in insolvency in circumstances where it was the subject of a creditors' voluntary winding up arising from a voluntary administration under Pt 5.3A and there was no suggestion that an order terminating the voluntary winding up was necessary. 16 In the circumstances, the Registrar's lack of power to make orders under s 482 is no obstacle to her power to make an order winding up the company in insolvency. 17 A court will not make an order winding up a company in insolvency in circumstances in which the company is already the subject of creditors' voluntary winding up unless there is good reason to do so: Carter (as liq of New Tel Ltd (in liq)) v New Tel Ltd (in liq) (2003) 44 ACSR 661 per Austin J at 663(5); Re Green (as liq of Australian Resources Ltd (in liq)) (supra) per Barrett J at 453 [5].
 The fact that an insurance policy responding to claims for insolvent trading by directors may cover such claims only if the liquidator is appointed by the court may be a sufficient reason: Re Green (as liq of Australian Resources Ltd (in liq)) (supra), as may the fact that a charge or certain dispositions of property may only be challenged if the court has ordered the company to be wound up under s 459A: Carter (as liq of New Tel Ltd (in liq)) v New Tel Ltd (in liq) (supra). 19 None of those circumstances are present in this case, nor is it suggested by the Deputy Commissioner that an order of the court winding up the company in insolvency will provide a benefit to the general body of creditors of the company.
 The fact that there is no opposition to the proposed order cannot, to my mind, be a good reason for making the order; nor can the desire to recover costs, although I appreciate that the Deputy Commissioner made her application some days before the company was placed into administration and then later into voluntary liquidation. 20 I see no good reason to make an order that the company be wound up in insolvency in circumstances where it is already in voluntary liquidation.
