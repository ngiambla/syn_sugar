 The appellant submits that this was the line of reasoning which the Tribunal adopted and that, providing its characterisation of the remunerative work the respondent was undertaking did not involve an error of law, its findings provided a basis for the conclusion that the requirements of s 24(1)(c) were satisfied. 33 In my respectful opinion, the Tribunal has erred in law.
 The Tribunal either characterised the remunerative work the respondent was undertaking as all six forms of employment previously referred to, but then applied the requirements of s 24(1)(c) to some only of these forms of employment, or it incorrectly approached the characterisation of the remunerative work the respondent was undertaking for the purposes of s 24(1)(c).
 I do not think that it does, because there is no evidence that the respondent undertook such work on a prolonged or repetitive basis for any period of time, or that he was qualified to undertake such work. 45 Having regard to those conclusions and to the other findings of the Tribunal, the requirements of s 24(1)(c) were satisfied.
