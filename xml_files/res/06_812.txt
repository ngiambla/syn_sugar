 The complaint was considered by HREOC in accordance with ss 5, 6 and 15 of the DD Act . 14 In considering the complaint, the delegate of the President of HREOC noted that HREOC had discretion not to continue inquiring into the complaint if satisfied that the subject matter of the complaint had been adequately dealt with by another statutory authority.
 That was not the case, pending the outcome from the investigation'. 51 Accordingly, the applicant's substantive claim could potentially fall within the terms of par 15(1)(c) in relation to the termination of his employment, or par 15(1)(b) in the context of his claim that he has not received a redundancy package. 52 The DD Act prohibits two types of discrimination --- disability discrimination (s 5) and indirect disability discrimination (s 6).
 CONCLUSION 66 Because of the lack of adequate explanation for the applicant's delay in filing the application, and the absence of merit in the substantive case of the applicant, I am not satisfied that it would be proper to grant further time in accordance with s 46PO(2) HREOC Act for the applicant to make an application alleging unlawful discrimination by the respondent.
