 The Australian Municipal Administrative Clerical and Services Union (the Union), which brought the proceedings, contended that he fell within the broader classification of 'Officer or Employee' and thus had entitlements to shift penalties which were not payable to a Community Services Officer. 2 On 7 June 2005 the Industrial Magistrates Court made orders for the payment of penalties owing to Mr Van Der Waarden in the amount of $438.99 together with interest.
 The claim was brought under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the Act). 8 A statement of claim attached to the claim form referred to the Award and a Certified Agreement (the Agreement) to which both the Union and the City are parties.
 The Union claimed that the City had breached cls 21.6, 21.8.1 and 22.1.1 of the Award, read in conjunction with cl 13 and Appendix 1 of the Agreement by not paying Mr Van Der Waarden entitlements to shift work weekend and holiday penalties under cl 21.6, shift work penalties under cl 21.8.1 and overtime penalties under cl 22.1.1 for the pay period 4 July 2003.
