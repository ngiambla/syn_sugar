 The claim was brought under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the Act). 8 A statement of claim attached to the claim form referred to the Award and a Certified Agreement (the Agreement) to which both the Union and the City are parties.
 The reasons for decision in the Industrial Magistrates Court 36 After setting out the relevant terms of the Award the learned Industrial Magistrate observed that a Community Services Officer at the City works rotating shifts to cover 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
 However, when a comparison is made between the things Mr Van Der Waarden was required by his Contract to do and the things set out in the definition of Community Services Officer (Welfare and ancillary services) the latter does not, in my opinion, embrace the former.
