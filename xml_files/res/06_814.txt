 For the reasons that follow I am prepared to vary the orders by extending the scope of the definitions of 'Individual Property' and 'Corporate Property' as requested by ASIC save for par 3.6 which relates to property held by trustees and, in the case of individual defendants, par 3.7 which relates to properties held by third parties on behalf of a superannuation fund in which the individual defendant is a beneficiary.
 They include the right to inspect the trust documents --- Re Londonderry's Settlement [1965] Ch 918 and the right to require the trustee to provide information about management of the trust fund --- Spellson v George (1987) 11 NSWLR 300; Hartigan Nominees Pty Ltd v Rydge (1992) 29 NSWLR 405.
 It was submitted that the Court could make the orders sought on the basis that any of the defendants who is a beneficiary of a discretionary trust has a 'contingent interest' in the property of the trust which therefore constitutes property as defined in s 9 of the Act. 32 ASIC submitted that a contingent interest in property equates to a proprietary interest.
