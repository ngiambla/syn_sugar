 All I am appealing you now is just only interim order to a new sequestration order and then the man who is sitting here, this would prevent the sheriff coming to my unit to drag me out, this is what they are going to do, not pay the rates, and then I will find myself on the street and at the same time, ridiculously speaking, I have a proceeding here, a new sequestration order which is rendered meaningless. ' 8 Having read the bundle of documentation produced to me by Mr Mahmoud and re-read his submissions contained in some 23 pages of transcript, I am simply unable to distil any conceivably viable basis for the grant of any juridical relief, at least by this Court.
 Whilst I would like to record that Mr Mahmoud was not at all unpleasant or overbearing in his appearance before the Court, and was in obvious distress, there is simply no basis that I have been able to identify whereby at least this Court can extend to him any juridical relief concerning his apparent eviction from the home unit in Ashfield. 9 If there was any conceivable basis for convention of any process of mediation between a representative of the Body Corporate and Mr Mahmoud, so much would be welcome from my distant and essentially uninformed perspective, but so much appears to be too late in the day, as it were, Mr Mahmoud and his protagonist having been locked in apparent irreconcilable dispute for some years, with little or no prospect of resolution. 10 I therefore would decline the provision of any interim relief from this Court.
