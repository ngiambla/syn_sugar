 More specifically, the changes or adaptations to those laws and customs are not of a kind that would result in the native title rights and interests asserted not being possessed under the traditional laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the Yawuru community.
 The Yawuru claimants' riposte was that the Djugan were a clan or subgroup of the Yawuru people, spoke a dialect of Yawuru and always formed part of the Yawuru community that possessed native title rights and interests in the Yawuru claim area.
 As explained in these reasons, historically the Djugan (and their practice of the northern tradition) have been associated with the northern area and the Yawuru (and their practice of the southern tradition) have been associated with the southern area.
