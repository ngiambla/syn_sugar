 In that regard, the Tribunal emphasised (at [33] of its reasons) 'That place must be in the insulated vehicle' . 17 To Item 36 may be added reference perhaps for completeness to Item 38, headed Mixed activities [R] , which reads as follows: '(1) Goods (the exemption goods) for use by a person (the exemption user) mainly in carrying out 2 or more activities described in subitem(1) of exemption Item 1, 2, 18, 23, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34 or 35.
 The Commissioner pointed out uncontroversially that the operation of the statutory period in the subject circumstances was required by that Table to start at the time when the goods are first applied to a person's own use in Australia (the latter expression reflecting what I have earlier identified as the statutory abbreviation AOU ), and to end 2 years after the time of that first application to the person's own use.
 The evidence reflects the fulfilment by Lindsay of those respective statutory factors isolated in subpar (iii) above. 51 The further issue formulated by Lindsay remaining perhaps for resolution, concerning its fulfilment of Item 36, was whether the refrigeration of temperature-sensitive goods, such as was implemented by Lindsay in the course of its transportation activities relied upon, was indeed a process or treatment which was applied to the goods carted by Lindsay within the meaning of that description relevantly appearing in the subItem 18(5) definition of manufacture - related activity .
 It was Lindsay's case that it was unnecessary for it to have been so registered in order to have qualified as an exemption user by way of a subcontractor falling within Item 36, and those provisions thereof which crystallise by virtue of activities the subject of Item 18, Lindsay having been engaged in that subcontractor activity which fell within the further scope of subItem 36(2), and which by subItem 36(4) is 'to be applied on the assumption that the principal concerned is registered at all relevant times'.
