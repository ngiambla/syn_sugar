 The position may be otherwise in circumstances where it could be shown that there was some default on the part of the Official Receiver, such as issuing a notice in an incorrect form, which led to its being set aside or where it was manifest on the facts set out as part of the Notice that there was no basis for the claim to be made out.
 However, it is not necessary, in my view, for the Official Receiver to embark on a detailed investigation as to the factual or legal merits of the claim which forms the basis of the request for the Notice. ' (emphasis in original) 21 In the circumstances his Honour ordered that Citibank's costs be paid by the trustee who had requested the issue of the notice by the Official Receiver, but not the Official Receiver herself. 22 Another case dealing with costs to which I have been referred is Terry v Terry; Ex parte Prentice [1994] FCA 1031 (Lindgren J, 9 December 1994, unreported).
 By letter dated 31 May 2006 the Official Receiver declined to do so, notwithstanding the institution of the proceedings challenging the Notice and the earlier communications emanating from the Official Receiver to which I have referred. 35 On 30 May 2006 the solicitors for the Trustee expressed the desire that the Notice should not be revoked and said, amongst other things, that the Administrator had elected to proceed by way of a Court application to have the Notice set aside and that it was 'inconsistent' to now request the Official Receiver to revoke the Notice.
