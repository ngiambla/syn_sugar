 The position may be otherwise in circumstances where it could be shown that there was some default on the part of the Official Receiver, such as issuing a notice in an incorrect form, which led to its being set aside or where it was manifest on the facts set out as part of the Notice that there was no basis for the claim to be made out.
 I am not satisfied that the Notice can be construed as one which seeks to impose a personal liability on the Administrator rather than a bare liability on the Company of which he was the Administrator. 31 If I understand it correctly, one of the points taken by the Administrator as early as 22 February 2006, in respect of the Notice, was that the s 139ZQ procedure was inappropriate and the Trustee should have proceeded simply by way of lodgement of a proof of debt with the Administrator in the Company's administration.
 In my opinion, this declaration of intention is consistent with a proper construction of the Notice itself. 33 In relation to the s 129 Notice of Demand, it was acknowledged by the Trustee in the points of defence filed 15 May 2006 that the s 129 Notice of Demand was bad. 34 The solicitors for the applicants invited the Official Receiver to withdraw the s 139ZQ Notice.
 By letter dated 31 May 2006 the Official Receiver declined to do so, notwithstanding the institution of the proceedings challenging the Notice and the earlier communications emanating from the Official Receiver to which I have referred. 35 On 30 May 2006 the solicitors for the Trustee expressed the desire that the Notice should not be revoked and said, amongst other things, that the Administrator had elected to proceed by way of a Court application to have the Notice set aside and that it was 'inconsistent' to now request the Official Receiver to revoke the Notice.
