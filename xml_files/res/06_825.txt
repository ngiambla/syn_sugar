 The debt upon which the bankruptcy notice was based was the taxed certificate of costs, plus interest. 4 The bankruptcy notice was served on Mrs Maxwell-Smith on 2 May 2006, but on 15 May 2006 Mrs Maxwell-Smith filed an application in this Court to set aside the notice.
 As a result, Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith brought proceedings against S E Hall in 1996 and 1997 in the Consumer Claims Tribunal concerning the construction of the house. 15 On 25 February 1998, the Consumer Claims Tribunal handed down its decision and ordered that Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith pay to S E Hall the sum of $6,745.55 by 1 April 1998.
 The only named creditor was S E Hall. 25 In or about October 2004, S E Hall garnisheed Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith's bank to recover an amount of $9,700 which satisfied, in part, Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith's liability for costs in the Supreme Court proceedings. 26 I have set out above the dates of issue of the bankruptcy notice, service of the notice on Mrs Maxwell-Smith and the filing of the present application.
