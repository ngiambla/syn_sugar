 As a result, Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith brought proceedings against S E Hall in 1996 and 1997 in the Consumer Claims Tribunal concerning the construction of the house. 15 On 25 February 1998, the Consumer Claims Tribunal handed down its decision and ordered that Mr and Mrs Maxwell-Smith pay to S E Hall the sum of $6,745.55 by 1 April 1998.
 The requirements of s 40(1)(g) and 41 (7) of the Act 27 In order to fall within s 40(1)(g) and s 41(7) of the Act , the debtor must satisfy the Court that he or she had a counter-claim, set off or cross-demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt.
 Instead, there was no evidence from S E Hall explaining the delay or demonstrating that Mrs Maxwell-Smith's financial position had deteriorated since 2004. 50 Curiously, Mr S J Hall, a director of S E Hall, has sworn an affidavit of 23 May 2006 denying Mrs Maxwell-Smith's suggestion that he is aware of her solvency.
