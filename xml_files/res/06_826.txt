 Mr Smith stated that the factor considered in deciding whether to object "to any particular licence application" was the protection of Woolworths' business of selling takeaway liquor by retail.
 Woolworths also admitted that the deed was a contract, arrangement or understanding made or arrived at between persons two of whom (Woolworths and Liquorland) were competitive with each other in the supply of takeaway liquor.
 It is important to recognise that there was a difference of expression (of some importance) used by Mr Higgs between "price sensitive" and "price conscious" in particular in describing customers.
