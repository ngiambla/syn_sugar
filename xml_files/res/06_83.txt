 Accordingly, charges 3(a), (b) and (c) are to be dismissed. 8 Charges 3(d) and 7 are to the effect that on 19 June 2005 the respondents sold a shoulder bag packaged in a protective dust bag, both of which bore one or more Louis Vuitton trademarks, which trademarks were not applied with the licence or authority of the applicant.
 Maskiell pleaded guilty to the charges and I am satisfied that they have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against both Maskiell and Design Elegance. 10 Charges 3(f) and 7 are that on 6 July 2005 the respondents sold a belt packaged in a cardboard box, both of which bear one or more Louis Vuitton trademarks which trademarks were not applied with the licence or authority of the applicant.
 Maskiell's counter-offer was accepted and the settlement was recorded in the Deed referred to above. 50 It was contended on behalf of Louis Vuitton that, by the correspondence and the Deed, Louis Vuitton only agreed to settle its civil claims for trade mark infringement, passing off and misleading conduct and did not agree to settle the contempt claim.
 While that is a reasonable contention given the Deed executed by Maskiell, the contention ignores the fact that Corrs' correspondence with Maskiell was plainly calculated, and was likely, to induce her to comply with Louis Vuitton's demands on the basis that if she did so contempt proceedings would not be pursued.
