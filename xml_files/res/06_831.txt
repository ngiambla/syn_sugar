 I do, however, consider that it is relevant for the purposes of assessing the interests of justice in the context of the present case to have regard to the fact that there are serious allegations of fraud made against the fifth respondent and to have regard to what counsel for the applicant, Ms Williams, accepted was appropriate at this stage of the argument, namely that, as Sackville J adverted to in par [69], that I should look at this on the basis that I should accept the applicants' evidence at its highest and not at this stage consider issues as to credit. 4 This application has been made, as Mr Wood frankly conceded, without any notice to the applicants.
 In the case before Sackville J, two days were said to be saved. 6 I am of the opinion that it would unfairly disrupt the trial to permit the fifth respondent to make an application of a no case nature without requiring it to elect whether or not to call evidence. 7 In my opinion it is in the interests of justice in a case such as the present where the circumstances said to give rise to the liability of the fifth respondent occurred during the course of communications and meetings at which the other parties to the proceedings or their human principals were present or involved, allegedly at the same time, that one party should not be allowed, as it were, to seek to extricate themselves entirely without having to make the election that, if it fails it, will not be in a position to call evidence.
