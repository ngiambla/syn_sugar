 The loan agreement obliged Consort to use the net proceeds of the AUD 6.75m to assist Rho Beta 7 with the acquisition of the vessel and, relevantly to apply them for no other purpose. 17 On completion of the purchase, Rho Beta 7 was to be the sole beneficial and legal owner of the vessel free from any encumbrance other than the ship mortgage in favour of ANZ.
 Consort was obliged to ensure that Rho Beta 7 complied with all its obligations under the ship mortgage, the charge and guarantee given by Rho Beta 7 to ANZ. 18 A considerable number of events of default were defined under the loan agreement, one of which, significantly was in cl 16.1(i).
 He arrived at that valuation on the basis that the cost of repairs, restoration work and substitute vessel hire actually incurred by Consort were necessary to bring the vessel to the standard at which it would have been worth the purchase price of USD 3.5m accounted for the difference in value.
 CONCLUSION AS TO DAMAGES FOR REPAIRS 79 Having reviewed the evidence in the schedule, and the affidavit material relied on by Consort before me, I am satisfied that the costs claimed and the repairs and restoration work performed which are the subject of those claims were reasonable.
