 The final paragraph of the reasons read: '[100] The respondent is liable to pay the applicant's costs in both applications. ' 7 On the title page of the Tribunal's reasons for decision there appeared the heading 'Decision' and underneath it a description of the three members constituting the Tribunal, the date of the decision, its place and the result of the review of the 2001 and, then, the 2002 proceedings.
 The outcome of the second Tribunal decision was that, relevantly, the senior member determined that no costs could be awarded in the 2002 proceedings because notwithstanding [100] of the reasons for the first decision, s 67(8) of the SRC Act only entitled a successful applicant to costs, and there was no provision in that or any other legislation which entitled the Tribunal to award costs to an unsuccessful applicant. 10 The second Tribunal held that there was no power for it to review any costs in relation to the 2002 decision because the reviewable decision was affirmed and Ms Keen was not entitled to any costs in that matter.
 It is for that reason that s 69A(1) of the AAT Act includes a reference to any other Act, which was intended to refer to, among others, the power to award costs under s 67(13) of the SRC Act. 25 Ms Keen initially argued that notwithstanding s 67(8) of the SRC Act, the first Tribunal had power to make a decision that the costs of the 2002 proceedings be paid, notwithstanding that the Tribunal had affirmed the dismissal of Ms Keen's application.
