 If successful the motion will not only restore Overlap Area 20 to the Arabunna claim and excise it from the Kokatha overlap proceedings, it will require that the claims of all of the Overlap Area 20 claimants be determined in the Arabunna claim (SAD 6025 of 1998). 4 The Orders of Mansfield J and the present motion invoke the jurisdiction of the Court under s 67 of the Native Title Act .
 That section provides: " 67 Overlapping native title determination applications (1) If 2 or more proceedings before the Federal Court relate to native title determination applications that cover (in whole or in part) the same area, the Court must make such order as it considers appropriate to ensure that, to the extent that the applications cover the same area, they are dealt with in the same proceeding.
 It is in my view inappropriate at this stage to venture any view on the relative significance of the area to the rival claimants. 12 Finally, and in my view of particular importance, I consider that the retention of the Arabunna claim in the Kokatha overlap proceedings is both desirable and necessary, not only for the informed case management reasons I gave earlier concerning Native Title claims in South Australia, but also because I consider that the evidence given by all of the various claim groups in relation to Overlap Area 20 may well inform or assist in casting light on issues that might arise in relation to lands contiguous to Overlap Area 20 where the other claimant groups and prospectively the Kuyani-Wilyaru have overlapping claims.
 Consistent with what I consider to be one of the policy imperatives informing s 67(1) (i.e. informed decision-making) it does not seem to me to be appropriate, or desirable, by acceding to this motion, to foreclose the opportunity of deriving possible assistance from material relevant to the Overlap Area 20 claim in making determinations in the remainer of the Kokatha overlap proceedings.
