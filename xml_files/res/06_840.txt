 The applicant says that the term ' defence service ' is used in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) (' Veterans' Entitlements Act ') rather than in the 1971 Act, and that a test of ' defence service ' was the incorrect test. 15 The applicant further submits that the Tribunal did not apply the correct interpretation of ' performance of duties ' as referred to in s 7 of the 1971 Act.
 I am satisfied that the Tribunal used the words ' defence service ' merely as a description of the nature of the applicant's employment, and not with any intention to invoke a defined term with a specific legal meaning by reference to the Veterans' Entitlement Act. 21 Further, ' defence service ' is defined in s 68 of the Veterans' Entitlement Act as ' continuous full-time service rendered as a member of the Defence Force '.
