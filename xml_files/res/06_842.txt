 It is under that warrant that the applicant is presently detained. 17 On 31 December 2002 the applicant applied to the Supreme Court of New South Wales under s 21 of the Act for review of the order made by the Magistrate under s 19(9) of the Act.
 That application for special leave was refused by the High Court on 10 December 2004. 20 On the hearing of the motion presently before the Court the applicant in the proceedings, Mr Rivera, has made it clear that he does not by his current proceeding wish to impeach the decision of the Magistrate that he is eligible for surrender nor the subsequent appeals from that decision.
 The facts do not support this submission. 24 The evidence is that on 13 December 2004 the Attorney-General's Department wrote to Mr Rivera requesting that he provide any representations he may wish to make in relation to the decision to be made by the Minister under s 22 of the Act.
