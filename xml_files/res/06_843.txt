 The judge heard and determined an application for judicial review of a decision of a delegate of the respondent made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Migration Act '). 2 Under O 52 r 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules , a notice of appeal must be filed and served within 21 days after the date when the judgment appealed from was pronounced.
 However, he noted that the first applicant made no claims that violence had actually been perpetrated upon either her or any member of her family. 8 The delegate referred to country information available to him which referred to a 'litany' of economic and social discrimination against Indo-Fijians and in favour of indigenous Fijians.
 The delegate found that it was credible that complaints to the Fijian police in regard to threats of violence and abuse allegedly suffered by the applicant and her family had not resulted in an effective response, but he said that he had no evidence that if such threats were considered likely to be carried out there would be no appropriate response from the Fijian authorities. 9 As the first applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution, the claims for a protection visa were rejected. 10 The judge held that there was no jurisdictional error in the approach of the delegate.
 I think that it is arguable that the delegate took an unduly narrow approach to the issue of whether there was a well-founded fear of persecution and that there was a jurisdictional error. 17 The period of delay is short and there is an adequate explanation for the delay.
