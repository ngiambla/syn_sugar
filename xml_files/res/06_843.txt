 The delegate found that it was credible that complaints to the Fijian police in regard to threats of violence and abuse allegedly suffered by the applicant and her family had not resulted in an effective response, but he said that he had no evidence that if such threats were considered likely to be carried out there would be no appropriate response from the Fijian authorities. 9 As the first applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution, the claims for a protection visa were rejected. 10 The judge held that there was no jurisdictional error in the approach of the delegate.
 I think that it is arguable that the delegate took an unduly narrow approach to the issue of whether there was a well-founded fear of persecution and that there was a jurisdictional error. 17 The period of delay is short and there is an adequate explanation for the delay.
