 IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA VICTORIA DISTRICT REGISTRY VID 830 of 2004 BETWEEN: AXE AUSTRALASIA PTY LTD Applicant AND: AUSTRALUME PTY LTD Respondent AND BETWEEN: AUSTRALUME PTY LTD Cross-Claimant AND: AXE AUSTRALASIA PTY LTD Cross-Respondent JUDGE: FINKELSTEIN J DATE: 4 JULY 2006 PLACE: MELBOURNE RULING 1 The applicant has recovered judgment for $25,000 together with an order for its costs in a design infringement action.
 He did not, however, state in what circumstances he would permit a party to escape from its operation because in his case he found that the rule did not apply. 3 I do know from McCormick v Riverwood International (Australia) Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 32 that for the purposes of an application under O 62, r 36A(1) it is not relevant that the action could have been brought in another more suitable court, because that is covered by a different rule, namely O 62, r 36A(2). 4 In my opinion the rule reflects at least two different but related principles.
