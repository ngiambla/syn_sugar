 In a letter to the appeal department of Curtin dated 12 December 2003, the applicant explained his reasons for not completing the unit, Development (Principles of Programming) 200 and advised the appeal department of his intention to take the same unit as part of the forthcoming Curtin Business School Summer Program.
 This, said counsel, demonstrated that Curtin regarded the result obtained in the summer program as being irrelevant. 34 At the core of the applicant's contention before the Tribunal was that, after initially rejecting the appeal, Curtin had permitted him to enter the summer program and undertake the unit which he had not completed, and that he had passed the unit.
 However, it is also possible that had it addressed its mind to the issue, the Tribunal may have exercised its powers under s 359 of the Act to make inquiries of Curtin as to why Curtin had permitted the applicant to enter the summer program and the consequence for his academic result having completed and passed the outstanding unit.
