 1 On 29 May 2006 I provided reasons for judgment in relation to the application of Permanent Custodians Limited for the joinder of Macquarie Underwriting Pty Limited ('Macquarie') and SVB Syndicates Ltd ('SVB') as additional respondents to the present proceedings, pursuant to s 6 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) ('LR Act'), and made the following interim orders: '1.
 The applicant to provide to Macquarie Underwriting Pty Limited and SVB Syndicates Ltd at their address for service in Australia within seven days the text of the orders it proposes for the purpose of giving effect to the reasons for judgment, including orders as to costs of the subject interlocutory proceedings, and in relation to the matter of costs supported by reasons in writing. 3.
 The subject proceedings reflect the practical difficulties facing applicants for relief against undisclosed principal insurers, against whom there exists prima facie entitlement to indemnity pursuant to s 6 of the LR Act. 6 In the light of the complexity of the issues which have already arisen, the unresolved subject as to the costs of the interlocutory proceedings to date will remain reserved by the Court until further order.
