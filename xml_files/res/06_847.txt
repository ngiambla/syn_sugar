 1 On 29 May 2006 I provided reasons for judgment in relation to the application of Permanent Custodians Limited for the joinder of Macquarie Underwriting Pty Limited ('Macquarie') and SVB Syndicates Ltd ('SVB') as additional respondents to the present proceedings, pursuant to s 6 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) ('LR Act'), and made the following interim orders: '1.
 The applicant to provide to Macquarie Underwriting Pty Limited and SVB Syndicates Ltd at their address for service in Australia within seven days the text of the orders it proposes for the purpose of giving effect to the reasons for judgment, including orders as to costs of the subject interlocutory proceedings, and in relation to the matter of costs supported by reasons in writing. 3.
 Macquarie Underwriting Pty Limited and SVB Syndicates Ltd respond in writing within a further seven days. ' 2 I will adopt in these reasons the same abbreviated expressions as appear in those primary reasons for judgment. 3 Subsequently on 20 June 2006, two issues were further debated by the parties arising directly or indirectly out of matters recorded in those reasons, one being the circumstance that according to Australian Securities Investment Commission ('ASIC') records, Mr Teves was not formally disclosed as a director of ARMA in relation to the period from July 2001 to July 2004, notwithstanding that he had been earlier recorded as a director of ARMA since 15 December 1988, and ARMA bears all the indicia implicitly of a private family company.
 The subject proceedings reflect the practical difficulties facing applicants for relief against undisclosed principal insurers, against whom there exists prima facie entitlement to indemnity pursuant to s 6 of the LR Act. 6 In the light of the complexity of the issues which have already arisen, the unresolved subject as to the costs of the interlocutory proceedings to date will remain reserved by the Court until further order.
