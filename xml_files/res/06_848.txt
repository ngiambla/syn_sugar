 The application contended that the Minister was under a statutory obligation to make the decision by 8 October 2004 and that he failed to do so. 2 After the institution of these proceedings, the Minister announced his decision on 3 April 2006.
 The applicant submits that the case attracts the principles which permit an order for costs to be made against a respondent where there has been no hearing on the merits, but the applicant has effectively achieved the relief sought by the proceedings.
 The letter also said that, in the view of the Department, the statutory time frame for making the decision had been refreshed and had not at that time expired. 10 There is no evidence of later communications between the applicant and the Minister.
