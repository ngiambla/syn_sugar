 In 1998, the Victorian Parliament passed the Miscellaneous Acts (Omnibus No 1) Act 1998 (Vic) ('Omnibus Act') which repealed the LAS Act and transferred the assets and liabilities of the Fund to the applicant. 5 As part of this process, the applicant executed a deed of trust on 26 June 1998.
 Each respondent was seeking to review a decision by the applicant to reduce his or her benefit by an amount that was described in two cases as a negative investment return and, in Mr Mathews' case, as negative interest. 49 Even if, contrary to my view, attention is focused solely on the trustee's determination to set a negative crediting rate for all deferred benefit members (and all LASPLAN members) in the relevant periods, this would not alter my conclusion that s 14(1) is satisfied.
 This may explain why Mr Poulter's member statement for the year ended 30 June 2002 referred to his benefit as a 'vested benefit'. 70 Under cl C.4.10(a)(2), the member is entitled to interest ' on the amount of that retirement benefit from the date on which that benefit falls due until the date it is paid' (my emphasis).
 It has no application unless, contrary to my conclusions, the word 'interest' in cl C.4.10 is read as meaning 'investment return. ' In my opinion, the obligation to pay interest under cl C.4.10 does not constitute or involve the determination of an investment return of the kind referred to in reg 5.03(2).
