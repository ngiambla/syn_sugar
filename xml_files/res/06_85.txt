 The submissions for the applicant state (with no objection being taken to the statement) that for the financial year ended 30 June 2004, the applicant made an after-tax loss of $374 000 and had net assets of $286 000. 31 I do not agree with the submission for the respondent that the different financial position of the parties is not a relevant issue.
 If, for example, the applicant continued with its present solicitors and selected counsel acting for it, the additional costs may not necessarily be much greater than those which the applicant would face if the litigation continued in the Queensland District Registry. 33 Counsel for the respondent also submits that any additional cost is a consequence of the applicant having unrealistically chosen representation from a location remote from the matters raised by the application and statement of claim.
 Further, if the proceeding was not transferred, the respondent would not be precluded from making an application at an appropriate time under O 30 r 6(2) of the Federal Court Rules for an order that the trial be held at a place other than the proper place.
 Further, there is no evidence that the solicitors and counsel presently chosen by the applicant could not continue to fulfil that role on behalf of the applicant if the proceeding was transferred. 41 Apart from that financial aspect, I consider that all of the other factors favour the conclusion that the ends of justice would be best served and the most efficient administration of the Court encouraged if the proceeding was transferred to the Queensland District Registry.
