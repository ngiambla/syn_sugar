 There was also a term that in any such fresh proceeding the parties could have the benefit of discovery already completed and documents already obtained on subpoena: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 112.
 In particulars sub-joined to par 1 of the statement of claim "(t)he colour Cadbury purple" is said to be the colour perceived in the shades in annexure A "including those shades of 'purple' which are substantially similar thereto".
 It was said the only explanation for Cadbury expending the "enormous resources" it had on this litigation was to "place enormous costs pressure on a much smaller entity in the chocolate confectionery trade and thereby achieving a 'positive' result through settlement".
