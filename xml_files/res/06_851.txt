 In Al Shamry the Full Court held that "the application" means the application for review by the Tribunal and does not include the information given by the applicant for the purposes of the initial visa application to the Department.
 It was put to his Honour that Al Shamry was distinguishable because the appellant had referred to the protection visa application form when asked about it by the Tribunal and said that the information in it was true and correct.
 His Honour said at [34] that the "inescapable conclusion" was that all of the information contained in the fax, which constituted the application for review as submitted to the Tribunal by the appellant's agent, constituted information that the appellant gave for the purpose of the application within the meaning of s 424A(3)(b).
