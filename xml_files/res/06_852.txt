 1 By application dated 12 May 2006 the applicants seek leave pursuant to s 58(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) to continue proceedings commenced in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the second respondent prior to his bankruptcy.
 The application is supported by the affidavit of Macaire Amanda Williams sworn on 12 May 2006. 2 The applicants are the liquidators of two companies, Reynolds Wines Limited and Reynolds Vineyards Pty Ltd ('the companies'), each of which is now in liquidation.
 Accordingly, by virtue of s 58 of the Bankruptcy Act , leave of this Court is required to enable the Supreme Court proceedings to be continued against him. 6 The order sought by the applicants proposes that leave be granted on condition that any order made in the Supreme Court proceedings under s 37A of the Conveyancing Act is to benefit the bankrupt estate of Mr Poolman, thereby ensuring that Mr Poolman's creditors are not disadvantaged. 7 The affidavit evidence discloses that there are intricate factual and legal matters, involving numerous parties, arising in the Supreme Court proceedings.
 This Court may grant leave under s 58(3) of the Bankruptcy Act if it considers that the issues would be better and more comprehensively dealt with by a contested trial of the action in the Supreme Court than would be the case if the applicants were required to lodge a proof of debt in respect of the bankrupt estate: see Allanson v Midland Credit Limited and Anor (1977) 30 FLR 108 at 114 per Bowen CJ, Riley and Deane JJ; Macquarie Bank Ltd v Bardetta and Ors (2005) 216 ALR 670 at [19]-[21] per Conti J. 8 I am satisfied that these considerations apply in the present case and that leave should be granted under s 58(3).
