 1 By application dated 12 May 2006 the applicants seek leave pursuant to s 58(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) to continue proceedings commenced in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the second respondent prior to his bankruptcy.
 The application is supported by the affidavit of Macaire Amanda Williams sworn on 12 May 2006. 2 The applicants are the liquidators of two companies, Reynolds Wines Limited and Reynolds Vineyards Pty Ltd ('the companies'), each of which is now in liquidation.
 Accordingly, by virtue of s 58 of the Bankruptcy Act , leave of this Court is required to enable the Supreme Court proceedings to be continued against him. 6 The order sought by the applicants proposes that leave be granted on condition that any order made in the Supreme Court proceedings under s 37A of the Conveyancing Act is to benefit the bankrupt estate of Mr Poolman, thereby ensuring that Mr Poolman's creditors are not disadvantaged. 7 The affidavit evidence discloses that there are intricate factual and legal matters, involving numerous parties, arising in the Supreme Court proceedings.
