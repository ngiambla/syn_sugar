 1 On reading the affidavits of Heather Ann Tropman, Gary David Coster and Robert Anthony Arnold, and hearing counsel, I am, subject to comments I make in a moment, satisfied that it is appropriate to make orders in the form amended and initialled by me, being based on the power expressly provided for in Order 25B of the Federal Court Rules and dealt with by way of practice note 24 dealing with search orders. 2 The requirements for the grant of the search order set out in Order 25B rule 3 require that the applicant show that it has a strong prima facie case on an accrued cause of action. 3 I am satisfied on the level of ex parte relief that there is a strong prima facie case on an accrued cause of action in relation to what appeared to be counterfeited goods or goods that breach copyright, being gambling machines, their artwork and associated computer software which appear to have been sold to parties in Peru by at least the first respondent, such transactions involving the second respondent in 2002.
 I think the better reading of O 25B, and not having had the assistance of opposing counsel, is the one put to me by Mr Cobden that the flexibility and amplitude of O 25B r 3 would be undermined if one read the search order as limited to the precise cause of action known. 7 Very often a wide number of apparent breaches are evident in these sorts of cases.
 Given the matters that have been proved, I accept Mr Cobden's submissions that this is appropriate. 10 The return date will be 5 July 2006, and the matter will be listed before Rares J, the Duty Judge on that day, at 9.30 am. 11 I have already made an order to the extent that it is appropriate and necessary to Auscript, to take all steps practicable to have the transcript of discussion of counsel this afternoon and my short reasons available by 9 am on Monday, 3 July 2006 so that they can be served. 12 I permit and direct Auscript to release the transcript of the judgment before settling in final form by myself in chambers.
