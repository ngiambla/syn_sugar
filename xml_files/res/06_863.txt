 The first was that the Company held Appletrees upon an implied trust for Mrs Wall, and that she had no intention, as the sole owner of Appletrees, to relinquish her absolute beneficial entitlement to the property in favour of her three children.
 The only possible purpose for the transfer of Appletrees to the Company was to ensure that Mrs Wall divested herself of beneficial ownership of the property, so that it would not form part of her estate for the purposes of assessment of death or estate duties in the event of her death.
