 The papers were supplied in response to an academic interest not for the purpose of a formal structural review of product efficacy. (d) Criticisms were made of the views expressed by Dr Harvey in the draft report of the quality and authority of the reports/papers sent to Dr Harvey.
 It seems to me that there is a serious question to be tried that the final report is affected by the misleading conduct of failing to provide the draft report to the sponsor and DWSG for comment and response before distribution to the parties who received it.
 In addition, the final report at pages 4 and 5 contains a description of the process of the investigation and it could not be fairly said that the description under the heading "Our Investigation" represents an accurate synopsis of the sequence of events.
 Therefore, the conduct of the working group and the formulation and publication of the draft report and final report is simply a process of intellectual discourse by engaged citizens relevantly skilled in the art with a view to forming a professional opinion.
