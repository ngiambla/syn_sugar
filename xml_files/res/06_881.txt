 The Federal Court's jurisdiction in respect of this claim arises under section 10 and section 17 and 4 (3)(d), (f), (o), (r) and (w) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). ' 4 The solicitor for the plaintiff, Ms Wilmshurst, swore an affidavit in support of the issue of the arrest warrant, on 9 June 2006 in which she said, relevantly, that the claim concerned various breaches of the time charter between the owners of the ship and the plaintiff.
 She exhibited a copy of what was said to be a charter party dated 19 April 2006 and a Liberian Permanent Certificate of Registry and a Certificate of Delivery of the Vessel. 5 The ship was arrested and the parties then agreed to its release on the provision by the owners of a letter of guarantee for $US3,500,000 issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
 Once the defendant appears unconditionally, the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) and Admiralty Rules contemplate that the defendant may then be made subject to whatever claims are available under the Australia law against it. 27 The plaintiff has said that it wishes to investigate whether or not some claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) can be made in the statement of claim to be filed.
 As I pointed out during argument, no application has been made under that Act at the present time although the orders I made earlier this afternoon permit the defendant to invoke that provision in an amended notice of motion which it must file by tomorrow, if it chooses to do so. 29 There being no application under the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) before the court, I am not enjoined to grant any stay or to consider what conditions might be applied were such a stay to be granted.
