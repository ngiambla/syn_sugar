 Secondly, they contended that the payments made by TSI and TSIA to the Commissioner did not constitute unfair preferences within the meaning of s 588FA, as they were not transactions between the relevant company (ie TSI or TSIA as the case may be) and its creditor within the meaning of s 9 and s 588FA.
 Scott also said that, until 13 May 2003, whenever he made a request for payment of any liability of either TSI and TSIA, those payments were made by Swift Malaysia and he had no reason to expect that those payments would not continue.
 Later in his evidence, Scott said that the undertaking by Swift Malaysia to be responsible for the liabilities of TSI and TSIA was the quid pro quo for the transfer of the shares in TSI and TSIA from TSI Inc to Swift Malaysia.
