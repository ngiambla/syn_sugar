 The opinion of the Administrators is that the Deed of Company Arrangement proposed by the two secured creditors is likely to provide a better return to creditors than the distribution likely to be made in the event of a winding-up. 6 The application for the winding-up order is pressed vigorously by the applicant creditor and is supported by affidavits from nine other creditors.
 The question is whether, on the material filed in support of the application for the adjournment of the hearing of the application for the winding-up order, the court is satisfied that 'it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up' (s 440A(2)).
 The payment of debts due to unsecured creditors as and when they fell due was entirely a matter within the determination of Mr Nunn as and when he chose to make funds available to the company by entities he controlled pursuant to fixed and floating charges granted in favour of those entities.
