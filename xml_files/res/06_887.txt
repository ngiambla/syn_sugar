 The opinion of the Administrators is that the Deed of Company Arrangement proposed by the two secured creditors is likely to provide a better return to creditors than the distribution likely to be made in the event of a winding-up. 6 The application for the winding-up order is pressed vigorously by the applicant creditor and is supported by affidavits from nine other creditors.
 The question is whether, on the material filed in support of the application for the adjournment of the hearing of the application for the winding-up order, the court is satisfied that 'it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up' (s 440A(2)).
