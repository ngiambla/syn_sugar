 Gibbs J said that s 190(b) of the Assessment Act placed the burden of proving that the assessment was excessive upon the taxpayer and that on ordinary principles the taxpayer therefore bore the burden of proving the facts necessary to make out his or her case (at CLR 301).
 His Honour said that the burden may be discharged by drawing inferences from the evidence, but he rejected (at CLR 303) the argument that a taxpayer can succeed simply because there is no evidence from which it can be concluded that the relevant purpose of profit making existed; since this would mean that the burden of proving the existence of that purpose lies on the FCT.
 That is that if Mr Vu was to be found to be assessable in respect of 50 percent of the monies in his wife's account there had to be a positive reason for so finding and for not inferring or presuming those monies were hers alone given Mrs Duy was the legal owner of the account.
