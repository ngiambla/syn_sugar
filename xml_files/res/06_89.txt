 The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application on the basis that the decision of the Tribunal was a privative clause decision and the application was incompetent because it had not been filed within the time prescribed.
 That decision was correct. 2 The Federal Magistrate's decision was made against a background in which the applicant had already litigated, in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court, the question of whether the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error in affirming the delegate's decision.
 On that occasion, the applicant made no submissions which would indicate that the application for an extension of time was likely to have any prospect of success, although it must be accepted that the primary focus of the discussion was directed to the question of whether an order should be made declaring the applicant a vexatious litigant.
 In that period, it will be open to the applicant to apply to the Court to set aside the orders if grounds for doing so can be established. 5 In my opinion, if time was extended and leave given, it is highly unlikely that the appellant would have any prospects of succeeding in the appeal.
