 1 The appellant, Mr Maher, has appealed from a judgment of Federal Magistrate McInnis in which his Honour ordered that Mr Maher pay costs in the sum of $2,000. 2 The substantive proceeding before the Federal Magistrate was an application by Mr Maher to set aside a bankruptcy notice.
 McInnis FM did not consider it appropriate to award costs in respect of the 11 April 2005 adjournment, in his 28 July 2005 reasons for judgment. 6 The matter was next before the Court below on 30 May 2005.
 Counsel also told his Honour that Mr Maher had filed an application in this Court to set aside the order which founded the bankruptcy notice. 10 At [7], McInnis FM said: "Ultimately the adjournment of 20 July 2005 was an adjournment granted in circumstances which were really peculiar to [Mr Maher' s ] position, and then ultimately as a result of the Federal Court proceedings which occurred thereafter, the applicant's position was somewhat strengthened on grounds not previously raised formally in the material before this Court. " 11 His Honour awarded the respondents $1,400 in respect of the costs of the adjournment on 20 July 2005.
