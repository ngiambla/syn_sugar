 1 The appellant, Mr Maher, has appealed from a judgment of Federal Magistrate McInnis in which his Honour ordered that Mr Maher pay costs in the sum of $2,000. 2 The substantive proceeding before the Federal Magistrate was an application by Mr Maher to set aside a bankruptcy notice.
 McInnis FM did not consider it appropriate to award costs in respect of the 11 April 2005 adjournment, in his 28 July 2005 reasons for judgment. 6 The matter was next before the Court below on 30 May 2005.
