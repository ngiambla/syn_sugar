 It follows, that in my view, it is arguable that on the proper construction of the MOP Act there is a duty upon the respondent to exercise its statutory powers and discretions to give effect to the statutory purpose of conferring monopoly powers upon the respondent in relation to the purchase and sale of commercial potatoes in Western Australia.
 It is, therefore, also arguable that s 22 cannot be viewed in isolation from the other impugned provisions of the MOP Act, and that the validity or otherwise of s 22 has to be considered in the context of the extent of any duty imposed upon the respondent under the Act, and the validity or otherwise of the other impugned sections of the MOP Act.
 The pleading of 'market' 25 The applicants have pleaded in par 5 of the statement of claim that there is a market for purchase of potatoes by wholesalers from commercial potato growers in Western Australia. 26 The respondent complained that the pleading was embarrassing because a market requires both buyers and sellers, and the applicants had referred to only one side of the relevant transaction, namely the purchasers.
