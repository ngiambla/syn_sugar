 Where the Board has determined that a registration should be suspended, s 251K(3) provides for present purposes "a suspension of the registration of the tax agent shall be for such period as the Board concerned thinks fit". 4 As the Tribunal recognised in its Reasons for Decision, the most important issue in the case was whether the correct decision had been made in suspending Mr Iacono's registration, i.e. the s 251K(2) question.
 However, s 251K(3B) of the ITAA provides that the period of suspension under subsection (1) shall not be less than three months. [27] Therefore the Board's decision should be affirmed. " It is the above paragraph [26] which clearly gives an erroneous reason for rejecting the applicant's submission that was in issue in this appeal. 6 The Tribunal's decision was handed down on 17 February 2006.
 Being satisfied that there is an obvious error in the written statement of reasons for the decision of the Tribunal made on 17 February 2006, the Tribunal therefore directs, pursuant to s 43AA(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 , that the Registrar alter the said statement of reasons by substituting paragraph 26 with the following: Mr Athanasiou submitted that Mr Iacono's suspension as a tax agent should be for a period of less than three months.
