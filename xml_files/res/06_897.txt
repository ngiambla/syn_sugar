 I would refer the matter back to the Registrar for resolution in the event it does not do so. 3 The pleadings currently comprise the applicants' further amended statement of claim dated 10 February 2006, the respondents' proposed second further amended defence and cross-claim; the applicants' amended defence and cross-claim dated 29 April 2005; and the respondents' reply to the applicants' defence to amended cross-claim dated 1 August 2005.
 The nature of the respondents' proposed amendments are as follows: (a) an additional defamation claim in respect of the "sixth publication" (b) a further allegation of misleading or deceptive conduct in respect of the applicants' representations from at least 1 January 2005 to date; and (c) clarification of the defence concerning 640 questions/solutions forming part of the Practice Exams. 5 The applicants oppose the giving of leave, first, because the new claims will require additional pleading and further discovery and will delay the hearing of the proceeding.
 In the circumstances, subject to a matter that I am about to address, it is proper that the respondents have the opportunity to litigate, in this proceeding, matters of a like nature to their existing cross-claim. 7 In this connection, the remaining matter concerns the applicants' submission that the proposed new defamation claim would not be within the Court's jurisdiction.
 The Court held that there was a common substratum of facts even though the publication that gave rise to the misleading and deceptive conduct claim was separate from the publication that gave rise to the defamation claim: see Hunt at 746 [30]. 12 I accept that the alleged sixth publication forms part of the one controversy and, for the reasons I am about to give, can be said to arise out of the same substratum of facts.
