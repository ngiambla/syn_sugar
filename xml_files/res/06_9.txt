 There would be present 'an association' between any exercise of discretion by the Tribunal to remit penalty and the objection decision. 19 In my view, this misconceives the matter and puts an impermissible gloss upon s 43. 20 While the taxpayer did not include in his objection a ground putting in issue the imposition of additional tax; and while the Commissioner's objection decision disallowing the taxpayer's objection did not, in consequence, deal with that issue; and while the taxpayer had no right to agitate the issue before the Tribunal unless the Tribunal otherwise ordered (s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act), which the Tribunal did not, nevertheless, in deciding the taxpayer's objection, the Commissioner could have further remitted the additional tax imposed at label D of the notice of amended assessment, pursuant to the discretion vested in him by subs 227(3) of the ITAA 36.
 It is neither necessary nor permissible to put a gloss upon s 43 that would permit the Tribunal to exercise the discretion maker's powers and discretions only when those powers or discretions are necessarily interdependent with the decision under review, or where the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal is necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review --- see Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson [supra].
