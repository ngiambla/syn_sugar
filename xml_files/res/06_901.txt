 Section 170CK(2)(a) 25 The critical issue for determination in the proceeding is whether Parker Hannifin terminated Ms Crowley's employment for a reason which included the reason of her "temporary absence from work because of illness or injury within the meaning of the regulations". 26 Mr Flint considered Ms Crowley's absence was not temporary.
 The evidence suggests that Ms Crowley may have answered some work related queries during this period, but the evidence also shows that Ms Crowley submitted certificates from medical practitioners to show that she was unfit for work during the period 29 November 2004 to 8 March 2005.
 She provided no explanation for the delay at least in respect of the December 2004 absences. 31 Ms Crowley did not provide a medical certificate for her absence on 14 January 2005 until 18 January 2005, with no explanation for the delay.
 The sick leave application stated that 6 December 2004 (a Monday) was to be the return to work day. 40 A marked off desk calendar, kept by Mr Stack (Ms Crowley's former supervisor) records her as being absent from work on all normal working days in December 2004.
