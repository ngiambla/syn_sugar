 Any question of extension of time would not arise unless and until Mr Christodoulou obtained the orders sought in the second motion. 11 Mr Bova also submitted that I should conclude that the Court had no power to set aside the notice of discontinuance because Mr Christodoulou had not satisfied either of the two possibly applicable criteria.
 The first requires it to be shown that the withdrawal is a nullity; the Court needs to be satisfied the discontinuance was not the result of a deliberate and informed decision such as where (to take some non-exhaustive examples) it is the result of fraud or mistake: R v Medway [1976] 1 All ER 527 at 543.
