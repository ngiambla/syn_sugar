 NN 4161 of 2005 was served on the Applicants on 22 November 2005, the time for compliance by the Applicants with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Notice is extended up to and including 17 January 2006. 2.
 The solicitor for the creditor had become aware of the application on or about 20 December 2005 by virtue of a search following which he had a telephone conversation with the solicitor for the debtors who promised he would fax a copy of the documents that day.
 The point of the notice is to draw to the creditor's attention the misstatement, thereby giving the creditor the opportunity to consider, for example, whether the bankruptcy notice should be withdrawn and a fresh notice, correcting the misstatement, issued.
