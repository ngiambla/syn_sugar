 The Applicant pay the First and Second Respondents' costs on a party and party basis, as agreed or taxed, thrown away by reason of: 1.1 the amendments to the Statement of Claim made on 10 May 2004; 1.2 the amendments to the Reply made on 8 June 2004; 1.3 the amendments to the Application and Statement of Claim made on 26 July 2004 pursuant to the leave of the Court granted on 23 July 2004; 1.4 the proposed amendments to the Application and Statement of Claim notified by the Applicant on 18 July 2005, 28 July 2005 and 24 August 2005; 1.5 the amendments to the Application and Statement of Claim made on 31 March 2006 pursuant to the leave of the Court granted on 30 March 2006. 2.
 From the little that I know about the matter thus far, the appearance is that, whilst the applicant is firm in its resolve to secure a commercial outcome which ensures that it is rewarded for its efforts in relation to the aeronautical publications in which it claims that copyright exists of which it is the owner, it does not want to, if I may use the vernacular, kick its bedfellows, the respondents, with whom it almost certainly will have an ongoing business relationship. 37 This appearance may have been the reason for its unwillingness, until 31 March 2006 to stand up and propound a case that ought properly occupy the time of the Court.
 All that was sought was declaratory relief in respect of the subsistence and ownership of copyright. 43 In a draft Second Amended Application forwarded by Corrs to Phillips Fox on 18 July 2005 a prayer for relief was added seeking a declaration that: '(a) the First Respondent is not entitled to reproduce or adapt the Copyright Works or any of them or any substantial part thereof, without the Applicant's licence or authority; (b) the Respondents or one or other of them has infringed and will infringe the Applicant's copyright in the Copyright Works; (c) the Applicant is entitled to restrain the First Respondent from reproducing or adapting the Copyright Works and each of them without its licence or authority. ' 44 Whilst the draft Second Amended Application included a prayer for relief for such further or other orders as the Court may consider appropriate, it is clear that, at least at that stage, the applicant had no interest in securing any injunctive relief against the first and second respondents or either of them or an order for damages or an account of profits.
