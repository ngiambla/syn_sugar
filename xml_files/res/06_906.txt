 The Applicant pay the First and Second Respondents' costs on a party and party basis, as agreed or taxed, thrown away by reason of: 1.1 the amendments to the Statement of Claim made on 10 May 2004; 1.2 the amendments to the Reply made on 8 June 2004; 1.3 the amendments to the Application and Statement of Claim made on 26 July 2004 pursuant to the leave of the Court granted on 23 July 2004; 1.4 the proposed amendments to the Application and Statement of Claim notified by the Applicant on 18 July 2005, 28 July 2005 and 24 August 2005; 1.5 the amendments to the Application and Statement of Claim made on 31 March 2006 pursuant to the leave of the Court granted on 30 March 2006. 2.
 From the little that I know about the matter thus far, the appearance is that, whilst the applicant is firm in its resolve to secure a commercial outcome which ensures that it is rewarded for its efforts in relation to the aeronautical publications in which it claims that copyright exists of which it is the owner, it does not want to, if I may use the vernacular, kick its bedfellows, the respondents, with whom it almost certainly will have an ongoing business relationship. 37 This appearance may have been the reason for its unwillingness, until 31 March 2006 to stand up and propound a case that ought properly occupy the time of the Court.
