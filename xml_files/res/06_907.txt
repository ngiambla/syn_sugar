 The alleged obligation to perform and observe the rules ... is thus the 'matter' upon which each proceeding between the present parties has been founded, namely the rule to show cause granted on 7 June, the interim orders made on 9 June, the appeal filed on 17 October, the motion for a stay of judgment filed on 25 October and the application for leave to appeal ... .
 In the result, their Honours determined that the application for leave to appeal had been instituted without reasonable cause. 10 In the principal proceeding commenced by the Employment Advocate against the respondent applicants, the essential question was whether, in respect of the termination of employment in August or September 2002 of 12 individuals by the relevant employer entity amongst the four respondent entities engaged in activity at the South Grafton Abattoir and the failure to re-employ any one of 11 of those individuals (recognising that one of them --- Susan Jane Young --- was not said to have been refused re-employment), once the process of re-engagement began in September 2002, occurred for reasons that either were or included prohibited reasons under the Act.
 The guiding mind of the respondent entities, Mr Stuart Bruce Ramsey, contended in his affidavit sworn 17 November 2004 that a shortage of available stock due to the combined affect of the loss by the abattoir of a proportion of a United States Beef Quota allocation (with a significant reduction in access to the United States market for beef product produced by the abattoir) together with the continued affect of drought conditions were the reasons for the closure of the abattoir.
 In relation to NCMCL, the notice of motion involves an application for leave to issue a subpoena seeking the production of five classes of documents described at [6] of the McIlwain decision [2005] (supra) all of which are directed to demonstrating that because NCMCL was able to secure and sustain a particular United States Beef Quota allocation and therefore maintain utilisation rates within the abattoir (so as to avoid the need to terminate the employment of workers and manage incremental re-employment), an inference might be drawn that a reduction in the quota allocation for the United States market available to the relevant Ramsey entity made it necessary to terminate the employees thus supporting the reason given by Mr Ramsey for the impugned conduct.
