 The alleged obligation to perform and observe the rules ... is thus the 'matter' upon which each proceeding between the present parties has been founded, namely the rule to show cause granted on 7 June, the interim orders made on 9 June, the appeal filed on 17 October, the motion for a stay of judgment filed on 25 October and the application for leave to appeal ... .
 The guiding mind of the respondent entities, Mr Stuart Bruce Ramsey, contended in his affidavit sworn 17 November 2004 that a shortage of available stock due to the combined affect of the loss by the abattoir of a proportion of a United States Beef Quota allocation (with a significant reduction in access to the United States market for beef product produced by the abattoir) together with the continued affect of drought conditions were the reasons for the closure of the abattoir.
 In relation to NCMCL, the notice of motion involves an application for leave to issue a subpoena seeking the production of five classes of documents described at [6] of the McIlwain decision [2005] (supra) all of which are directed to demonstrating that because NCMCL was able to secure and sustain a particular United States Beef Quota allocation and therefore maintain utilisation rates within the abattoir (so as to avoid the need to terminate the employment of workers and manage incremental re-employment), an inference might be drawn that a reduction in the quota allocation for the United States market available to the relevant Ramsey entity made it necessary to terminate the employees thus supporting the reason given by Mr Ramsey for the impugned conduct.
