 Mr Hearsch recommended that such an agreement should have an initial life of three years with an option for five year extensions. 249 Mr Hearsch commented also on the advantages and disadvantages of the grant of a long term lease over the AR terminal to NRC.
 I suspect that NRC may allow some form of access provide [sic] that suitable arrangements can be put in place. " March 2001: QR Presentation to NRC 473 On 8 March 2001, Mr Scheuber wrote to Mr Graham attaching a detailed proposal for access to the AR terminal.
 He had overall responsibility for the business operations of NRC and provided the Board of NRC with advice on strategic issues affecting NRC. 585 Mr Graham gave evidence about the interstate freight market and the establishment of NRC, including his understanding of the objectives of NRC and the means by which these objectives were pursued.
 Moreover, as I have been at pains to stress, from the outset, QR stated, without qualification, that it was prepared to negotiate in good faith for access to NRC. 1034 Although, as I have said, Mr O'Rourke was not an open and forthcoming witness, I accept his evidence that third party access was an important issue.
