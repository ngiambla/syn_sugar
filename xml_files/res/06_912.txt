 The matter was called today and nobody has appeared to oppose. 2 As I indicated when I made orders convening the meeting, I had scrutinised (without the benefit of a contradictor) the arrangement to ensure, so far as I could detect, that there was nothing on the face of it which might lead to a refusal of approval if the meeting assented to the transaction.
 I saw no such barrier and none has been pointed out to me since. 3 I drew attention on that occasion to a question which arises as to the means of enforcing arrangements such as these, including (although not restricted to) issues about solvency.
 I am satisfied by the evidence that there is both the capacity to meet the obligations which are being undertaken and willingness on the part of those involved to do so.
