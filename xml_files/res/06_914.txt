 He observed: 'In fact we had good evidence that his cardiologist was very happy with his cardiac state and that the malignant process supervened. ' 20 In its written reasons for decision the Tribunal accurately recorded that it was Dr Edwards' opinion that Mr Brown died of overwhelming sepsis, that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had reduced Mr Brown's ability to fight infection and that treatment for that illness had similarly compromised his immune state (see [17]).
 He agreed that he might have included ischaemic heart disease in part 2 of a death certificate for Mr Brown; that is, in the section of the certificate which Dr Edwards described as appropriate for recording 'contributing factors, factors that might be in the background, present for many years' .
 He contrasted factors of that kind with 'causes of death' . 23 Dr Edwards was not asked in cross-examination, or it seems at any time, to express an opinion on whether, because of his ischaemic heart disease, Mr Brown died from pneumonia earlier than would otherwise have been the case.
