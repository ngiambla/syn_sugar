 Mr Dunstan has, in my view, and in his circumstances, been given a proper opportunity to understand the nature of, and foundation for, the costs applications, and to respond to the material in support of them.
 Whether the respondents are entitled to costs 19 I have no hesitation in concluding that both the Commonwealth respondents and Mr Price should be entitled to their costs of the proceeding on a party/party basis.
