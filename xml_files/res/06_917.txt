 Whether costs should be fixed at a gross sum 13 In Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 3) [2006] FCA 916 (the main costs judgment) delivered at the same time as this judgment, I referred at [22]-[24] to certain of the principles relevant to deciding whether to make a gross sum order for costs.
 I will not repeat them. 14 The course of the taxation of costs thus far in these matters indicates that the process of taxing costs to date in these matters has been prolonged and expensive.
 An accompanying memorandum indicated that, as the defendant in each matter was represented by the same solicitor and as each matter was conducted simultaneously, many item costs had been apportioned to each bill of costs.
