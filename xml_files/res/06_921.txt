 Introduction 1 Mrs Jennifer Carter and her husband, Neil Carter, purchased a house and land in Boulder in 1989 with money advanced by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC).
 ATSIC also claimed interest, possession of the property and costs. 14 There followed extensive correspondence between AGS and Mr Ian Viner QC, who was assisting Mrs Carter in negotiations in an endeavour to settle the dispute.
 On 7 March 2000 AGS received instructions from ATSIC to take legal action to recover the debt due to ATSIC in full and to proceed with execution of the writ of possession.
