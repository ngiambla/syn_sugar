 It was then contended that the Tribunal had failed to apply that measure to his permanent protection visa application, but had erroneously simply had regard to whether, at the time of its decision, the test established by Art 1A(2) was satisfied.
 That is, it was claimed, the Tribunal when addressing Art 1C(5) had erred in law. 9 In my judgment, even if it be assumed that the Tribunal simply applied Art 1C(5) as a mirror of the Art 1A(2) test to the applicant's permanent protection visa application, the Tribunal has not committed jurisdictional error.
