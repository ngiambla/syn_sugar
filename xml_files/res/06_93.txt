 The RRT invited the appellant to attend a hearing on 19 January 2004 to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of his claim. 5 On or about 14 January 2004, the appellant responded to the hearing invitation and informed the RRT that he did not wish to attend a hearing. 6 The RRT's reasons for affirming the decision of the delegate were as follows:- "[The appellant] has submitted no documentary evidence in support of his claim to be a longstanding member of a political party, nor any evidence that he has been treated for serious injuries at any time.
 The first was that the RRT failed to give the appellant a "real and meaningful" invitation to attend a hearing, pursuant to s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act "). 8 Federal Magistrate Emmett noted that the RRT has no further obligations if the appellant consents to the RRT deciding the review without the appellant appearing.
 She observed that the RRT was entitled to proceed with the review. 9 Emmett FM noted that the appellant relied on an affidavit which stated that he received advice from his migration agent that although his wife was ill and he could not attend the hearing, the RRT would not change the hearing date and his written story would suffice.
 The appellant deposed that he trusted the agent, and took no further steps to request the RRT to reschedule or communicate the reason he was unable to attend. 10 The learned magistrate observed that the appellant cannot complain that his actions, taken in reliance on advice received from the migration agent, led to his being denied procedural fairness: B41 of 2003 in the matter of an application for a writ of mandamus prohibition and certiorari v Refugee Review Tribunal (2004) FCA 30 (" B41 ") at [25]. 11 The second ground in the application was that the RRT erred in failing to require the appellant to appear and give evidence, pursuant to s 427(3) of the Act .
 However I was a stranger to the country and not familiar with the system and I had no choice but to trust my migration agent. " 16 In written submissions in support of the appeal, the appellant relied upon the following statement of principle in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 ; (2003) 128 FCR 553 (" SCAR ") at [37]:- "...it is also clear that s 425 of the Act imposes an objective requirement on the Tribunal. " 17 The Full Court in SCAR gave as an example of the circumstances in which it had been held that the obligations imposed by s 425 have been breached as those where an invitation was given but the applicant was unable to attend because of ill health, citing Applicant NAHF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 140 ; (2003) 128 FCR 359 (" NAHF ") . 18 In NAHF at [26] to [27], Hely J considered the authorities on the current form of s 425.
 Dowsett J stated at [25] that the Chief Justice's observations in Hot Holdings and the apparent approval by a Full Court in Barrett v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 18 ALD 129 (" Barrett ") at 133 of an extract from the Court of Appeal decision in Al-Mehdawi may suggest that the decision of the House of Lords should be treated with caution.
 They said that, notwithstanding this, the RRT is authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant's absence. 25 In NADK of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 184 , a Full Court dealt with a claim by an applicant that his migration agent did not notify him of the hearing.
 Sackville remarked at [52] that the High Court has not greeted the decision in Ex parte A with "unalloyed enthusiasm"; see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1 ; (2003) 211 CLR 441 at [37] --- [42]. 28 Indeed, in STKB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 546 at [19] , Selway J was of the view that Ex parte A does not reflect the law in Australia.
 Their Honours said that an appellant cannot complain if his application is rejected because the decision maker without notice to him has rejected what was put forward; see also the observations of a Full Court in S58 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 283 (" S58 ") at [25] --- [26] which are apt in the present case.
 In my opinion the invitation dated 10 November 2003 was sufficient notice to the appellant of the risk; see S58 at [25] --- [26]. 37 The appellant also submitted that the observations of McHugh J and Kirby J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 at [150] and [219] support the proposition that it is open to the Court to take into account the fault of an applicant's adviser.
 The same principle must apply to the power to summons a person to give evidence under s 427(3). 40 Moreover, it is well established that it is no part of the decision maker's duty to make out an applicant's case for him or her; see Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 170.
 It is for an applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument he or she wishes to advance in support of the contention of the well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason; see Abebe v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at [187] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.
