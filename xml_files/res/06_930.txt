 Alternatively, it submits that each party ought pay its own costs and thirdly it submits that following inquiries made of a registrar of the court an amount of between $10,000 to $15,000 would be allowed on an assessment of a matter of this kind were it taxed. 3 Ms Keen argues that, excluding GST, her total costs of this appeal amount to about $38,000 including the $21,000 for solicitors' fees, $12,000 for counsel.
 Those amounts it should be noted include fees charged for attending the unsuccessful mediation which the parties voluntarily had with a registrar of the court. 4 The purpose of a fixed costs order under O 62 r 4(2)(c) is to save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter.
 It is a commonplace for the court to fix in administrative appeals under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) an amount of costs for a successful party. 7 In my opinion, it is appropriate that an amount of costs be fixed by the court so as to prevent yet further argument and delay in finalising this matter. 8 The consequence of the orders made today is that, regrettably, a further taxation must take place before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which will no doubt put these parties to even more expense.
 I do not think it would serve the interests of either party or the interests of justice to allow it to be protracted by having yet more taxations in this court where the issues are simple and the amount at stake in an ordinary appeal of this kind not large. 9 Doing the best I can having regard to the fact that Ms Keen succeeded on one of three grounds, that there was a failed mediation with a registrar of the court and that it was ultimately necessary for Ms Keen to come to the court to have her right to have a review conducted in accordance with law in the tribunal on the taxation of costs, I think that the appropriate figure to fix so as to avoid any further protracted dispute between the parties as to costs is the sum of $13,500 (see Order 4 in Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 834).
