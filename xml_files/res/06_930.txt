 Alternatively, it submits that each party ought pay its own costs and thirdly it submits that following inquiries made of a registrar of the court an amount of between $10,000 to $15,000 would be allowed on an assessment of a matter of this kind were it taxed. 3 Ms Keen argues that, excluding GST, her total costs of this appeal amount to about $38,000 including the $21,000 for solicitors' fees, $12,000 for counsel.
 Those amounts it should be noted include fees charged for attending the unsuccessful mediation which the parties voluntarily had with a registrar of the court. 4 The purpose of a fixed costs order under O 62 r 4(2)(c) is to save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter.
 It is a commonplace for the court to fix in administrative appeals under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) an amount of costs for a successful party. 7 In my opinion, it is appropriate that an amount of costs be fixed by the court so as to prevent yet further argument and delay in finalising this matter. 8 The consequence of the orders made today is that, regrettably, a further taxation must take place before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which will no doubt put these parties to even more expense.
