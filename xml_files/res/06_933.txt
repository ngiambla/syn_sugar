 1 The applicant on 17 May 2005 filed an application under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission Act 1986 (Cth) seeking an apology and damages in respect of loss and detriment caused to her while employed by the University of New South Wales.
 On the hearing to dismiss the proceeding the applicant was represented by counsel. 3 Since the commencement of the proceedings in May 2005, there have been eleven directions and interlocutory hearings and repeated failures by the applicant to cooperate in bringing the matter to a hearing.
 Despite the fact that the applicant had the benefit of twelve months to formulate and prepare her case, the Court was presented with a mass of unlinked material and no factual exposition of the applicant's position.
