 His Honour held that no reasonable cause of action was disclosed in that application and dismissed it. 2 The procedural history is that an application was filed on 20 January 2005 in which Ms Penhall-Jones claimed disability discrimination, as well as harassment and victimisation, as an employee with the New South Wales Department of Transport.
 The hearing was later adjourned until 10 April 2006. 4 The State filed an application on 6 February 2006 seeking dismissal of the proceedings under r 13.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules and this application was heard by his Honour on 20 February 2006.
 The State also said that there was nothing before the Court that could support the claim of indirect disability discrimination, and that there was no relevant connection between the asserted harassment and any asserted disability except as an alleged cause of the disability.
 However, Federal Magistrate Driver considered that even if it were so, Ms Penhall-Jones was unable to link the alleged behaviour to a disability. 14 The final allegation made to HREOC was that another supervisor, Ms Lange, had made inappropriate comments in relation to disability when the issue of stress was raised as an explanation for Ms Penhall-Jones' work performance.
