 None of the remaining plant and equipment has any significant commercial value. 13 Euco has not operated or gained any revenue since the commencement of the Deed, other than the receipt of the First Research Rebate which was provided to the Administrators.
 The order setting aside the termination will take effect so that the rights and obligations of all parties will be determined as though the Deed continued in effect from the meeting of creditors and had not been terminated.
 I will require notice to be given to all creditors of these orders and allow liberty to apply within 28 days for any variation of the order setting aside the termination of the Deed to the extent that it may impinge upon accrued rights.
