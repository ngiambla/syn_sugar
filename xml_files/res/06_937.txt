 1 The plaintiff ("WCG") applies under s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") for an order that a meeting of its members be convened to consider, and if thought fit, to agree to, a scheme of arrangement between WCG and its members ("the Scheme"), and, subject to their so agreeing, an order under s 411(6) of the Act approving of the Scheme.
 More accurately, it provided for an election between a Share Alternative and a Cash and Share Alternative. 9 In the present case, cl 6.1(a) of the Scheme provides that after the Court's approving order is made but before the "Implementation Date" (which is eight business days thereafter), MLB must deposit the aggregate amount of cash consideration payable to all Scheme Shareholders "in cleared funds in the trust account operated by WCG, to be held on trust for the Scheme Shareholders , except that any interest on the amount deposited shall be to MLB's account" [my emphasis].
 Clause 6.2 of the Scheme provides that MLB's obligation to issue shares to the Scheme Shareholders is to be performed by its entering their names in the Share Register on the Implementation Date (and within five business days thereafter, dispatching to them an "uncertificated holding statement" relating to the number of MLB Shares issued to the addressee).
