 Whether those whom Dr Davis-Hurst represents are the holders of native title rights and interests in the Saltwater land is, as mentioned above, in dispute in proceedings in this Court. 9 On 12 December 2005 a delegate of the Native Title Registrar ('the Registrar') determined that, notwithstanding Mr Kemp's objection, the Agreement must be registered pursuant to s 24CL(1) of the Act.
 The critical issue to be determined in this proceeding is whether, nonetheless, the Agreement may not be registered unless he authorised its making. 16 Section 24CG(3)(b) of the Act required the application for registration of the Agreement to include a statement to the effect that the following requirements had been met: '(i) all reasonable efforts have been made ... to ensure that all persons who hold or may hold native title in relation to land or waters in the area covered by the agreement have been identified; (ii) all of the persons so identified have authorised the making of the agreement'. (emphasis added) A further statement was required which briefly set out the grounds on which the Registrar should be satisfied that the requirements were met.
 It is accepted on all sides that Mr Kemp is not a member of that group. 39 Counsel for Mr Kemp initially argued that, in the circumstances of this case, s 251A(b) required the claimant group represented by Dr Davis-Hurst and Mr Kemp, together to authorise the making of the agreement in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted by them.
 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 explained the failure to provide an objection procedure in the case of an area agreement on the basis that 'the appropriate response of potential native title holders unhappy about the registration of such an agreement is to make a native title claim' (par 22.23).
