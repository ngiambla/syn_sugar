 Whether those whom Dr Davis-Hurst represents are the holders of native title rights and interests in the Saltwater land is, as mentioned above, in dispute in proceedings in this Court. 9 On 12 December 2005 a delegate of the Native Title Registrar ('the Registrar') determined that, notwithstanding Mr Kemp's objection, the Agreement must be registered pursuant to s 24CL(1) of the Act.
 It is accepted on all sides that Mr Kemp is not a member of that group. 39 Counsel for Mr Kemp initially argued that, in the circumstances of this case, s 251A(b) required the claimant group represented by Dr Davis-Hurst and Mr Kemp, together to authorise the making of the agreement in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted by them.
 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 explained the failure to provide an objection procedure in the case of an area agreement on the basis that 'the appropriate response of potential native title holders unhappy about the registration of such an agreement is to make a native title claim' (par 22.23).
