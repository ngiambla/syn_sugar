 I stood the matter over to 4 August 2005. 6 On 4 August 2005 there was still no appearance from the respondents and the applicant indicated that it wished to file an application for default judgment. 7 On 24 August 2005, the matter was listed for hearing of the application for default judgment.
 However, at the hearing the respondents appeared by solicitors Messrs Gray and Perkins who filed a notice of appearance on that date. 8 Orders were made for the filing of a defence and a defence was filed on 29 September 2005. 9 At a directions hearing on 29 September 2005 I referred the matter to mediation and listed it for further directions on 24 November 2005.
 I subsequently vacated the directions hearing and relisted it for directions on 15 December 2005. 10 On 7 December 2005, Messrs Gray and Perkins filed a notice of ceasing to act supported by an affidavit of a partner of that firm. 11 At the directions hearing on 15 December 2005 there was no appearance by the respondents.
