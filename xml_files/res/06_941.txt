 The matters on which and the extent to which Mr Suter is likely to be questioned by the respondents would not militate against a grant of leave, if an entitlement were otherwise established. 3 Insofar as the matters to be taken into account under s 192(2) of the Evidence Act are relevant, none of them, in my view, would militate against a grant of leave in the present case.
 In determining whether leave should be granted under this paragraph, the issue is whether Mr Suter had, at an earlier point in time than his examination in chief, made a prior inconsistent statement, that is, whether he had made a previous representation that was inconsistent with the evidence given by him in his examination in chief.
 In the circumstances, I do not consider that, even if the statement did contain representations which were inconsistent with his evidence given in his examination in chief, the statement could be said to have been made by him within the meaning of s 38(1)(c). 27 This brings me to a consideration of the sound recordings of the interviews with Mr Suter that took place before lunch on 11 March and on 22 March 2004 and in respect of which typed transcripts have been made which, together with the compact disc containing copies of those two recorded interviews, comprise Exhibit AA2 on the current application on the voir dire. 28 The record of Mr Suter's interview with the inspectors before lunch on 11 March 2004 is replete with representations made by Mr Suter which are inconsistent with the evidence given by him in his examination in chief thus far.
