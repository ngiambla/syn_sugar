 EDMONDS J: 1 This application is an appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirming a decision of a delegate of the respondent refusing a claim for a pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ('the Act') on the basis that the applicant is not a 'veteran' as defined in the Act.
 The dates of those concert tours were given as: 1. 2 March 1967 to 16 March 1967. 2. 22 December 1967 to 3 January 1968. 3. 23 December 1969 to 12 January 1970. 4. 16 September 1979 to 6 October 1970. 4 It is clear from evidence before the Tribunal that the applicant was paid by the Australian Army for each of these tours and that occurred at the air base in Saigon at the end of each tour, although he received allowances through the Army while he was on tour. 5 The evidence also establishes that only one of the tours, the December 1969/January 1970 tour, was jointly sponsored by the Army and the Australian Forces Overseas Fund ('the AFOF'), but that while individual entertainers on the tour were sponsored by the AFOF, the Sydney ABC Dance Band, of which the applicant was a member, was sponsored on that tour by the Army.
 At [25] the Tribunal did address the issue of whether the applicant is a representative of the AFOF albeit in combination with the issue of whether, as such a representative, he provided welfare services to the defence force. 14 On the evidence referred to at [11] above, the Tribunal came to the view that the applicant is not such a 'representative' ([at 30]), and there is no basis for the view that such process of reasoning is infected by error of law. 15 The applicant, in his written submissions, contended that 'representatives' as it appears in the Determination should be given a meaning that protects those who were in fact in a war zone and thereby exposed to the risks and circumstances associated with that war.
