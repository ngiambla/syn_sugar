 EDMONDS J: 1 This application is an appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirming a decision of a delegate of the respondent refusing a claim for a pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ('the Act') on the basis that the applicant is not a 'veteran' as defined in the Act.
 At [25] the Tribunal did address the issue of whether the applicant is a representative of the AFOF albeit in combination with the issue of whether, as such a representative, he provided welfare services to the defence force. 14 On the evidence referred to at [11] above, the Tribunal came to the view that the applicant is not such a 'representative' ([at 30]), and there is no basis for the view that such process of reasoning is infected by error of law. 15 The applicant, in his written submissions, contended that 'representatives' as it appears in the Determination should be given a meaning that protects those who were in fact in a war zone and thereby exposed to the risks and circumstances associated with that war.
