 The third proposition is: (c) Mr Nipperess has degenerative spinal disease consistent with his age on a background of pre-existing kyphoscoliosis and does not have vertebral fractures. ' 10 The Tribunal rejected the first proposition on the basis that it was not supported by any of the medical evidence.
 That finding is not in dispute. 11 In respect of the second proposition, the Tribunal said: 'This proposition was put by Professor Sambrook and depended strongly on whether we accept that Mr Nipperess does in fact have multiple vertebral fractures and that they occurred during the relevant period of service. ' 12 The Tribunal then summarised the position as follows (at [31]): 'If we were to accept that Mr Nipperess does not have vertebral fractures, then Mr Nipperess' case fails in that there is no evidence to support the argument that he suffered any injury during the relevant period of service.
 Failing to consider all of the evidence misdirected [sic] itself when confining itself to determining an answer to the question of " whether a fit young man suffered asymptomatic multiple vertebral fractures and remained asymptomatic for 18 years was supported by the evidence" . 5.
 DID THE TRIBUNAL ERR IN DETERMINING A COMPRESSION FRACTURE COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD OF SERVICE? 43 The three medical experts who gave evidence at the Tribunal hearing disagreed whether it was possible for the applicant to have suffered a subclinical vertebral fracture during his period of service.
