 In reasons for judgment announced on 3 June 2004, the presiding judge, Handley JA, said this: 'The Court has heard Ms Samootin on her application for leave to appeal generally, and at greater length than would be allowed to a party who was legally represented.
 Ms Samootin was also unsuccessful in having the Court of Appeal stay the costs order. 8 Ms Samootin filed applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia against various decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, including that of 3 June 2004.
 He referred to the history of the litigation; in particular, the decision of the Court of Appeal upholding Palmer J's judgment, and McHugh J's comment about the absence of any prospect of success in obtaining special leave to appeal against it.
