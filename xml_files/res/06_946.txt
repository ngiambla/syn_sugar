 1 The applicant in this proceeding applies for an extension of time under s 44(2A) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) to appeal on a question of law from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal'). 2 On 2 November 2005, the Tribunal heard an application issued by the applicant for review of a decision made by the respondent on 15 December 2004.
 The applicant asked for a reconsideration of that determination under s 62 of the SRC Act. 16 On 15 December 2004, a delegate of the respondent advised the applicant that, on the reconsideration of the determination, it had been decided to affirm the decision. 17 Both decision-makers had regard to the opinions expressed by Professor Bruce Black in reports dated 11 October 1996 and 22 November 1996, respectively.
 Dr Barnett concluded that the applicant had a permanent loss of hearing attributed to his employment in the RAF and in the army in the order of 10.1 per cent, and that no permanent loss of hearing had occurred after 18 October 1982 that 'can be attributed by [sic] his employment in the RAF'.
 On my reasoning, and that of Burchett J in Brennan , where a change in a permanent impairment occurring after the commencement date is such that, quantitatively and qualitatively, it is properly to be characterised as a further or new impairment occurring after the commencing date it is compensable by a lump sum payment under ss 24 and 25.
