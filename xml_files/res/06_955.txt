 In this case the approved senior officer was satisfied that the circumstances brought the case within a "special circumstances" exception to the general rule (pars (b) and (c) of s 7A(2) of the Passports Act). 4 On or about 20 January 2005, the applicant, being dissatisfied with the decision to issue the passport, requested a review of the decision to issue it.
 It will be appreciated that by this time the child was residing in Australia with her mother. 5 On 7 October 2005, the delegate with the power to review the decision decided that the issue of the passport without the consent of both parents had been warranted. 6 On 1 November 2005 the applicant lodged his application with the Tribunal for review of the decision to issue the passport. 7 In March 2006 there was an interlocutory hearing before the Tribunal in which the representatives of the present respondents submitted that the proceeding was frivolous and vexatious and that the application should be dismissed under s 42B(1)(a) of the AAT Act .
 I think that they were. 16 The applicant has not been able to point to any utility in the proceeding before the Tribunal. 17 The applicant has known since the decision of the Tribunal on 18 April 2006 that the substance of the Tribunal's decision was that there was no remedy that the Tribunal could give consequential upon a determination that the passport had been obtained as a result of the alleged misrepresentations by his wife to the Department. 18 At the directions hearing before me on 21 June 2006, Mr Muston, counsel for the Minister, made it plain that the same point would be relied upon in the present hearing, that is to say, that he would seek to sustain the reasoning of the Tribunal. 19 Before me today, however, the applicant has not been able to suggest any order which it would have been within the power of the Tribunal to make which would flow from a finding that his wife had obtained the passport for his daughter as a result of the misrepresentations.
