 INTRODUCTION 1 The plaintiffs are voluntary administrators of Huon Corporation Pty Ltd (administrators appointed) ("the Company"), having been appointed by resolution of the Company's director on 30 June 2006. 2 The plaintiffs apply, first, for an order under s 439A(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") extending the convening period for the second meeting of creditors of the Company, and, secondly, for an order under s 447A of the Act permitting the committee of creditors to determine the plaintiffs' remuneration as administrators. 3 I think that the plaintiffs are proper plaintiffs in both respects.
 Paragraph 36 of Mr Pascoe's affidavit is as follows: "The Administrators are of the opinion that it is in the interests of the creditors of the Company that the convening period for the Second Meeting of Creditors be extended for a period of up to 90 days.
 The Administrators are currently uncertain whether they will be able to maintain the Company's business as a going concern. (b) The Administrators are also pursuing negotiations with key customers and stakeholders to ensure the stabilisation of the Company's current operations with a view to effecting a sale as a going concern. (c) The Administrators are pursuing a resolution of industrial action in order to maximise the chance of the business continuing as a going concern.
