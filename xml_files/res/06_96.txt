 A box marked "insufficiently addressed" was ticked. 6 The appellant did not attend the hearing and the RRT proceeded to make a decision on the review under section 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") without taking any further action to enable the appellant to appear before it. 7 The RRT was not satisfied on the evidence before it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution.
 It was entitled to proceed on the basis that the form had been sent to and received by the appellant's authorised agent. 24 The application for review by the RRT was filed after the provisions of s 422B came into force in July 2002; that section was therefore applicable: see SZBJW v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1356 at [4] .
 There may be some doubt as to the construction and effect of s 422B: see WAJR v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 106 at [57] ; see also Moradian v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 at [29] to [36]. 25 However, even if s 422B was not effective to exclude any operation of the common law fair hearing rule, on the facts of the present case there was nothing to give rise to an obligation of procedural fairness to contact the appellant's migration agent. 26 The appellant's adoption of the contents of his migration file in his application for review had the effect that the appellant gave that information for the purpose of his review application: see s 424A(3)(b).
