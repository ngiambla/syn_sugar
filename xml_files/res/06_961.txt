 He further deposes that: o on 29 June 2006 he purchased an infringing kicking tee at the first respondent's Browns Plains store, and was sold an unpackaged and unlabelled black rubber kicking tee by a male salesperson, who told Mr McColm, inter alia , that this kicking tee was 'ours and we call it a no name tee...
 The applicants further submit that the first respondent appears to both have and be selling large amounts of the infringing kicking tees, as (they claim) evidenced from comments of salespersons in the stores of the first respondent o the applicants submit that the respondents have deliberately and dishonestly continued to act in infringement of the applicants' Registered Design despite previous undertakings of the respondents. 22 Unfortunately the Court has not had the benefit of submissions from the respondents on these points.
 Balance of convenience 31 As I have already indicated, there is evidence that: o the respondents are selling infringing kicking tees which may infringe the applicants' registered design o there is a history of communication between these parties, including it appears undertakings by the respondents not to continue to sell kicking tees which infringe the applicants' Registered Design o the infringing kicking tees which the respondents are selling bear a very strong similarity to the applicants' kicking tees. 32 Again, it is unfortunate that the respondents did not appear today.
