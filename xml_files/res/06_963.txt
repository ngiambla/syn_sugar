 The substance of these paragraphs is an allegation that during the hearing, the applicant articulated a claim that he feared persecution on the basis that a political opinion relating to assumed connections with Pakistan would be imputed to him if he were returned to India.
 The applicant contended that this political opinion would be attributed to him simply because he has been absent from India for a very long period of time. 3 The applicant submits that this claim was completely distinct from the claim that he feared persecution as a result of imputed political opinion on account of activities in India.
 I am inclined to take the broader view that this is a distinct claim from the other claims which were made by the applicant. 6 It is necessary to consider whether the Tribunal failed to deal with or consider the claim as alleged.
