 1 Section 7(2) of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ('the Act') provides that, by reason of the inclusion of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ('the ABC') in Part II of Schedule 2 of the Act ('the Schedule'), the ABC is exempt from the operation of the Act ' in relation to the documents referred to in that Schedule in relation to [it]'.
 The ABC draws a distinction between documents related to its program material, which it says are exempt and documents related to its administrative function, which are outside the scope of the expression. 7 UTS submits that "in relation to" in the context of the Schedule equates to "for" and that the exemption is only for documents which are ABC program material.
 The Tribunal did accept, however, the reasoning in Keane that the Schedule is not limited to program material and held that it encompassed documents relating to program material in that it extended the exemption to ' matters such as the intellectual property of [the ABC] in a program ' (at [32]).
