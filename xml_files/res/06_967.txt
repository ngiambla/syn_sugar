 1 This is an application pursuant to which the applicant seeks an order that notices issued by the first respondent relying upon s 77C of the Bankruptcy Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') to produce documents and provide information, be set aside, and an order that the first respondent be enjoined from acting on the notices.
 In summary, para 3 of the notice required the recipient to provide a list of documents described in Sch 1 of the notice which the recipient once had, but no longer has, in his or her possession, custody or control, and the persons to whom those documents had been sent and when.
 There is also a requirement that the recipient verify by affidavit that the list is true and contains all of the documents falling within the categories in Sch 1 of the notice which the recipient had, but no longer has in his or her possession, custody or power. 47 Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that both the requirement to provide the list referred to therein, and the requirement that the list be verified by affidavit were invalid on the grounds that the imposition of these requirements were oppressive and unreasonable.
