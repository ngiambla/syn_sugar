 Section 32AB(2)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) gives the court power to transfer proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court, Order 82 rules 4 to 8 address the matters to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion to transfer proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court. 2 The court may transfer proceedings on its own initiative, see section 32AB(2)(b) and Order 82 rule 6.
 The primary considerations for the court in exercising its discretion are whether the Federal Magistrates Court has jurisdiction and whether the Federal Magistrates Court has the resources to hear and determine the proceedings and whether a transfer is in the interests of justice. 3 Although these proceedings were commenced in the Federal Court the applicant acknowledges that the proceedings should have been commenced in the Federal Magistrates Court.
 I am also satisfied that it is likely that the proceedings will be heard and determined at less cost and more convenience to the parties than if the proceedings were not transferred. 4 It is not clear whether the proceedings would be likely to be heard and determined earlier in the Federal Magistrates Court, than if the matter were to remain in my list; but I do not think that the proceedings would be heard significantly later.
 That of itself, seems to me to be decisive. 5 I am also satisfied that the Federal Magistrates Court has jurisdiction to hear the proceeding, see section 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act .
