 Section 32AB(2)(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) gives the court power to transfer proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court, Order 82 rules 4 to 8 address the matters to be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion to transfer proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court. 2 The court may transfer proceedings on its own initiative, see section 32AB(2)(b) and Order 82 rule 6.
 I am also satisfied that it is likely that the proceedings will be heard and determined at less cost and more convenience to the parties than if the proceedings were not transferred. 4 It is not clear whether the proceedings would be likely to be heard and determined earlier in the Federal Magistrates Court, than if the matter were to remain in my list; but I do not think that the proceedings would be heard significantly later.
