 It is sufficient to note that the ground of appeal identified in the notice of appeal filed on 25 November 2005 is that: The applicant was not afforded procedural fairness when the country information report submitted by the appellant was not considered.
 The application should have been decided based on matters prevailing AT THE TIME the decision is made. 2 The applicant for leave to appeal has not been able to draw my attention to any evidence which would provide a factual foundation for the assertion contained in the notice of appeal.
 To the extent that any material has been produced in the present proceedings which suggests that the Tribunal has not considered material furnished to it, it is material that post dates the hearing and decision of the Tribunal. 3 This appeal has no prospects of success and in those circumstances, leave is refused with costs.
