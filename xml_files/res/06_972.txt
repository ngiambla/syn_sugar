 By letter dated 25 May 2005, the Minister rejected that application. 6 On 25 October 2005, the applicant wife filed an application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.
 On 31 January 2006, the solicitors acting for the respondent wrote to the applicant enclosing a copy of the sealed orders of the Registrar and allowing her until 15 February 2006 to file her contentions.
 The only error on the part of McInnis FM that is alleged is his Honour's failure to adjourn the hearing of the application for judicial review so that the applicant wife could have more time to consider the respondent's contentions.
 The applicant wife's contentions of fact and law rely on the same matters as were set out in her initial application for a protection visa, and in her application for review in the Tribunal.
