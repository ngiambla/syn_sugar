 He was unwell, suffering from the illness which is the subject matter of the appeal. 2 In any event, counsel for the Repatriation Commission, the respondent to the appeal, made an application for costs.
 The matter was called on again this morning when the applicant appeared and made submissions why, in the circumstances of this appeal, costs should not follow the event. 3 The question of costs is always in the discretion of the Court.
 In other words, in the exercise of my discretion acting judicially, I can think of no reason why the Repatriation Commission should not be entitled to its costs and there must be an order accordingly. 8 However, I would ask those advising the Repatriation Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission these reasons so that the Commission might consider whether, having regard to the contribution Mr Sleep has made and to the consequences which he has suffered, it would be appropriate not to enforce the order.
