 1 On 21 December 2005 I delivered my reasons for an order which I made on that day dismissing the applicant's appeal against a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) given on 4 September 2004.
 The matter was called on again this morning when the applicant appeared and made submissions why, in the circumstances of this appeal, costs should not follow the event. 3 The question of costs is always in the discretion of the Court.
 This appeal arose out of the applicant's belief that the Commission had not recognised the seriousness of his disabilities and had thereby under-compensated him for a long period of time. 6 As I explained in my reasons, the question of the merits of the claim was for the Tribunal.
 In the end result, I found that the Tribunal had not made any error of law. 7 Whilst I have considerable sympathy for the applicant, there seems to me no reason why the usual rule should not take effect in this case.
 In other words, in the exercise of my discretion acting judicially, I can think of no reason why the Repatriation Commission should not be entitled to its costs and there must be an order accordingly. 8 However, I would ask those advising the Repatriation Commission to bring to the attention of the Commission these reasons so that the Commission might consider whether, having regard to the contribution Mr Sleep has made and to the consequences which he has suffered, it would be appropriate not to enforce the order.
