 It seemed to me that the third and fourth respondents had not seriously contested the summary judgment motion; and that this should be reflected in any costs order.
 Therefore, I find that costs should be apportioned amongst the respondents upon the basis the applicant has proposed. 14 As a starting point, I accept the evidence of Mr Merrick concerning the proportion of the costs attributable to each respondent.
