 INTRODUCTION 1 On 14 June 2006, I delivered reasons for judgment and ordered that there be summary judgment for the applicant against the respondents: Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 726 (" Nokia ").
 It seemed to me that the third and fourth respondents had not seriously contested the summary judgment motion; and that this should be reflected in any costs order.
 The fourth respondent claimed that he stopped selling Nokia branded products before this proceeding began and that, while he accepted that Nokia had a right to sue him, the case could have settled before it came to court.
 Therefore, I find that costs should be apportioned amongst the respondents upon the basis the applicant has proposed. 14 As a starting point, I accept the evidence of Mr Merrick concerning the proportion of the costs attributable to each respondent.
