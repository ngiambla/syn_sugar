 Mr Richardson's evidence is that a strata design was chosen for the building as it created "the highest potential valuation for the purposes of obtaining finance for its construction". 66 The design and construction were done by Multiplex under a Design, Construct and Finance Contract of 16 January 1997.
 Significantly in this context it was in June 1998 that a strata plan was prepared and lodged with the Titles Office for examination. 79 In the event then, I am satisfied that as at 30 June 1998 the Bulletin Place property was held for the purposes of sale in the ordinary course of business of the Hallinn Trust.
 For the reasons I have given above, I reject the latter of these contentions because I do not accept that the nature and character, and the connection of, the interest liability to the gaining of rental income were as the Deputy Commissioner has contended.
