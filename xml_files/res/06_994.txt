 See generally McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 828 at [82] --- [92] and [370] --- [382]. 4 The respondents have filed an application for leave to appeal from the judgment and leave is sought pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court Act 1976.
 Although an engaged consideration of the merits of that application is not part of this application for a stay, one aspect of the orthodoxy of the approach to considering the treatment of appeals is the recognition that an appeal does not lie either with or without leave from reasons for judgment but only from judgments, decrees and orders.
 That lack of opportunity to be heard is said to be compounded by a further hearing of the matter and thus the proceeding should be stayed pending the application for leave and the resolution of any appeal, should leave be given. 7 Counsel for the respondents will seek to establish the merits of the primary position in arguing the application for leave.
 I propose to make further directions in the conduct of the trial and they are that the respondents file in the Court and serve upon the applicant any further affidavit material upon which any of them intend to rely in relation to the determination of the question of whether a penalty ought to be imposed upon any of the respondents pursuant to s 298U(a) of the Act, by 4.00pm on Thursday, 17 August 2006.
