 The first is concerned to make the point that the information in the letters could not overcome the problems with the appellant's evidence (collected in the paragraphs immediately preceding that concerned with the letters), that led it to make the findings summarised at [11].
 The Magistrate correctly rejected the claim that the Tribunal had ignored or failed to take into account a relevant consideration. 16 On the hearing of the appeal the appellant was granted leave to amend the first ground of appeal so as to claim that "relevant material" had not been taken into account.
 It will be apparent from what I have said about the relevant considerations formulation that I do not accept that the Tribunal failed to take relevant material into account. 17 The appellant's counsel submitted that the Tribunal's obligation in relation to the letters was "to obtain either in a formal or informal way, some information about what was in there".
