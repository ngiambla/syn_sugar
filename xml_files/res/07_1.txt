 The applicant argued that, however broad an interpretation is given to the words 'arising out of', they still pose a test of causation which is not satisfied by merely temporal connections (of time and place). 26 The applicant submitted that the four factors relied upon by the Tribunal were simply contextual factors which helped explain the time and place at which the respondent sustained her injury.
 The respondent argued that, by this financial inducement to her, the RAAF thereby 'invited' or 'encouraged' her to take up the option, such that her case was not materially distinguishable from Danvers where a peripatetic railway worker was free, but it was not practicable, for him to reside other than in the railway van provided. 46 The respondent asserted that whilst living on base she was 'no doubt' subject to military discipline.
 The relevance of this to 'arising out of' is not especially clear. 50 Counsel pointed out that the legislature has expressly introduced a statutory concept of increased risk of injury where thought appropriate: s 6 excludes from the journey provisions, injuries on journeys by indirect routes 'that substantially increased the risk'.
 Among other things, some of the matters regarded by the High Court in Roncevich as relevant to the 'arising out of ... test' were not, it would seem, of any notable relevance to a restricted view of causation, such as that urged by the applicant, but were relevant to the less restrictive view I am inclined to favour.
