 The application before me concerns the trustee's decision in relation to an appeal and an application for leave to appeal filed and served by the bankrupt in August 2004. 5 It is necessary to say something about the appeal and the application for leave to appeal before proceeding further.
 The court is able to take into account information which was not available to the trustee at the time of an impugned act, omission or decision ( Gray v Clout (1990) 27 FCR 141, 144 per Pincus J). 4.
