 The application before me concerns the trustee's decision in relation to an appeal and an application for leave to appeal filed and served by the bankrupt in August 2004. 5 It is necessary to say something about the appeal and the application for leave to appeal before proceeding further.
 The respondents to the appeals (Mr Wilson and Ms Lawton) have applied to have the appeals dismissed on the ground that they have been abandoned (s 60(3) of the Act) or on the ground that there has been want of prosecution of the appeals; and 2.
 The impugned act, omission or decision of the trustee in bankruptcy need not be absurd, unreasonable, or taken in bad faith before it is subject to review or a resultant order of the court under the section ( Re Tyndall at 186 per Deane J).
 The court is able to take into account information which was not available to the trustee at the time of an impugned act, omission or decision ( Gray v Clout (1990) 27 FCR 141, 144 per Pincus J). 4.
