 Section 459A provides that, on an application such as that which is the subject of these proceedings, "the Court may order that an insolvent company be wound up in insolvency. " Section 459C(2)(a) empowers the Court to presume that a company is insolvent if the company has failed to comply with a statutory demand.
 It was argued that, should this ground not be accepted, then the defendant would, in the alternative, seek leave, pursuant to s 459S of the Corporations Act , to raise grounds it could have raised in an application to set aside the statutory demand.
 That is, a demand that professes or claims to be a statutory demand will be a statutory demand for the purposes of the Corporations Law: see Kalamunda [ Meat Wholesalers Pty Ltd v Reg Russell Sons Pty Ltd (1994) 51 FCR 446 at] 452.
 Nevertheless, there may be a case where a document that professes to be a statutory demand contains such a serious deficiency that it is impossible to treat the document as a statutory demand no matter what it professes to be: Topfelt [ Pty Ltd v State Bank of New South Wales Ltd (1993) 47 FCR 226 at] 238; Kalamunda at FCR 452.
