 Regulation 1.24 in that division requires statutory declarations to be provided in respect of certain evidence. 2 Regulation 1.21 in Div 1.5 relevantly provides: ' (1) In this Division: ... statutory declaration means a statutory declaration under the Statutory Declarations Act 1959 ' ('the 1.21 definition').
 The appellant does not suggest any such contrary intention. 11 The appellant draws a distinction between a statutory declaration " made under" the Commonwealth Act and a statutory declaration "under" the Commonwealth Act, the latter being prescribed by reg 1.21.
 The appellant argues that a "statutory declaration" in Div 1.5 is not confined to statutory declarations made under the Commonwealth Act and ought to be interpreted as including all statutory declarations sworn under any Act of a Parliament, provided that the declaration contains the information as required by the Regulations.
