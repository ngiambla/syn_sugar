 The Tribunal observed that he had failed to make such a claim in his original visa application. 8 The Tribunal also referred to a discrepancy in the appellant's visa application and his evidence as to the events of 17 May 2005.
 The Federal Magistrate 10 In his amended application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant alleged that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by relying in its reasons on inconsistent statements he made in his written statement which formed part of his visa application - without providing the appellant with particulars in writing of that information. 11 The Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, found that the appellant "republished by reference and reliance, and otherwise adopted the statement given in support of the visa application in its entirety by the letter and statement of 6 March 2006; and, in the absence of any other statement, he 'gave' the information to the Tribunal during the hearing by relying upon it as 'correct' ". 12 The Federal Magistrate held that the inconsistent statement in the visa application, referred to by the Tribunal in its reasons, came within the exemption provided by s 424A(3)(b) of the Act.
