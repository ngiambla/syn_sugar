 The application was for pecuniary penalties, injunctions and others orders pursuant to ss 76, 80 and 86C of the TP Act and of the Competition Policy Reform (Western Australia) Act 1996 together with declaratory relief pursuant to s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 The ACCC says that Study Overseas Now was also a party to the conduct which is the subject of the proceedings. 3 On 7 December 2005 Patricia Yeo, in her capacity as a director of Study Overseas Now, lodged an application with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) under s 601AA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for voluntary deregistration of the company.
 The ACCC has been unable to contact them. 6 At a directions hearing on 15 May 2007 the two former directors Belinda and Patricia Yeo were given leave to appear in the proceedings and to file and serve any affidavits in opposition to the application for reinstatement by 5 June 2007.
 The former officers of the company then before the Court accepted that the ACCC had standing to apply as did his Honour. 10 In relation to standing, the present case is relevantly indistinguishable from that before Austin J.
