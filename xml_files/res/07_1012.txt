 On 7 June 2007 in response to CMLA's claim for interlocutory relief, I made an order pursuant to subs 191(5) of the Act that the need for compliance with para (c) of subs 191(2) of the Act, in so far as it requires an approved summary of the Scheme to be given to owners of policies issued by CMLA referrable to CMLA's SF3, be dispensed with.
 In short, the Scheme does not prejudice, or materially affect, CMLA's policyholders referrable to SF3. (4) The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ('APRA') has indicated that it has no objection to the dispensation relief sought by the applicants, and has no objection to the Scheme itself. (5) The applicants have widely advertised the proposed Scheme and the intended confirmation application in newspapers throughout Australia.
 The independent actuary, Mr Aaron, has considered the impact of the Scheme on the security and benefit expectations of policyholders and has concluded that: (1) The benefit expectations of CIHL and CMLA policyholders will not be adversely affected by the Scheme; and (2) the Scheme should not materially affect the security of CIHL and CMLA policyholders.
