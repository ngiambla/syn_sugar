 1 I have before me an application brought under s 1322 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act ) by the liquidator of two companies, Hicom International Pty Ltd (Hicom International) and Hicom Sales Pty Ltd (Hicom Sales).
 On that day, Messrs King and Rowe signed a declaration of solvency showing that Hicom International had assets consisting of cash at bank of $22,850, and no liabilities, other than estimated expenses of winding up in the sum of $22,850.
 Thus there was a failure to satisfy the requirements of 494(3)(a) and (b), in that the declaration was not made before the date on which the notices of the meeting were sent and it was not lodged with the Commission before the date on which the notices of meeting went sent. 8 While there is provision in s 494(3)(b) for the Commission to extend the time for lodgement, there is no provision for the Commission to remedy a failure to comply with s 494(3) , insofar as that provision requires that the declaration be made before the date on which notices of the meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed are sent out.
 While there may not be serious consequences if the windings up are to be treated as creditors' voluntary windings up, one can understand that the directors may have some residual concern that the records would show that they were directors of companies that were wound up as creditors' voluntary windings up rather than members' voluntary windings up.
