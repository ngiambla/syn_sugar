 In this regard it seems essential to appreciate that the Guardianship and Administration Act is intended to provide for the guardianship of adults who need assistance in their personal affairs, for the administration of the estates of person who need assistance in their financial affairs ... and to make provision for a power of attorney to operate after the donor has ceased to have legal capacity, and for connected purposes (see the long title to the Act).
 By s 50(1) the administrator is empowered to sign and do all such things as are necessary to give effect to any power or duty vested in the administrator. [16] Section 52(1) provides that where an administration order has been made the represented person, until revocation of that order, "is to the extent that the represented person's estate is under the control of the administrator, deemed incapable of dealing with, transferring, alienating or charging her or his money or property or any part thereof or becoming liable under any contract without the order of the Tribunal or the written consent of the administrator".
 In dismissing the application Hayne J on behalf of himself and Crennan J said that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal. 20 In David by Her Tutor the Protective Commissioner v David (1993) 30 NSWLR 417 consideration was given to the effect of an order committing the management of an estate of a protected person to the Protective Commissions under the Protected Estates Act 1983 (NSW).
 The matter was adjourned until 8 August 2006. 33 The following day Mr Devaney sent a letter to the applicant's administrator, Mr Haddad, advising him of what had had happened in the proceedings and requesting him to contact Mr Devaney. 34 On 8 August 2006 Mr Devaney again appeared on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner in the Federal Magistrates Court before the District Registrar.
