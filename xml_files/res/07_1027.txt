 The Tribunal's determination in respect of s 237(b) of the Act 5 The issue in this appeal relates only to the Tribunal's decision in respect of s 237(b) of the Act, namely, that it was not likely that there would be interference with a site of particular significance to the native title party.
 This reluctance is evident from the Tribunal's reasons referred to at [6] above and, in particular, the distinction drawn by the Tribunal in its reasons referred to at [9] above, between the fact that the evidence of Mr Slim Parker and others was, because of the sensitivity of the site, confidential, whereas the information in the BHP handbook was "publicly available".
 Suffice to say that the Barimunya site is a very special traditional place for the native title party. 21 I am of the view, for the following reasons, that, in its application of the predictive assessment, the Tribunal took into account that even walking on the site in the absence of senior members would constitute interference with the site. 22 Firstly, the Tribunal referred expressly to the BHP "Aboriginal Heritage Induction Handbook" on the basis that it was "publicly available" information about the site, and chose to quote verbatim from that part of the handbook which referred to the site being "fenced off and marked with signs marking the Designated Area status".
