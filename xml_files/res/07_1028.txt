 These are those reasons. 2 On 28 May 2007, the eleventh respondents David Joseph Hayes, Scott Bradley Kershaw, Colin McIntosh Nicol and Murray Campbell Smith, were appointed the joint and several administrators ("the EPG Administrators") of a number of companies in what was known as the Estate Property Group ("EPG"), the parent of which is Estate Property Group Limited, by the directors of those companies.
 On 4 June 2007 the second applicants, Philip Patrick Carter and Gregory Winfield Hall, were appointed joint and several administrators of ACR in lieu of the previous administrators at a meeting of creditors of ACR ("the ACR Administrators"). 3 ACR raised funds from the public under a series of prospectuses by issuing debentures to investors ("Noteholders") either by way of new subscription or the roll over of existing debentures on maturity.
 Often, additional finances were obtained by the SPV from third party lenders, particularly to fund construction work secured either by a company charge or real property mortgage or mortgages with ACR subordinating its mortgage to the securities in favour of those lenders. 4 Permanent Nominees (Australia) Limited acted as trustee for the Noteholders for the purposes of certain of the prospectuses.
 That could well have been detrimental to the ultimate best interests of the creditors of ACR including the Noteholders. 12 The ACR Administrators did consider an alternative course, namely, to seek to enter a deed or some other form of agreement with the EPG Administrators under which they would give consent under s 440B(a) to ACR enforcing its securities after the "decision period" had expired.
