 On 4 June 2007 the second applicants, Philip Patrick Carter and Gregory Winfield Hall, were appointed joint and several administrators of ACR in lieu of the previous administrators at a meeting of creditors of ACR ("the ACR Administrators"). 3 ACR raised funds from the public under a series of prospectuses by issuing debentures to investors ("Noteholders") either by way of new subscription or the roll over of existing debentures on maturity.
 Often, additional finances were obtained by the SPV from third party lenders, particularly to fund construction work secured either by a company charge or real property mortgage or mortgages with ACR subordinating its mortgage to the securities in favour of those lenders. 4 Permanent Nominees (Australia) Limited acted as trustee for the Noteholders for the purposes of certain of the prospectuses.
