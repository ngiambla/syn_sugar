 1 By a motion filed on 21 June 2007 the second respondent, Hog's Breath Caf (Australia) Pty Ltd seeks an order that the applicant provide security for its costs of the proceedings up to and including the first day of trial in the amount of $60,000 or such other amount as the Court deems fit.
 On that date however the proceedings were stayed on account of the applicant's failure to comply with the order for security in relation to the other respondents which had been made on 30 January 2007. 4 In the event, the security order in relation to the other respondents was not complied with until shortly after 10 April 2007.
 An extension of time for the filing of the substituted statement of claim was allowed retrospectively. 5 At the directions hearing on 24 April 2007 orders were made including an order that the second respondent file and serve any motion for security for costs by 29 May 2007 in order to enable the parties to confer with respect to the question of security in the meantime. 6 Communications and correspondence ensued.
