 On the evidence, the Tribunal could not be satisfied of the appellant's claims and did not accept that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution. 5 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates' Court.
 The appellant also raised claims that the Tribunal had breached s 424A of the Act because the contents of the Tribunal's telephone conversation with the migration agent were not put to him for comment.
