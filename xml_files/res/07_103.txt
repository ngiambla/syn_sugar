 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate, given on 27 September 2006, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") made on 13 April 2005 and handed down on 5 May 2005.
 On the evidence, the Tribunal could not be satisfied of the appellant's claims and did not accept that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution. 5 The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates' Court.
 The appellant also raised claims that the Tribunal had breached s 424A of the Act because the contents of the Tribunal's telephone conversation with the migration agent were not put to him for comment.
 He noted that the appellant was seeking to take advantage of his failure to comply with the instructions contained in Section D of the form on which he applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision.
