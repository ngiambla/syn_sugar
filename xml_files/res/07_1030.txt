 The third respondent (Mr Yii), the sole director of Newpage, caused the payments to be made. 6 The conflicting accounts given by Mr Parsons and Mr Yii of the circumstances surrounding the making of the two payments and subsequent events were outlined in my reasons for judgment of 4 April 2007 referred to above.
 Accordingly, claims by liquidators to recover amounts paid away by the company under voidable transactions have been held to lie outside the predecessor provision of s 477(2A), namely, s 477(2A) of the Corporations Law : Luxtrend [1997] 2 Qd R 86 ; Nambucca Investments Pty Ltd v Snoco Ltd [1999] NSWSC 211 at [2] .
 There is no present liability under such a claim --- a liability would come into existence only if and when the Court made an order under s 588FF if Mr Hamilton applied for the order and proved that the payments constituted a voidable transaction. 26 In HIH [2004] NSWSC 5 at [12] and QBE Workers Compensation (NSW) Ltd v GJ Formwork Pty Ltd (2006) 56 ACSR 687 ( QBE ) at [4]-[5], Barrett J said that where there is room for argument about whether a claim is one of a debt to the company, the court should err on the side of treating the claim as a debt rather than decline to grant approval under s 477(2A).
 In Tietyens 31 ACSR 1, Weinberg J held that he lacked jurisdiction under s 477(2A) but gave directions under s 479(3). 38 For reasons that appear below, it is not necessary (and it is not desirable) that I attempt to define the concept of "a debt to the company" as that expression appears in s 477(2A).
