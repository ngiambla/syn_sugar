 Order 35 r 7(2) is not applicable in these circumstances because the Court is exercising its appellate jurisdiction. 7 No submissions have been made this morning as to whether my judgment or order of 13 June 2007 have been entered.
 Considering the situation on the best case of the appellant, however, comments of Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in De L v Director-General, NSW Department of Community Services [1997] HCA 14 ; (1997) 190 CLR 207 are relevant. 8 In that case, their Honours said at 215 as follows (omitting citations): The power of this court to reopen its judgments or orders is not in doubt.
 The court may do so if it is convinced that, in its earlier consideration of the point, it has proceeded "on a misapprehension as to the facts or law", where "there is some matter calling for review" or where "the interests of justice so require".
