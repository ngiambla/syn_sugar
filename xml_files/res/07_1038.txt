 The second respondent is entitled to know the identity of its directors or officers whose state of mind is to be attributed to it. 2 The evidence closed on 20 June 2007 after 45 days of hearing spread over 4 months commencing on 15 March 2007.
 This is said to be on the basis of evidence given by Mr Gorn who was one of the last witnesses in the case. 3 The University says that on the basis of that evidence and various documentary materials the Court should allow it to have resort to his state of mind as part of the basis upon which the pleaded state of mind of Sirtex is supported in its closing submissions.
 The oral evidence which was specifically referred to in submissions, and I don't say that that was exhaustive, resulted from inferential statements about the interpretation and rationality of things that happened which were put to Mr Gorn and to which he assented.
