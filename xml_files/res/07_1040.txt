 For example, it contended that it was open to the Court on the evidence already adduced to infer that the settlement was reasonable, and, alternatively it contended that the onus lay on CGU to prove that the settlement was not reasonable.
 It also argued that if it was necessary to call evidence then it was entitled to do so because it had not closed its case on the issue of the reasonableness of the settlement agreement.
 On the contrary, the evidence relied upon by CCAS itself established that the settlement as to costs was not reasonable because it included an obligation to pay the costs of the applicants of suing AIMS and that liability was not one against which CGU was bound to indemnify CCAS.
 Indeed, prior to the evidence of the quantum of the costs of the applicants suing the respondents other than AIMS, counsel for CCAS urged the Court to conclude that those costs were insignificant.
