 Written submissions have now been made about that issue. 2 The respondent seeks its costs in relation to both the notice of motion dealt with in the earlier judgment and of the proceedings as a whole.
 It submits, in relation to each, that costs should follow the event. 3 Although the respondent's submissions made a formal distinction between the costs of the notice of motion and the costs of the proceedings as a whole in my view it is not necessary to give them separate consideration.
 There are no features of the proceedings, or the notice of motion, which require that individual attention be given to each of them. 4 In the ordinary course the respondent is entitled to its costs unless there was some particular feature of the proceedings which suggests that the Court's discretion should be exercised in a different way.
