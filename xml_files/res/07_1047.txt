 It was due for completion in or about December 2004. 11 September---19 October 2003 --- Dealings between Union and LGB 24 On 11 September 2003 Mr Oscar Picciau was in charge of the site pending the employment of a project manager.
 On 11 September 2003 he was at the site with two LGB employees, Mr Angele Srbinovski and Mr David Hill, and a demolition and excavation contractor, Mr Bruce Harris from BBI Constructions.
 He says that he met with Primmer, Lane, Kelly and Fisher and that he was told to use contractors recommended by the Union and, if not, there would be stoppages.
 The evidence as to what Lane, Primmer and Kelly said to LGB employees, consistently with the evidence of Antonio Silvestri, was that this was not an isolated instance of pursuit of Antonio Silvestri by the Union.
