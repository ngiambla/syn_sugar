 The applicant acknowledged that the proceeding had been commenced out of time but asserted that it was not vexatious or an abuse of process and that it was capable of being reviewed by the Court. 5 The respondent filed an application in the proceeding under r 13 of the Federal Magistrates' Court Rules 2001 (Cth) ("the Rules ") seeking summary dismissal of the application on various grounds.
 I asked that steps be taken to advise the applicant of the adjourned hearing date and that, on that date, I proposed to hear any further argument which the applicant may wish to advance in the light of the material contained in the affidavit and then to proceed to determine the application. 14 The applicant attended the adjourned hearing on 16 February 2007.
