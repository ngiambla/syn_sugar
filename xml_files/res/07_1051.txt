 Specifically, the appellant states in his notice of appeal: "While the court has not dismissed my complaint of discrimination against the second respondent, it appears perhaps by virtue of my lack of clarity, to have missed important elements of it. " 15 The notice of appeal then contains several pages of submissions in relation to the issue of alleged sex discrimination by the second respondent (paras 7-12).
 However evaluating comprehensive arguments and evidence of the parties to determine whether the conduct of the first respondent did constitute sexual harassment and if so, whether the second respondent could be liable for the conduct of the first respondent (an issue not canvassed by his Honour other than to formulate his reasons on the assumption that the first respondent was an employee of the second respondent at all material times) would require a full hearing of the matter.
 Accordingly, in my view the learned Federal Magistrate should not have summarily dismissed the applicant's claim against the second respondent in respect of Pt II Div 3 SD Act , to the extent that no facts were alleged that would or could amount to sexual harassment by the first respondent of the appellant. 26 The matter should be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court to be heard in full by his Honour and determined on the submissions of the parties at trial.
