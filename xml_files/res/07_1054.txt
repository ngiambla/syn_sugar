 The unchallenged evidence is that the Njamal people, including those named as the current applicant-current claim group and their advisors, have always understood that the correct claim group was to be the larger group of Njamal people.
 At such meetings of the larger Njamal community decisions have been made to form a working group to deal with day to day claim group business and to participate in surveys in Njamal country.
 Where there is not a reasonably representative group of people at a community meeting or insufficient attendees, the persons present may decide that it is inappropriate for a decision to be made at that meeting.
