 The Authorised Dealer would only become entitled to the balance of the Deferred Settlement Account after the subtraction of certain amounts owing to TAPL by the Authorised Dealer. 8 The AD Program was successful in achieving significant growth in sales of monitored security lines.
 The number of Customer Service Agreements that TAPL purchased from Authorised Dealers in each year from its inception to 30 September 2003 was as follows: Year of Income Customer Service Agreements Purchased 30/9/1999 2,079 30/9/2000 40,598 30/9/2001 65,012 30/9/2002 55,293 30/9/2003 21,325 Total 184,307 9 The background to the establishment of the AD Program was as follows.
 In or about 1 October 1998, ADT Security Pty Ltd transferred certain business assets and licensed other assets to TAPL, so that TAPL began to carry on the business of ADT. 10 TAPL used the security monitoring infrastructure acquired from Honeywell, which included a security monitoring centre at Artarmon, to expand into security line monitoring for residential customers.
 TAPL's training program included training salespersons in door-to-door selling techniques. 18 There were a significant number of cancellations of Customer Service Agreements within the first 12 months, which resulted in the Authorised Dealers being liable under the Authorised Dealer Agreements to refund the Assignment Fees for the cancelled contracts.
 In practice, instead of insisting on a refund, TAPL permitted Authorised Dealers to offset the value of new contracts against their obligation to refund payments for cancelled contracts. 19 Even where fees for cancelled contracts were greater than fees payable for new contracts, TAPL was often unsuccessful in recovering amounts owing by Authorised Dealers.
 TAPL organised annual conferences to which all dealers were invited and rewarded the most successful Authorised Dealers with bonuses and prizes. 21 The AD Program was at its peak in 2001, when TAPL purchased over 65,000 contracts; but during 2002 a significant change occurred.
 Tyco US decided to downsize the AD Program in the United States and throughout the world. 22 As a result of this decision, TAPL terminated Authorised Dealer Agreements with about half of its dealers in 2002, which damaged the morale of the remaining Authorised Dealers.
 The discretion of TAPL to refuse to accept assignments was informed by certain factors: whether the customer was already, or had been, a customer, the financial capacity of the customer and compliance by the Authorised Dealer with the Operation Manual, the Installation Specification and the Authorised Dealer Agreement: cll 2.6 and 2.7 of the first version.
 The Operating Manual covered a number of matters, including the nature of the customers to be sought (small commercial and residential, rather than large commercial or governmental), the standard of service to be provided to customers, training, marketing, standards and procedures, pricing and installation.
 The advantage sought by each payment was the winning of a customer, so that he, she or it might be retained and exploited (using that word in a neutral sense) for future revenue for services to be provided. 77 The Assignment Fee was set so attractively that TAPL obtained, very quickly, more customers than anticipated.
