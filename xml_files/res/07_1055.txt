 TAPL organised annual conferences to which all dealers were invited and rewarded the most successful Authorised Dealers with bonuses and prizes. 21 The AD Program was at its peak in 2001, when TAPL purchased over 65,000 contracts; but during 2002 a significant change occurred.
 Tyco US decided to downsize the AD Program in the United States and throughout the world. 22 As a result of this decision, TAPL terminated Authorised Dealer Agreements with about half of its dealers in 2002, which damaged the morale of the remaining Authorised Dealers.
 That a very attractive (to the Authorised Dealer) Assignment Fee was set reflected the anticipation not of the value of the contract rights themselves that were assigned, but rather the future value of the connection with the customer and the future revenue stream once the customer was won.
