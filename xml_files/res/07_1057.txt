 This is whether this Court has jurisdiction under the Act to make a determination of native title in favour of a person or group of persons that has not made a native title determination application under s 61 of the Act in relation to the area in question but who is a respondent to such an application brought on behalf of another claimant group to which that respondent does not belong.
 The State's contention is that a native title determination can only be made in accordance with the provisions of the NT Act and, in particular, sections 10, 13, 61 at 225 --- hence the above question must be answered in the negative. 2 The motion is opposed by the person against whom it is directed, Mark McKenzie, by the relevant representative body, the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc ("the ALRM") and by the Commonwealth.
 The [1998] Amending NTA introduced, in the amended s 61(1), a requirement that an application must be authorised by the native title claim group. 1171 'Proper authorisation is the foundation for the institution and maintenance of a native title claimant application under s 61 of the new Act': Perry and Lloyd, Australian Native Title Law (Thomson Lawbook Co, 2003) at [3.140] p 439.
