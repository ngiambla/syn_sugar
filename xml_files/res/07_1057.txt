 This is whether this Court has jurisdiction under the Act to make a determination of native title in favour of a person or group of persons that has not made a native title determination application under s 61 of the Act in relation to the area in question but who is a respondent to such an application brought on behalf of another claimant group to which that respondent does not belong.
 It is not confined to describing which claimant applicant (if any) has succeeded in making out native title rights. 17 The making of an application under Part 3 of the Act which is permitted by s 13(1)(a) has, since the 1998 Amendment to the NT Act, been subjected to significant procedural and substantive requirements.
 In Western Australia v Ward (FC) at [219] Beaumont and von Doussa JJ indicated that, notwithstanding the "either --- or" character of the s 225 definition, it was open to a trial judge as a matter of discretion to decide that the Court should decline the jurisdiction to make a negative determination if the interests of justice so required.
