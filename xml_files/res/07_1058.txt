 Peach's view that the proposed relationship between benzene exposure and the subsequent development of myelofibrosis is based on epidemiological studies and individual case reports, such a correlation does not necessarily exclude a definitive causal connection. 31 As I have indicated, the Tondel article was merely an example of one reference material relied upon by Dr Collins.
 It accepted that the contents of the report of Dr Collins, the survey material from Sweden referred to in the report of Tondel, the United Kingdom survey referred to by Professor Peach, and the bundle of documents produced by the respondent supported or pointed to a reasonable hypothesis connecting the service of the veteran and his exposure to benzene to his subsequent death from myelofibrosis.
 The other was to show the connection between benzene and myelofibrosis was "more than a possibility", which was a critical issue. 59 It may be said that in view of Dr Collins' evidence and the other material referred to by the Tribunal supporting the relevant connection, the acceptance or otherwise of Professor Peach's evidence has immaterial.
