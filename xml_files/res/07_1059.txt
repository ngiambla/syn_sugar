 The second claim, which I will call the 'Charlotte Management Unit claim', concerns a period of 9 days in September 2001 in which Mr Rainsford was held in a cell in the Spine area of the Charlotte Management Unit at Port Phillip Prison.
 I find that had it been necessary for his health, Mr Rainsford need not have been placed in the Spine area, but that there was no medical evidence expressly stating that he should not be placed there.
 There is little doubt that GSL provides a service to the State: there was in evidence parts of the Prison Services Agreement between the State and ACF and further evidence that ACF sub-contracted its obligations to GSL.
