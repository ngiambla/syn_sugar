 The Master Agreement provided for News to bid for and acquire the AFL broadcasting rights and then to sub-license the AFL pay television rights to Foxtel and the AFL free-to-air rights to Nine and Network Ten Pty Ltd (' Ten '), another free-to-air channel, on previously agreed terms.
 Its channels have included ' Fox Sports 1 ', ' Fox Sports 2 ', ' NRL on Optus ', ' Fuel ' (action sports and ' extreme lifestyle activities ') and the ' How to Channel ' (home renovations and lifestyle issues).
 They each said that the decision not to bid was prompted by the view that, although AFL content was attractive, Fox Sports should focus on acquiring the NRL pay television rights, especially as Austar was entitled to terminate the Fox Sports-Austar CSA if Fox Sports lost those rights.
