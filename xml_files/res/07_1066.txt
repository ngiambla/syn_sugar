 INTRODUCTION 1 On 14 May 2004, a document entitled 'Heads of Agreement' ("HofA") was executed by the applicant (which traded as Latitude Development Group) ("Latitude") and its principal director, Mr Josh Thompson ("Thompson"), and the BreakFree interests - BreakFree Resorts (Victoria) Pty Ltd ("BreakFree Resorts") and its parent, BreakFree Limited (collectively "BreakFree").
 However, on 31 August 2004, BreakFree ultimately sought to 'break free' from Latitude in relation to the development and construction of the Erskine on the Beach Project by purporting to terminate the HofA on the basis that a condition precedent in the HofA had not been satisfied.
 If Latitude is satisfied with its enquiries, or it does not take steps to notify BreakFree by this date that it is not satisfied with its enquiries and that it no longer wishes to proceed with the transaction, Latitude will be bound under the [HofA] to purchase the development rights for the apartments.
 First, that part of the conversation was not included in a subsequent email prepared by Thompson and sent to his solicitor on 30 August 2004 recording the details of conversations with Frawley on 27 and 30 August 2004 or in his initial witness statement.
 This section will analyse the validity of the parties' various arguments and conclude that BreakFree's conduct in terminating the HofA by letter dated 31 August 2004 (see [95] above) was repudiatory conduct and that Latitude's response on 22 September 2004 (see [99] above) constituted lawful acceptance of that repudiation.
 This requirement was described as a warranty and not a condition precedent and did not (in light of cl 9.2.3) constitute an undertaking by BreakFree that the contract was conditional on the collection of all deposits by it.
 The termination letter on 31 August 2004 demonstrated an intention by BreakFree to use its own contractual breach to avoid completion of the HofA or any 'new' or long-form contract in existence at that time. (2) WAS BREAKFREE ENTITLED TO TERMINATE THE HOFA ON SOME OTHER BASIS? 114 BreakFree sought to rely on other conduct of Latitude as a basis for termination.
 Clause 3.3 of the HofA provides that: "[e]ach party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these [HofA] are given full effect. " 122 It is a composite clause.
 It appears to involve two concepts - " negotiations in good faith " - but directed at a particular end - "to ensure that the terms set out in these [HofA] are given full effect. " The phrase " negotiations in good faith " is not a defined term.
 At the time of the negotiations of the terms of the HofA, negotiations for Stages 3 and 3A were sufficiently advanced to support the assertion in cl 3.1 that " [BreakFree and Latitude] have reached finality in agreeing to the terms set out in the HofA ".
