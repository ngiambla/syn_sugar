 INTRODUCTION 1 On 14 May 2004, a document entitled 'Heads of Agreement' ("HofA") was executed by the applicant (which traded as Latitude Development Group) ("Latitude") and its principal director, Mr Josh Thompson ("Thompson"), and the BreakFree interests - BreakFree Resorts (Victoria) Pty Ltd ("BreakFree Resorts") and its parent, BreakFree Limited (collectively "BreakFree").
 However, on 31 August 2004, BreakFree ultimately sought to 'break free' from Latitude in relation to the development and construction of the Erskine on the Beach Project by purporting to terminate the HofA on the basis that a condition precedent in the HofA had not been satisfied.
 This requirement was described as a warranty and not a condition precedent and did not (in light of cl 9.2.3) constitute an undertaking by BreakFree that the contract was conditional on the collection of all deposits by it.
 Clause 3.3 of the HofA provides that: "[e]ach party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these [HofA] are given full effect. " 122 It is a composite clause.
