 The basis of this order appears to be that no reasonable cause of action under the TP Act is disclosed, the Statement of Claim is otherwise defective and the proceedings has been brought in the Federal Court to avoid both the orders of Bleby J and Mr Kowalski's disagreement with the State Supreme Court over waiver of fees.
 MMA Super's APRA return for 2006 indicates it was wound up as a superannuation entity on the date of the above transfer. 12 Mr Kowalski in the application seeks an order that MMA Super pay him "his correct statutory and legally entitled Total and Permanent Disablement Benefit plus compound interest since 16 March 1994 in the sum of about $280,000.00".
 In consideration of the matters set out in para 1 and para 2 above, Kowalski and his dependants agree: 4.1 Not to institute any legal proceedings and or legal complaints with any Court, Tribunal or body in respect of the matters set out in paragraph 1 ..." 18 MMAL Super, though not a party to the agreement, made the payment referred to in cl 2.1 of the agreement above.
 In aid of this contention MMA Super seeks comfort in the brief observation made by the Court in Kowalski FC (at [22]) to the effect that in that case no claim within jurisdiction could be made against MMA Super "as, for example, under the Trade Practices Act ". 30 The question so raised is not whether a s 52 claim is doomed to failure (I leave out of consideration the question raised by MMA Super as to whether the s 52 could be applicable in any event to a superannuation trustee given s 51AF of the TP Act and the provisions of Pt 2 Div 2 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth)).
