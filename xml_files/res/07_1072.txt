 That undertaking and that inquiry may be quite a wide one and the boundary of what is evidence of relevance to that inquiry and the making of orders, consequent upon such inquiry, can be seen to be much wider than the admissibility of evidence as probative and in conformity with the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) in a professional negligence case.
 Nevertheless, the debate that took place before me was of assistance in reaching my conclusion on either basis; that is, the basis of a professional negligence action and a wider s 178 action. 3 Without going through the affidavits in detail, they contain evidence which can be summarised as evidence in which Mr Hamilton says what a prudent trustee would have done and evidence as to what he would have done.
 There is a body of authority, best illustrated by the judgment of Austin J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vines (2006) 58 ACSR 298 which rejects evidence in professional negligence cases where the expert evidence does not direct itself to the developed practice amongst competent professionals.
 If what Mr Hamilton is seeking to say is that in his view no competent professional could ever have taken the steps that were taken by Mr Thomas, the evidence may not be admissible on those authorities by reference to the test of admissibility in a professional negligence case.
