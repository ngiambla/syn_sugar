 It is not disputed that a period of 146 weeks commencing on that date expires on 15 February 2008. 30 Mr Clark, on the other hand, submits that upon its proper construction, subs (1) of s 1170 applies only where a person receives and retains the benefit of both the periodic compensation payments and a lump sum compensation payment.
 Accordingly, Mr Clark submits, subs (1) does not apply and the applicable provision within s 1170 is subs (3). (It was not suggested by either party that subs (2) applies. ) According to subs (3), the lump sum preclusion period began on the day on which Mr Clark's loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity began, namely 31 October 2000.
 Her Honour thought that that situation would not often arise and set those cases apart from the usual. 69 In Chamberlain [2002] FCA 67 ; 116 FCR 348 itself, the effect of the statutory formula was that the applicant would have to pay back more than twice the amount that had been allocated to loss of earnings and of earning capacity in her lump sum settlement.
