 It is not disputed that a period of 146 weeks commencing on that date expires on 15 February 2008. 30 Mr Clark, on the other hand, submits that upon its proper construction, subs (1) of s 1170 applies only where a person receives and retains the benefit of both the periodic compensation payments and a lump sum compensation payment.
 He [Mr Hanrahan, counsel for Mr Clark] pointed to counsel, Mr R Ingram's affidavit of 22 February 2006 (T27) in which Mr Ingram had deposed in relation to Mr Clark that the claim for future economic loss was to date from October 2000 only to age 65, and that was thus an inherent unfairness to the Applicant. 32.
 Mr Hanrahan also submitted that the preclusion period should have been calculated to begin on the day on which Mr Clark's loss of earnings began, that is 31 October 2000, (rather than 29 April 2005), and that this would have been the case if he had claimed a compensation affected payment such as Newstart instead of having received periodic payments of workers compensation before the settlement at the District Court.
 The expression "special circumstances" in s 1184K does not embrace the circumstance that the 50 percent rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive, even grossly excessive, having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity, to the age of the injured person, and perhaps to other circumstances. 76 Once one embarks on an inquiry of the kind that would be required in such a case, one is defeating the legislative intention.
