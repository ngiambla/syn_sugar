 There is no dispute that it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that Jianshe Southern Pty Ltd, the applicant in the proceedings, will be unable to pay the respondents' costs if they are successful in their defence.
 If your client cannot (or does not) satisfy us by no later than 17 November 2006 that any costs order made in our clients' favour can be enforced, we shall apply for an order for security for costs.
 There is no doubt the respondents were aware of the Court's power to make an order for security for costs and, indeed, they raised the issue with the applicant's former solicitor in March 2006 and with the applicant's present solicitor in October 2006.
