 Counsel for the applicant opposes that course and sought to maintain privilege in each of them and in the events underlying them, notwithstanding the handing over of the copy documents.
 The urgent nature of the task at hand and the number of documents involved led to the solicitor in question simply not turning her mind to the existence of privilege in individual documents.
 I conclude that the document headed "Meeting Clayton Utz 11.05.07" would have immediately appeared to a competent solicitor to be a document that was prima facie privileged, Clayton Utz being the firm of solicitors representing the applicant.
 Further, it would have appeared likely to such a solicitor that the documents had been produced as a result of a mistake once the nature of them was appreciated when they were inspected for the purposes of preparation for the case.
