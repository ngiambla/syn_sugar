 Privilege is claimed pursuant to s 119 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the Act) which is agreed to be the appropriate source in this case at this stage rather than the common law.
 He gave evidence of being present at a meeting on 18 May 2007 with other persons connected with the Office of Workplace Services and a number of employees of the respondent, together with at least the New South Wales State Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union.
 Counsel for the respondent also referred to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Westpac Banking Corporation v 789Ten Pty Ltd (2005) 55 ACSR 519; [2005] NSWCA 321 , particularly per Tobias JA at [57]---[58].
 Counsel for the applicant did not refer to authority but submitted, as he had in an earlier argument as to s 119 , that a wide meaning should be given to the provision of professional legal services relating to a proceeding.
 Counsel submitted that the case fell within both limbs of subs (a) of s 119. 6 I do not see Mr Johns as a lawyer acting for the client in this meeting.
 I deduce from the evidence that the principal purpose of the meeting was to keep the potential witnesses and beneficiaries informed as to what was taking place in order both to do the right thing and to secure the continuing cooperation of those persons and the union which had coverage.
 It was not a meeting in which evidence was sought or obtained, nor was any legal advice sought or given or any report given as to confidential legal advice, at least so far as the evidence before me goes.
 At the invitation of counsel for the applicant, and without objection, I inspected the documents pursuant to s 133 of the Act for the purpose of assessing the nature of the documents rather than reading them as such.
 Even if the employees could be regarded as having a common interest with the applicant, (s 122(5)(b)) , (a doubtful proposition), the presence of the union official cannot be explained in that way.
