 Dr Taylor identifies a number of the mythic traditions recounted in the oral traditions of the present day claimant group and demonstrates that the claimants have both maintained continuity of tradition and custom and continuity of physical presence on the pastoral lease. 33 Dr Taylor at pp 9 to 14 of Annexure 'D' to his affidavit demonstrates the content of the normative system of traditional law and custom of the native title claimant group.
 They are: (a) occupation and economic rights; (b) control and management rights; (c) rights concerning speaking for the country and maintaining the cultural heritage: and (d) rights to determine membership and resolve disputes among members. 34 Dr Taylor concludes that consistent with the maintenance of ancestral tradition and custom and physical presence in the Determination Area, the claimant groups have possessed and asserted this normative system of traditional laws and customs since the assertion of sovereignty over the claim area.
 That term is used to describe the total body of the claimant's knowledge about the land and associated features of its topography, species and resources and those traditions, customs and practices relating to sites, tracks, ceremonies, rituals and matters such as a knowledge of the value of particular food and the medicinal and religious properties of plants, animals and other natural resources. 37 As to the right to determine membership and resolve disputes among clan members, Dr Taylor identifies a well established reservation by the claimant group of the right to determine its membership and to settle disputes in relation to land and waters according to particular traditions which form part of the law and custom.
