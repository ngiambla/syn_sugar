 First, so long as there was material supporting the conclusion reached by the Tribunal, it was a question of fact whether the material before the Tribunal raised a reasonable hypothesis of alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse which was not appealable under s 44 of the AAT Act .
 Secondly, the disorders (alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse) were not two distinct disorders but degrees of gradation of the one disorder --- alcohol abuse. 25 In support of the second basis, the veteran referred to the decision of Dowsett J in Constable v Repatriation Commission [2005] FCA 928 which concerned the conditions of alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse.
 That analysis and, in particular, the need for the Tribunal to address the kinds of questions set out at [36] is relevant to this ground of appeal. 42 This aspect of the decision of the Tribunal will also be set aside and remitted to the Tribunal for further hearing and determination according to law.
