 An application to the Federal Magistrates Court to set aside the decision of the Tribunal for jurisdictional error was dismissed on 8 February 2007. 3 I will not repeat the detailed background to the present appeal or the reasons for decision of the Tribunal or of the Federal Magistrate.
 I gave leave to the appellant to appeal out of time from the decision of the Federal Magistrate in the limited terms referred to because I considered that it was reasonably arguable by the appellant that the exercise of the discretion whether or not to cancel the visa involved jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.
