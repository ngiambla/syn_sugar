 An application to the Federal Magistrates Court to set aside the decision of the Tribunal for jurisdictional error was dismissed on 8 February 2007. 3 I will not repeat the detailed background to the present appeal or the reasons for decision of the Tribunal or of the Federal Magistrate.
 I gave leave to the appellant to appeal out of time from the decision of the Federal Magistrate in the limited terms referred to because I considered that it was reasonably arguable by the appellant that the exercise of the discretion whether or not to cancel the visa involved jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.
 There follows the matters referred to in [3] above. 10 Having regard to those matters, and the terms of MSI 368 generally, I accept the submission that it does not prescribe matters in cl 17.2.1 which the Tribunal was obliged to take into account when considering how to exercise the discretion as to whether to cancel the visa, once the breach of Condition 8101 had been made out.
