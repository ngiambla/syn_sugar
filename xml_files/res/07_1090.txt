 The original Application for Review form indicated that the Tribunal would send copies of all correspondence to his nominated adviser. 5 By letter dated 31 January 2002 the Tribunal advised the appellant that it was unable to make a decision in favour of the appellant based on the information before it and invited the appellant to attend a hearing scheduled for 22 February 2002.
 The appellant submitted that the invitation from the Tribunal inviting him to a hearing was sent to the appellant's migration agent to an address which, although shown on the fax cover sheet of the migration agent, did not correspond with the address provided by the appellant in his original Application for Review.
 Furthermore his Honour found that the appellant's complaint regarding the Minister's conduct in relation to the s 48B application did not show any error in the Tribunal's decision, and that in any event the Minister was under no obligation to exercise his power under s 48B of the Act.
 His Honour also noted that s 441A(4) of the Act provided a method by which the Tribunal gives a document to a person is to date the document and dispatch it by prepaid post within 3 working days to the last address for service, or last residential or business address provided by the appellant.
