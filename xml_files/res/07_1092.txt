 The appellant claimed that the Tribunal breached s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') in relation to his knowledge of Christianity, the letter, and the finding as to his ability to manage the other parts of his life.
 The appellant also claimed that the Tribunal failed to comply with its obligations under s 425 of the Act because at the hearing he was frequently interrupted, misunderstood, ' given strong pressure ' and that the Tribunal failed to indicate the issues to him. 10 Smith FM found that the ground relating to s 424A of the Act had no merit because the Tribunal drew upon information given by the appellant at the hearing in its reasoning.
 The appellant also has not tendered the transcript of the Tribunal hearing. 15 In NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 241 the Full Court observed at [21] that the Federal Magistrate whose decision was being challenged had no transcript of the Tribunal's hearing before him and there was 'simply no basis upon which his Honour could properly have made this finding' of mis- interpretation.
