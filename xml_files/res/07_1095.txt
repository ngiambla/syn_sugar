 The appellant sought judicial review of such decision and on 19 December 2003 the Migration Review Tribunal ('the MRT') affirmed the Department's decision to cancel the appellant's visa. 3 On 10 February 2004 the appellant lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) visa which was refused by the Department on 11 May 2004.
 The Tribunal erred in that it failed to provide the appellant with an adequate opportunity to present all of the relevant evidence and acted contrary to the rules of natural justice; 4.
 The Tribunal erred in that it failed to inform the appellant that it had questioned the impartiality of a witness and the appellant was precluded from calling other impartial witnesses to prove his involvement in political activities in Australia; 5.
 The appellant also claimed that he would have called additional witnesses had he been informed that the Tribunal did not regard the witnesses called by the appellant as impartial. 19 The transcript records the fact that the interpreter was required to leave the hearing early on that day.
