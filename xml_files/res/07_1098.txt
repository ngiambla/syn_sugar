 Pursuant to reg 1.15A(1), to be a spouse of another, for these purposes, a person must be in "a married relationship, as described in subregulation (1A)" or "a de facto relationship, as described in subregulation (2)".
 The state of the evidence led the Tribunal to state that it was "not satisfied that the visa applicant and the sponsor have demonstrated a genuine commitment to each other as spouses at the time of decision".
 It should be borne in mind that, as stated above, the appellant's alleged persistence with her application in the face of a foreshadowed refusal was not of itself a consideration that the Tribunal was, as a matter of law, bound to take into account.
