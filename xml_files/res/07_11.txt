 In relation to s 45E, I said that the evidence established that the CEPU made demands which instigated, induced and procured Edison to make both the broader arrangement and the heads of agreement, and that the same evidence established that the CEPU aided and abetted, and was knowingly concerned in, the making of a contract, arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU.
 I agree with the ACCC's submissions that the actions taken by the CEPU were deliberately undertaken at a time when Edison was vulnerable to the demands made by the CEPU because of its urgent need to get the Simon Engineering site agreement signed and to commence construction on the peaker project. 44 The ACCC submitted that the CEPU's actions were covert, as well as deliberate.
