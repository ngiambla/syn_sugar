 In relation to s 45E, I said that the evidence established that the CEPU made demands which instigated, induced and procured Edison to make both the broader arrangement and the heads of agreement, and that the same evidence established that the CEPU aided and abetted, and was knowingly concerned in, the making of a contract, arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU.
 In oral submissions, senior counsel for the ACCC accepted that there was a very substantial overlap in the conduct by which the CEPU aided, abetted, counselled, procured and induced the making of an arrangement in contravention of s 45E(3), and the conduct by which it incited, induced and procured Edison to give effect to the offending provision of that arrangement.
 At trial, senior counsel for the ACCC expressly submitted that the ACCC relied on the same conduct by the CEPU over a relatively short period of time between 9 August and 23 August 2001 in connection with both contraventions. 38 The ACCC's submission fails to take into account the full ambit of my findings concerning the contract, arrangement or understanding between Edison and the CEPU.
 I agree with the ACCC's submissions that the actions taken by the CEPU were deliberately undertaken at a time when Edison was vulnerable to the demands made by the CEPU because of its urgent need to get the Simon Engineering site agreement signed and to commence construction on the peaker project. 44 The ACCC submitted that the CEPU's actions were covert, as well as deliberate.
