 As explained below, the Investa Group comprises Investa itself and the Investa Property Trust, a listed unit trust of which Investa is the responsible entity. 3 According to the evidence, based on the closing price on 30 May 2007, being the day immediately prior to the date of the Implementation Agreement referred to below, the Investa Group had a market capitalisation of approximately $4.1 billion.
 MSRE manages approximately US$55.6 billion in real estate assets on behalf of its clients. 5 By the Implementation Agreement, Investa and Morgan Stanley agreed to implement a scheme by which, subject to security holders' agreement and Court approval, Morgan Stanley Bidco or a related body corporate of Morgan Stanley would acquire all of the shares in Investa (the Shares) and units in the Investa Property Trust that are "stapled" to the Shares (the Units) (together, the Securities).
 Those expressions, in turn, are defined to mean respectively Shares and Units held by or on behalf of Morgan Stanley Bidco. 13 The Scheme consideration in respect of each Security held by a Scheme Participant is $3.00 cash, but if Investa or the Investa Property Trust should declare or pay any dividend or distribution, other than that of eight cents per Security previously mentioned, before the Share and Unit Schemes are implemented, then the consideration for each Security means $3.00 less the amount per Security of all such distributions and dividends, the record date for which precedes the Implementation Date. 14 The Scheme sets out various conditions precedent on which the Share Scheme is conditional, including, of course, approval by the Court in accordance with s 411(4)(b) of the Act, with or without modifications.
