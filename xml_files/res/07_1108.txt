 I assessed the circumstances of the children in relation to their father Mr HOPKINS and found that, based on Mr HOPKINS' submissions and the relevant reports of the Department of Community Services, the children are under the foster care of the Department of Community Services until they reach the age of 18.
 The applicant primarily relied on the comments of the Full Court in Wan , which held that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") had failed to treat the best interests of the children as a primary consideration in the determination.
 The Department in fact took a number of steps to inform itself of the circumstances concerning the children, including by requesting the applicant's welfare officer to discuss matters affecting the children with the applicant and provide the Department with further information.
