 The proposed cross-claim would allege that Freehills was engaged by Sirtex in 1997 and 2000 to undertake due diligence work in connection with the formation of Sirtex as a public company and its subsequent preparation of an initial public offering and listing on the Australia Stock Exchange (ASX).
 Refuse leave to cross-claim, albeit Dr Gray would be free to pursue his cross-claim by separate proceedings against Freehills (1997) and Freehills (2000). 48 The first option, which would involve hearing the cross-claim as part of the trial of the primary action is plainly not practicable.
 The allegations raised against Freehills (1997) and Freehills (2000) involve new issues going to the contractual arrangements entered into between the Freehills' respondents and Sirtex, the performance of the retainers, the operation of the due diligence committee and the role of Dr Gray on it.
