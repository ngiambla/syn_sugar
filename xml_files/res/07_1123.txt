 The Tribunal held that, given the passage of time, any involvement that the first applicant may have had in the pro-democracy movement was so remote that there was no real chance he would face persecution on returning to China.
 The applicants' counsel conceded that, in this regard, the Tribunal had correctly applied s 91R(3) of the Act. 17 For the reasons I am about to state, I reject the relevant considerations ground.
 The Tribunal also notes the applicant's evidence that he did not lodge a protection visa application until eight years after his arrival because the Australian authorities do not publicise the success of applications.
