 A successful party might be disentitled to an order for costs (or limited to an order for a proportion of the costs) if it has engaged in conduct which demonstrates some degree of contribution to either the level of costs incurred or a particular class of costs being incurred (such as costs relating to a particular issue).
 The respondent says it ought to be awarded the costs unless it can be demonstrated it has brought about litigation; has done something connected with the institution of the suit calculated to occasion unnecessary litigation and expense; or has engaged in some wrongful act in the course of the transaction about which the claimant complains. 10 In this case there is no conduct on the part of the Repatriation Commission which would disentitle it to an award of costs against Mr Jakab.
 The respondent conducted the response to the application properly and professionally and simply sought to demonstrate that the application lacked merit. 11 It seems to me that there is no special consideration to be brought to bear in the exercise of the discretion based upon the recognition that the litigation is one between a citizen and an authority such as the Repatriation Commission or the Commonwealth.
