 The specific relief sought is a declaration that both transactions are void by operation of s 120 , or, further, alternatively, pursuant to s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act , and an order that the respondent forthwith transfer to the applicants all right, title and interest in and to the fee simple of the property as previously described (subject to the existing registered mortgage in favour of the National Australia Bank Limited). 11 The failure of the respondent to appear at the directions hearing, of course, reflected in the express consent or express recognition by the respondent that the respondent is content for the court to deal with the application this morning, raises the question of the basis upon which the court can proceed to enter judgment for the applicants for the relief claimed.
 As to the second limb, the applicants contend that the transferee gave consideration of less value than the market value of the property. 14 In the statement of claim at paragraph 4, the applicants contend that the market value of the property was approximately $300,000 and, by paragraph 6, the applicants contend that the transfer on 21 November 2005 by Amanda Glass to the respondent occurred pursuant to a written contract between Amanda Glass and the respondent for a purchase price of $290,000. 15 It seems to me a little difficult to conclude on the face of those facts that there has been, for the purpose of s 120 , a transfer of property for consideration of less value than the market value, if the market value was 'approximately $300,000' as pleaded and the contract price as pleaded is $290,000.
 It is hereby declared that a transfer of land, described by reference to the property description identified in these reasons, pursuant to a contract of sale dated 21 November 2005, entered into between Amanda Marie Cranley (otherwise known as Amanda Marie Glass) and the respondent, pursuant to which the said Amanda Marie Glass transferred to the respondent all right, title and interests in the land as described, is void as against the applicants, by operation of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth); and 2.
