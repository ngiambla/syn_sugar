 It is hereby declared that a transfer of land, described by reference to the property description identified in these reasons, pursuant to a contract of sale dated 21 November 2005, entered into between Amanda Marie Cranley (otherwise known as Amanda Marie Glass) and the respondent, pursuant to which the said Amanda Marie Glass transferred to the respondent all right, title and interests in the land as described, is void as against the applicants, by operation of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth); and 2.
