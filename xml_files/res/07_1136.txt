 THE TRADE PRACTICES CLAIM Introduction to the claim 74 Mr Lewarne claims that, at the three meetings described above (the Mosman, Rosebery and Alexandria meetings) and in the two documents that allegedly outlined the basis of his agreement with Momentum and Mr Scotts, Mr Scotts made various representations that were misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive.
 Mr Scotts and/or Momentum would continue to operate the ten existing poker machines at the hotel and would, as one of the initial plans for the business after the assignment date, procure and operate 5 additional poker machines at the hotel; 6.
 Mr Scotts admitted that these representations had been made, to the extent only that Momentum had open to it an option on the lease that, if exercised, would have allowed the hotel business to operate out of the premises for a total period of 22 years.
 Mr Scotts claims that the payment was made pursuant to an agreement in respect of Lewarne's purchase of shares in Momentum Productions, that any such agreement has been terminated and accordingly that the money ought to be repaid.
