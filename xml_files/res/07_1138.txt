 The applicant sought to associate the non-disclosure of a degenerative condition in the right knee with the disease which the Tribunal found to have been aggravated, by treating the disease as pre-existing degeneration of both knees. 69 The applicant acknowledges that there is no false and wilful misrepresentation to the effect that he did not suffer, and had not previously suffered from, a degenerative condition in his left knee.
 In this particular case, the Tribunal did not make the finding upon which the applicant's contention is premised and in fact did not find that the degenerative conditions in the applicant's right and left knees were a single ailment, and should therefore be treated as a single disease.
 Consequently, the Tribunal did not regard his conduct as serious and wilful misconduct because it did not regard that conduct, that is the misrepresentations relating to his previous medical condition, as the respondent exposing him or others to any significant and immediate risk of serious injury.
