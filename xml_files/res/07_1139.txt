 The secured sum, as the judgment in favour of the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East shows, is very much in excess of the balance of the funds held in the ship account. 14 I therefore order that the Marshal pay out to the Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East, as soon as practicable, the balance of the amount held in the ship account.
 The Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East is entitled to participate in that distribution to the extent that its judgment remains unsatisfied after it has received as a priority payment on the balance of the funds remaining in the ship account secured by its mortgage. 25 The amounts to be paid out proportionately cannot presently be calculated with exactitude.
