 Mr Ding said that he was not happy with the volume he was achieving from the applicant, and said that if the respondent wanted to order the MC-801 again, Suzhou Fak would supply it.
 First, it alleges that, by displaying an image of the MC-801 bagless vacuum cleaner on its internet web site, by offering the vacuum cleaner for sale, and by selling the vacuum cleaner, the respondent infringed its registered design.
 It does not admit the making of any agreement between the applicant and Suzhou Fak in January 2005, and says that it knew of the "exclusive certification" document dated 10 January 2005 only in October 2006 when provided with a copy of it by the applicant.
