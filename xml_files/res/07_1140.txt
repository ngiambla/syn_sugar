 Accordingly, in this case the Court can only set aside the Minister's decision for jurisdictional error: Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at 506-508 and 511 per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; Tuncok v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 172 at [8] .
 However simply because there are indications that the relevant officers in the Department have considered each child separately does not mean that this task has been carried out by the Minister. 21 In his Statement of Reasons, the Minister refers to the children cumulatively, singling out only one child (Darryl Holani).
 I have considered this issue carefully, and take a different view. 28 First, in almost every respect it appears that, contrary the submission of Mr Duncan, factors relevant to the best interests of the four children of the applicant did coincide, in that the material before the Minister indicated that the applicant provided them with financial and emotional support, and that there was a close relationship between him and them.
