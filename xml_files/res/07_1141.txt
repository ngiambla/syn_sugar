 Specifically, Stena alleged that the hull forms of three types of vessels manufactured, sold or promoted by Austal --- namely the Austal 94, Austal 196 and Austal 285 hull forms --- infringed its patent. 2 In response, Austal filed a cross-claim seeking revocation of the patent for invalidity on the grounds of lack of novelty, lack of inventive step or obviousness, and/or failure to comply with the requirements of s 40 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth). 3 On 21 June 2007, I handed down my reasons for judgment.
 The reasons were given effect by orders proposed by the parties and made by me on 20 July 2007. 4 By Orders 7, 8 and 9, I directed the parties to file written submissions on the question of costs, and noted that it would be determined on the papers.
 Despite its failure on these points, Stena maintains that no apportionment of costs is appropriate due to the overlap in the evidence and submissions concerning the Austal 94 hull form on the one hand and the Austal 196 and Austal 285 hull forms on the other; the acceptance of Stena's submissions on other points such as construction and invalidity; its acknowledgement that the Austal 196 and Austal 285 infringement case was "close to the margins"; its restraint on adducing evidence and making submissions concerning only the Austal 196 and Austal 285 hull forms; and the way in which any such submissions and evidence was interwoven with its response to Austal's invalidity case. 6 As an alternative, Stena argues that any apportionment should be an extremely modest one, in the order of 1 to 2% of the total costs incurred by it in the proceedings. 7 Austal submits that a larger adjustment in its favour is appropriate.
