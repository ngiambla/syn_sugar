 Counsel for the applicant made no reference to the letter from the Victoria Police, or to the applicant's admission that he had been apprehended with two caps of heroin on 15 August 2004.
 The fact that the letter was not raised in cross-examination of Dr Kennedy is part of another issue, concerned with whether the Minister's advocate should have asked Dr Kennedy if he was aware of the August 2004 offences.
 When she objected to the Minister's advocate's submission that the applicant had not demonstrated that he was motivated to change, counsel for the applicant described the issue of the applicant's motivation as one of the major issues of the case.
