 At that time, the Migration Act provided that when the Minister granted or refused to grant a visa, he or she was to notify the applicant of the decision in the prescribed way: s 66(1).
 Significantly, s 66(4) went on to provide that " [f]ailure to give notification of a decision [did] not affect the validity of the decision. " The Decision was and remains a valid decision. 11 That outcome is not altogether harsh.
