 The Tribunal had regard to several inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence. 10 The Tribunal noted that the appellant had stated in his protection visa that he was introduced to Falun Gong when he received a brochure in the mail.
 The appellant claimed that he had telephoned a number that was listed in the brochure, and that the woman who had answered the phone led him to the process of Falun Dafa and had invited him to a meeting.
 The appellant also did not respond to this inconsistency when it was put to him in the s 424A letter. 14 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was a witness of truth and concluded that he had created the claims in order to obtain the visa sought.
