 On the basis of communications between the Chief of Staff of the Justice Minister and an officer of the Department, and despite the absence of notice to the applicant under s 16(4) , the Tribunal found that the applicant's request to the Justice Minister was transferred to the Department on 25 September 2003. 24 The Tribunal then dealt with the crucial question whether the requests were transferred in accordance with s 16 of the FOI Act .
 It is true that there is not to be found in the provisions of the FOI Act any express imposition of a duty on the recipient of a request for access to documents to search its records to ascertain whether it has documents answering the description in the request.
 As is shown by the fact that she requested that each request not be transferred, she sought to exercise that right. 39 The Tribunal was therefore in error when it said in its reasons for decision in each case that s 16(1)(b) does not raise a question of whether the Attorney-General or the Justice Minister knew the whereabouts of the documents sought by the applicant, and that it did not raise a question whether the documents sought actually existed.
