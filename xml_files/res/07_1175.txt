 The above comments are without prejudice and would be subject to Contract. '` Apart from the references to 'EBITDA' as a means of measurement of quantification of purchase price to be payable by Foundation for the OSMC, the Foundation requirement that 'your doctors sign a three-year Service Contract' may be observed; such service contracts were thus required to be entered into by the medical practitioners then practising at the OSMC in favour of Foundation as the incoming operator of the OSMC.
 Mr O'Shanassy described those premises as '... ideal for a multi-faced medical centre'. 82 Shortly thereafter on or about 17 May 2001, Mr O'Shanassy attended a meeting at the offices of Foundation with Dr Ken Jones of Foundation and Drs Fox and Gesovic of the OSMC, in the course of which Dr Jones was said by Mr O'Shanassy to have stated to Dr Fox, in response to Dr Fox's assertion in the nature of an ultimatum thereupon made, that he could get a $250,000 key man payment elsewhere.
 Mr O'Shanassy testified at [82] of his lengthy affidavit evidence as to the following further conversation having occurred between himself, Dr Jones and Dr Gesovic, in the absence of Dr Fox, as follows: '[Mr O'Shanassy]: I just do not understand your logic --- it is an ambit claim by Dr Fox --- it's a try on --- and you fell for it. [Dr Jones]: Look, we need to keep doctors like Fox happy, we will all benefit from his continued involvement at Oxford Square medical.
 Foundation made the further contention that the Court should '... pay no heed to the ludicrous suggestion that a corporate entity [would have]... conducted the financial and business affairs of the business not with [the] primary objective being to ensure that the purchaser achieves EBITDA', that being described as an alleged intention on the part of Foundation as a public company which could 'rarely be inferred and certainly not on the limited evidentiary material available to the Court in these proceedings'.
