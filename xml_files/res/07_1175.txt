 The above comments are without prejudice and would be subject to Contract. '` Apart from the references to 'EBITDA' as a means of measurement of quantification of purchase price to be payable by Foundation for the OSMC, the Foundation requirement that 'your doctors sign a three-year Service Contract' may be observed; such service contracts were thus required to be entered into by the medical practitioners then practising at the OSMC in favour of Foundation as the incoming operator of the OSMC.
 Foundation made the further contention that the Court should '... pay no heed to the ludicrous suggestion that a corporate entity [would have]... conducted the financial and business affairs of the business not with [the] primary objective being to ensure that the purchaser achieves EBITDA', that being described as an alleged intention on the part of Foundation as a public company which could 'rarely be inferred and certainly not on the limited evidentiary material available to the Court in these proceedings'.
