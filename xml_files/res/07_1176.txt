 It advised him that he should immediately advise the Tribunal of any change of address and telephone number and stated: 'If you do not, you might not receive an invitation to a hearing or other important information and your case may be decided without further notice'. 8 The letter further explained that the applicant might be invited to a hearing, which was an opportunity to give the Tribunal evidence to support his application.
 The Tribunal stated that: 'Without further details, clarifications, corroborative evidence and without having had the opportunity to explore the claims with the applicant at a hearing and test the evidence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant has ever been a Falun Gong practitioner, or that he has ever engaged in Falun Gong activities.
 In essence and for the stated reasons, the Tribunal is not satisfied tha the applicant has suffered or would suffer any of the claimed harm. ' 14 The Tribunal could not be satisfied that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention related reason and accordingly the decision not to grant a protection visa was affirmed.
