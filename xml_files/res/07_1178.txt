 The Direction contained requirements with which the Resource Planning and Development Commission (RPDC) had to comply, including the addressing of "the environmental, social, economic and community issues relevant to the Project". 28 On 13 December 2004, the then Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, received a referral from Gunns under the EPBC Act (first referral).
 The proposal outlined in the first referral was "to establish a bleached Kraft pulp mill in northern Tasmania". 29 On 16 December 2004, the RPDC issued a media statement announcing that it was "in the process of preparing draft guidelines that Gunns will be required to follow in the preparation of its draft Integrated Impact Statement".
 Counsel contend this demonstrates prejudgment and that the Minister misunderstood what an informed decision is for the purposes of the EPBC Act. 122 In order to decide on assessment on preliminary documentation, the Minister must be satisfied under s 87(5) that the assessment approach will allow an informed decision to be made on whether or not to approve, for the purposes of each controlling provision, the taking of the action.
