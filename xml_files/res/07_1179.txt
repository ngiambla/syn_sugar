 Under s 75(5), the Minister is obliged to make the controlled action decision within 20 business days after receiving the referral. 12 By contrast, there is no obligation on the Minister to invite comments and consider comments when making an assessment approach decision under s 87 of the EPBC Act. 13 There is no requirement in the EPBC Act to invite comments, or to consider the views of the public, on what assessment approach should be adopted.
 This tells strongly against the suggestion that the Minister has an obligation to accord procedural fairness to interested persons and the public concerning an assessment approach decision under s 87. 14 The Minister must consider the matters set out in s 87(3) in making an assessment approach decision under s 87(1).
 Those matters include, under s 87(3)(c), an obligation to consider any relevant information received in response to an invitation to the appropriate State or Territory Minister to comment on whether the action is a controlled action and to give the Minister "information relevant to deciding which approach would be appropriate to assess the relevant impacts of the action..." (see s 74(2)(b)(ii)). 15 There is no similar obligation for the Minister to invite or consider any other comments on an assessment approach decision.
