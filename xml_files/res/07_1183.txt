 The Federal Magistrate noted that a Master dismissed the Supreme Court proceeding on 8 September 2006 and that accordingly it was of no assistance to the appellant.
 The appellant said that the proceeding before the Federal Magistrate amounted to an improper use by the respondents of their superior legal skills and resources generally.
 The Federal Magistrate said that a failure to serve in accordance with an order for substituted service does not preclude service in the usual manner, and that this had occurred in this case.
 I think what the remainder of the ground alleges is that the appellant again tendered payment of the debt on 10 August 2006, not for the purpose of having the tender accepted but rather to demonstrate that he was solvent.
