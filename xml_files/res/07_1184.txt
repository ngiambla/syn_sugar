 The Tribunal set out the relevant law in its written Statement of Decisions and Reasons to the following effect and with which I respectfully agree. 7 The Tribunal's jurisdiction arises if a valid application is made under s 412 of the Act for review of an RRT-reviewable decision.
 The Tribunal found that the decision notification letter, which was dated 30 June 2006, was sent by prepaid post on 30 June 2006 from a place in Australia to the applicant's address in Australia, which was provided by the appellant to the Minister for the purposes of her receiving documents. 14 The Tribunal further found that the decision notification letter, which was dispatched within 3 working days of the date of the letter to the applicant's correct address, was in accordance with s 494B(4) of the Act.
 Therefore, given the Tribunal's findings regarding when the applicant was taken to have been notified of the decision of the delegate and the applicable prescribed period, the Tribunal found that the last day on which the application for review could be lodged was 8 August 2006.
