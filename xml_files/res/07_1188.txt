 He was enrolled to study at that College from 31 January 2005. 4 It was a condition of the visa that the appellant comply with condition 8202 as set out in Schedule 8 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ("the Regulations ").
 He observed that that amendment took effect without retrospective operation as from 8 October 2005 after both the delegate's decision and the MRT decision, and was therefore of no assistance to the appellant. 16 The appellant's amended notice of appeal identifies four grounds of appeal.
 Detailed particulars of each of these grounds were provided. 17 Ms Welshman, counsel for the appellant, frankly conceded before me that none of the grounds in the amended notice of appeal had been argued before the Federal Magistrate.
 Clause 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations relevantly provided, prior to 8 October 2005, that for the proposes of s 116(3) the Minister must cancel a Student (Temporary) Class TU visa if satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with condition 8202.
