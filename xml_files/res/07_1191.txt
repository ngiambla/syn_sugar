 Evidence 3 The debt the subject of the bankruptcy notice was $21,638.30 being the amount taxed by Master Bruce of the Supreme Court of Victoria as the costs of the Assignor pursuant to orders made against the Debtor in the Supreme Court in 2004 and 2005.
 In any event, applying the authorities to which reference has been made, I am satisfied that the bankruptcy notice has been issued as a means to secure payment of the debt and further that it has a collateral purpose.
 The collateral purpose in my view having regard to the history set out in the court's earlier decision in Etl v Settle [[2004] FMCA 718] was to circumvent the operation of s.44 of the Bankruptcy Act .
 This contrived arrangement is an inappropriate use of bankruptcy proceedings and a blatant attempt to avoid the consequences of the operation of s.44 of the Bankruptcy Act . " Conclusion on appeal 17 There was no evidence to base the finding in [59] that the Creditor issued the notice "solely" for the purpose of securing payment of the debt.
