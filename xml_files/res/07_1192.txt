 I am satisfied that the Court also has inherent jurisdiction, having been seized of jurisdiction to deal with the appeal, to stay the operation of the sentence: Tait v The Queen [1962] HCA 57 ; (1962) 108 CLR 620 at 624-625. 3 The circumstances of this case show that the appellant gave an unconditional bail undertaking to appear at the District Court of New South Wales at Campbelltown at 9.30 am today and thereafter to attend at that court at such day and at such time and place as was, from time to time, specified in a notice to be given or sent to him.
 The parties will then be able to debate, in an informed way, before the Court the way in which the appeal ought thereafter to proceed, the appellant's entitlement to bail, and the conditions, if any, which ought to attach to any grant of bail that might be appropriate to give to the appellant. 5 In my opinion it would not be just to require the appellant to commence tonight to serve his weekend detention having regard to the circumstances in which the matter has come before the Court that I have set out. 6 In those circumstances I propose, subject to hearing from the solicitor for the appellant as to any comments he has to make as to the form of the orders, to make orders in the terms that I have suggested are appropriate.
