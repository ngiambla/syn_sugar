 It is apparent, on my reading of the Tribunal decision, that the Tribunal was aware of the claim that Buddhists were subject to general discrimination amounting to persecution in Bangladesh, and was not only aware that the applicant was a Buddhist but was prepared to make that finding.
 The applicant was asked about that and replied to it, saying that his village, in particular, was not a good place for Buddhists; there are Muslims and Buddhists living there but Buddhist religious programs have been threatened.
 The applicant went on to refer, in vague terms, as the Tribunal said, to the killing of a local Buddhist leader in his area some two years earlier, and the Tribunal noted that that murder had been widely reported, and referred to independent country information.
