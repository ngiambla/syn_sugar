 It is also claimed by Westpac that the second and third defendants received, for no consideration, cheques and money from Mr Ollis knowing that Mr Ollis did not have the funds to meet the cheques on presentation, that Westpac was honouring the cheques by mistake and that Mr Ollis had obtained the money by presentation of cheques that Westpac honoured by mistake. 7 On 19 January 2006, the New South Wales Crime Commission obtained restraining orders against Mr Ollis and the other defendants to the proceedings and summary judgment in respect of asset forfeiture on 7 June 2006 under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW).
 The defendants sought leave to appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal in respect of such judgment and the decision in respect of these proceedings is currently reserved. 8 On 21 November 2006 Westpac obtained orders in the Supreme Court of New South Wales which restrained Mr Ollis from dealing with property and assets claimed by Westpac. 9 On 27 July 2007 a sequestration order was made against the estate of Mr Ollis by Federal Magistrate Smith and Shaun Gregory Condon and Brian Gleeson were appointed trustees of Mr Ollis' bankrupt estate.
 On 7 August 2007 a Notice of Appeal from the decision of Smith FM was filed by Mr Ollis. 10 Both Mr Condon and Mr Gleeson have been notified that Westpac intends to join them as defendants in the proceedings in their capacity as trustees of Mr Ollis' bankrupt estate.
