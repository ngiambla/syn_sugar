 The Tribunal commented that the reason that the Tribunal found against the appellant in relation to these matters, was because the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a witness of truth. 11 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, in either China or Australia, commenting that if he were a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, he would have been able to tell the Tribunal more about Falun Gong, as well as describe or name the Falun Gong exercises.
 The Tribunal found that if the appellant had practised Falun Gong in China between 1998 and 2000 as he claimed, he would have been able to tell the Tribunal more about Falun Gong, and that he would have generally been able to explain the Falun Gong exercises.
 The Tribunal did not accept this explanation as plausible. 13 The Tribunal found there was no plausible evidence before it that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner, and that he would suffer persecution from authorities in China either now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, for Falun Gong activities if he returns to China.
