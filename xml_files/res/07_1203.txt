 In January 2007, whilst the applicant was still in immigration detention, the applicant received a letter from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs stating that because the circumstances of the cancellation of his visa in October 2003, were similar to those which were subject to the decision in Sales , he was to be released from immigration detention. 6 The applicant was released from immigration detention on 18 January 2007.
 The respondent went on to submit, in oral submissions, that the claim for damages for false imprisonment amounted to a collateral attack on a migration decision and, therefore, the Federal Court has no original jurisdiction to hear and determine the applicant's claim. 17 In light of my finding below, it is unnecessary to determine whether the detention of a person under s 189 of the Act is a privative clause decision.
 However, I will assume that to be the case. 18 The first question is whether, in the absence of the restriction sought to be imposed on the original jurisdiction of the Court by s 476A, this Court would have original jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim for damages for false imprisonment arising from a detention effected by a person acting, or purporting to act, under the Act.
