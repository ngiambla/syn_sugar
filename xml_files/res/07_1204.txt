 For example, ground 2 contends that his Honour should have found that by reason of the clearly distinguishable saffron robe that the appellant was required to wear, he would be persecuted for his religious belief.
 That witness had confirmed the appellant's claims of general mistreatment of Buddhists in Bangladesh. 22 The Minister submits that this ground simply invites merits review. 23 Ground 7 asserts that the RRT failed to consider all the materials readily available and/or accessible.
 The ground does not condescend to particulars. 24 The Minister submits that failure to take account of particular evidence, as opposed to a distinct claim would, even if established, not amount to an error going to jurisdiction.
 Insofar as the ground seeks to agitate the same matters that were raised before Scarlett FM, the Minister submits that the RRT does not have a legally enforceable duty to make enquiries: see WAGJ v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 277 at [24] ---[25] citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Anthonypillai [2001] FCA 274 ; (2001) 106 FCR 426 at [86] . 25 Grounds 8, 9 and 10 challenge findings of fact made by the RRT. 26 The Minister submits that these all invite merits review.
