 There was discussion about the cancellation of orders already made by Eurest and of Karma Foods contacting suppliers to take over the orders and place new purchase orders.
 He also canvassed the possibility that OTML fund and undertake an investigative audit into the accounts of Fubilan and Eurest to determine whether breaches of the management and financial responsibility in relation to the OTML Contract were occurring.
 Mr Yekim advised that OTML expected MRDC and MRSM to withdraw their involvement with Fubilan and that Mr Fenwick would resign as a director of Fubilan.
