 I will have, at the trial, power to make orders under a number of sections of the Evidence Act , including s 38 which deals with unfavourable witnesses, s 41 which deals with improper questions and, in particular, s 42 which deals with the power of the Court to limit or disallow the use of leading questions where, for example, a witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner or where the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination.
 I am, of course, anxious for the trial to proceed in the most efficient and expeditious manner as possible but I am unable to see any reason, at this stage, for making the orders sought in the notice of motion either in the form as filed or in the way in which it was confined by Mr Stevenson during argument. 12 Accordingly, the order I will make is that the motion be dismissed.
