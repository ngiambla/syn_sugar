 Parliament has also enacted a contributing fault mechanism into s 12GF of the ASIC Act (s 12GF(1B)), which applies to conduct in contravention of s 12DA (but not s 12DB) of the ASIC Act. 14 It was contended by the applicant that these amendments confirm that a plea of contributing fault is not available under the Commonwealth Legislation.
 These matters are in fact pleaded by the respondents against the applicant's claim, where the respondents plead that the relevant recommendations did not cause loss and damage to the applicant because the applicant redeemed its investment in full and the applicant invested the proceeds in Market Street. 101 In my view, the respondents must produce sufficient evidence to incline the mind towards an acceptance that loss or damage was caused by the misleading conduct complained of here to satisfy the requirements of O 15A r 6(a), where the relief sought by the respondents is for contribution or indemnity from PIR.
