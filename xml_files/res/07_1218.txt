 He concluded that the fact that the s 424A letter had been sent by the RRT at the time of the first hearing, rather than at the time of the second hearing, was of no consequence.
 He referred to SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 107 at [37] ---[44]; and SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 190 at [16] ---[17]. 15 Finally, the Federal Magistrate concluded that although the RRT may have erred when considering the question whether the appellant could relocate elsewhere in Dhaka or Bangladesh because it had not considered the reasonableness of his doing so, the error was of no consequence.
