 Introduction 1 In Adams v Lambert ('Adams') [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 225 ALR 396 the High Court held that a misdescription of the statutory source of an entitlement to claim interest on a judgment debt was a formal defect or irregularity within the purview of s 306 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act').
 However, in the present proceedings, Federal Magistrate Driver found that a misdescription of the statute under which post-judgment interest was claimed was a substantial defect in the bankruptcy notice which could not be cured by reference to that provision. 2 Thus, the learned Federal Magistrate's decision appears, at first sight, to be at odds with the unanimous judgment of the High Court in Adams.
 It stated that judgment was entered against Mr Roskell in the Local Court on 22 June 2000 and that interest was claimed from the date of judgment to 15 December 2004. 12 The attachment went on to say that interest was claimed under s 39 of the District Court (Civil Claims) Act 1970 (NSW).
