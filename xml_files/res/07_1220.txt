 At Mr Messenger's request a motion was passed authorising the College to write to funeral homes in Victoria in the following terms: "The letter is to advise you that on the authority of the celebrants involved with us we are increasing the standard fee to $400 plus GST $440.00.
 For this reason the International College of Celebrancy has decided to take the initiative in this situation, update the current fee and assure you that rises in the future will be issued annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. " 5 Mr Messenger invited the celebrants present to indicate whether they wished to be associated with the proposed letter.
