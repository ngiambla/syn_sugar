 At Mr Messenger's request a motion was passed authorising the College to write to funeral homes in Victoria in the following terms: "The letter is to advise you that on the authority of the celebrants involved with us we are increasing the standard fee to $400 plus GST $440.00.
 For this reason the International College of Celebrancy has decided to take the initiative in this situation, update the current fee and assure you that rises in the future will be issued annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. " 5 Mr Messenger invited the celebrants present to indicate whether they wished to be associated with the proposed letter.
 Mr Messenger also arranged for text from the letter to the funeral homes along with a reference to the agreed fee for celebrant's services at a civil ceremony to be posted on the College's website ( www.celebrancy.com ), where it remained until 8 August 2006. 7 The penalty that has been suggested for Dally M Publishing for attempting to contravene the Competition Code is $30,000 plus costs fixed in the amount $3,000, payable in four instalments between December 2007 and June 2010.
 The penalty suggested for Mr Messenger for attempting to induce contraventions of the Competition Code is $10,000 plus costs fixed in the amount $3,000, also payable in four instalments between December 2007 and June 2009.
