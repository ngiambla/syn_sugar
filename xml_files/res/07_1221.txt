 And, because ratification is possible, a practice has developed that when an action is brought without authority it will not be stayed or dismissed forthwith, but the company will be permitted to convene a general meeting or a meeting of its directors to consider whether to adopt the action: S.B.A.
 According to the minutes of that meeting "it was unanimously RESOLVED that [the] actions of Mr John Grezos on behalf of the company in instructing the firm of Paul Egan Associates on 16 June 2007 [to] defend the winding up application brought against the company by Land Mark Property Developments (Vic) Pty Ltd (in liquidation) be ratified. " Putting to one side for a moment the effect of this resolution, the defendant says that because the Constitution of the company vests the power of management in the directors there is no power in a general meeting to ratify the institution of legal proceedings.
 There it was held that where the articles of association of a company provided that the business of the company was to be managed by the directors, there was no power in a general meeting to make management decisions or to control or direct the board of directors in the management of the company.
