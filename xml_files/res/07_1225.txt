 Having regard to the circumstances of that matter, her Honour awarded costs on a party/party basis and also on an indemnity basis against a self represented litigant. 3 As I said in Rahman v Ashpole [2007] FCA 883 at [28] : 'The jurisdiction of the Court to order costs is conferred by s 43 of the FC Act.
 As that is the usual position it is not necessary to state that explicitly in the order. 6 One specific issue raised by Ms Penhall-Jones was whether costs should be allowed to the respondent for senior counsel.
 In a written submission in response the respondent sought a 'certification or declaration from the Court that senior counsel's involvement was appropriate'. 7 Whether costs should be allowed for two counsel, or for senior counsel, is normally a matter within the discretion of the taxing officer.
 The taxation of costs may, if necessary, be reviewed by a judge (O 62 r 11). 8 As to Ms Penhall-Jones' other submissions directed to quantifying the amount of costs which she should pay, these, like an allowance for senior counsel, are matters for the taxing officer if agreement is not reached. 9 Ms Penhall-Jones also submitted that any order for costs should be stayed until the outcome of other proceedings which are pending between herself and the respondent and which are listed for hearing commencing 3 December 2007.
