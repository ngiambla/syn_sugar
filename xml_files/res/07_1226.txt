 This ground is based on the decision in Appellant S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 216 CLR 473. 7 The second ground is that the tribunal failed to consider whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, having regard to his individual circumstances, characteristics and history, because it was necessary for him to be inactive politically in China in order to avoid persecution.
 The tribunal accepted that he had suffered employment difficulties after being released from prison but said: 'However, the Tribunal has already found that the authorities will no longer be interested in pursuing the [appellant] for events which took place in 2003 and for which he has already been punished.
 As McHugh and Kirby JJ said in Appellant S395 216 CLR at 489 [40]: '... persecution does not cease to be persecution for the purpose of the Convention because those persecuted can eliminate the harm by taking avoiding action within the country of nationality.
 He had claimed that he refused to sign a confession for some time '... because what I wanted was just respect and protection for our self-employed drivers' basic human rights'. 40 The Minister argued that the tribunal had found as a fact that the appellant had not been implicated in any political activity since 2003 or expressed an interest in further political activities in the reasonably foreseeable future.
