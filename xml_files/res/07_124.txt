 In general impractical (which is a relatively recent word, first recorded in the mid-19c. ) means 'not practical, unpractical', ie (of an idea or course of action) not sensible or realistic; (of a person) lacking the ability to do practical things.
 Only that which can be accomplished successfully or profitably under given circumstances may be called practical.
