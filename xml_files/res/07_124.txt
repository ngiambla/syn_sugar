 In general impractical (which is a relatively recent word, first recorded in the mid-19c. ) means 'not practical, unpractical', ie (of an idea or course of action) not sensible or realistic; (of a person) lacking the ability to do practical things.
 Nevertheless, the word used in the rule is "impractical", which is recognised widely as having a meaning different from "impracticable" and thus, arguably, its meaning is not just governed by notions of whether service is factually possible or feasible, but can include relative notions of sensible and realistic in the circumstances. 14 In Ricegrowers Co-operative Ltd v ABC Container Line NV (1996) 138 ALR 480 at 482 Tamberlin J said that "not practicable" in an English Rule to which he was referred was "essentially identical" in meaning to "impractical" in Order 7 Rule 9.
