 As events turned out, the applicant achieved less than the equivalent of six months' pay by way of damages on her contract claim, and I held that the damages which she did receive effectively extinguished any claim for further compensation which might otherwise have been available pursuant to s 170CR(1)(c) of the WR Act .
 However, on 22 November 2005, the respondents informed the applicant that the Amended Statement of Claim did not disclose a cause of action, and drew attention to the absence of any pleaded facts "linking or showing a causation" between the temporary illness of the applicant and the "alleged" termination of her employment.
 PARTICULARS The notice of termination was in writing by letter to the applicant dated 4 March 2005, and was confirmed by the respondents' then solicitor, Mr Rob Jackson of Slater Gordon in a telephone conversation with the appellant's solicitor on 9 March 2005.
 I have perused that Defence, and I am satisfied that it contains nothing that might not, by a reasonably conscientious approach to the litigation, have been included in a Defence filed on 2 December 2005 as ordered by Merkel J on 11 November 2005.
