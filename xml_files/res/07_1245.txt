 I fixed the matter for further hearing on 3 September 2007 (the further hearing directions). 4 Subsequently Cadbury brought a motion before the same Full Court asking that its previous order be varied and that the matter be remitted for a new trial, that is to say a hearing de novo .
 Cadbury contends that, in the light of comments made by the primary judge in the course of ruling on the admissibility of the affidavits of Dr Gibbs, his Honour expressed views that indicated his Honour no longer has an open mind concerning the weight that should be accorded to the disputed evidence.
 There is no reason to conclude that his Honour would not bring a fair and open mind to the question of specific objections to the disputed evidence and the resolution of the issues in the light of any part of the disputed evidence that might ultimately be admitted, consistently with these reasons. 114 In the circumstances, there is no reason why the proceeding should not be remitted to the primary judge for further hearing.
