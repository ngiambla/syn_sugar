 The study also found that there was no systematic promotion of organic products in Australia, so that Australian consumers were likely to have a low level of understanding of organic products and the certification processes, including the significance of certifying organisation labels.
 At approximately 2.11 pm on 9 March 2005, the first respondent received a fax from NASAA, stating that NASAA believed that eggs currently being sold under the name "Essential Foods" and claiming to be NASAA certified did not meet the product specification description as supplied by a NASAA certified producer.
 The second respondent has a greater involvement in the egg industry, although not the organic egg industry, both as a consultant to Farm Pride, acting as its national business manager, and as one of two directors of a company supplying labour to Farm Pride for the purposes of its egg business.
