 Mr Lever further contended that '[t]his request and denial clearly amounts to injury to [Mr Lever] in his employment relations with [ANSTO] as defined by the High Court in Patrick Stevedores [195 CLR 1]', though the submission was not amplified with specificity or exemplification by reference to the dicta cited earlier in these reasons from Patrick Stevedores concerning 'adverse affection of, or deterioration in, the advantages enjoyed by the employee ...' .
 For that reason it was said to be '... unnecessary for the Court to trouble itself with the subjective and difficult task of determining whether the grades and levels at which [ANSTO] classified [Mr Lever] from time to time were appropriate for a person with his skills, qualifications, responsibilities and experience, and having regard to the operational objectives of [ANSTO] at the relevant time'.
 He further testified that his said recommendation 'was not in any way based on Mr Lever's union membership, his role or activities as a union delegate, or his previous attempts to seek review', and moreover that he '... was conscious of trying to deal with Mr Lever's issues as an employee separately from issues in which he might be involved as a union delegate'.
