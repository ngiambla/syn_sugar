 The Federal Magistrate found that the fifth respondent was knowingly involved in the misleading or deceptive conduct of the first respondent, and entered judgment against the fifth respondent for damages to be assessed. 9 The hearing for the assessment of damages occurred on 17 May 2005 before Federal Magistrate McInnis.
 In some cases of deceit, it may also be proper to compensate the defrauded party not only for the difference between the value of the thing acquired and the price paid for it but also for losses induced by the fraud and directly incurred in conducting the business.
 The appellant did not produce evidence of the amount which the appellant undertook to pay in respect of each of the three vehicles under the novated arrangements entered into at the time of the purchase of the business, nor of the true value of the vehicles at that time.
 The Federal Magistrate did not err in rejecting the claim for those amounts. 42 The appellant also made a claim in respect of ongoing interest paid after the sale of the business in November 2003, on the outstanding balance of the loan taken out to purchase the business.
