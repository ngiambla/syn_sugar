 The Federal Magistrate found that the fifth respondent was knowingly involved in the misleading or deceptive conduct of the first respondent, and entered judgment against the fifth respondent for damages to be assessed. 9 The hearing for the assessment of damages occurred on 17 May 2005 before Federal Magistrate McInnis.
 The Federal Magistrate did not err in rejecting the claim for those amounts. 42 The appellant also made a claim in respect of ongoing interest paid after the sale of the business in November 2003, on the outstanding balance of the loan taken out to purchase the business.
