 1 The applicant has brought an application whereby he seeks damages from the respondent, which he initially identified as the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (the department), in the sum of $520,000, because the department "refused to help him get a job in Albany".
 The applicant never got to Albany and the job offer lapsed (see Pickering v Centrelink (2006) FCA 477). 4 The applicant claims that on the same day that Centrelink refused to advance him the money for a bus fare, he attended the department's premises and sought assistance from the department.
 In this regard it is significant that special leave to appeal to the High Court against the Full Court decision in Scott was refused, and the Scott decision has been followed recently by another Full Court in Wang v Minister, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] FCAFC 17.
