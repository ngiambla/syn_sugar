 Nor did they know whether the fourth respondent's further list of documents were additional documents in the possession of the fourth respondent over and above the documents set out in the earlier affidavit sworn on behalf of all respondents.
 The solicitors for the respondents replied on 1 June 2007 rejecting the request in various of the classes of specified documents and conceding others. 4 On 28 June 2007 the applicant filed a motion seeking discovery by each of the first, second, fourth and fifth respondents separately and particular discovery of specified documents or classes of documents.
 They also sought leave to further amend the statement of claim. 5 On 10 July 2007 I made orders on the motion giving leave to the applicant to amend its statement of claim in terms of the minute filed with the motion and giving the respondents leave to file amended defences by 31 July 2007.
