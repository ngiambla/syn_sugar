 The Smuggler told me that the man would go to Australia with me, and then he would return to Indonesia. ' 6 The Tribunal said 'in light of [the appellant] holding a valid Indonesian passport, the Tribunal has assessed her claims in relation to Indonesia'.
 In coming to that view, the Tribunal relied upon information recorded in that passport that the appellant had married an Indonesian citizen on 11 March 2004, that she divested herself of her Chinese citizenship and gained Indonesian citizenship on 18 March 2004.
 It also followed, according to the appellant, that statements in the Indonesian passport, to the effect, that she had lost her Chinese nationality and acquired Indonesian nationality, did not conclusively establish those facts because they were founded on the assumption that the marriage was a genuine marriage.
 The Tribunal acted on the evidence of the passport at face value, and concluded that it was 'validly' issued and, therefore, that it established conclusively that the appellant was an Indonesian national, and implicitly, a person to whom Indonesia would offer the protection that it would offer its nationals.
