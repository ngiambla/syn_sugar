 The High Court remitted the application to the Federal Court and on 9 February 2004, Emmett J refused the appellant's application for an order nisi. 7 Not deterred, the appellant then commenced on 19 April 2004, a further application for judicial review of the RRT's decision - this time in the Federal Magistrates Court.
 Accordingly, in my view, the question whether the appellant held the qualifying bridging visa, had to be assessed by reference to the position on 19 April 2004 --- being the date that the appellant made his application for judicial review to the Federal Magistrates Court.
 This is because it is clear that on the application of the proper test, namely, the date on which the appellant made his application for judicial review, namely, 19 April 2004, the appellant did not hold the qualifying bridging visa referred to in subcl 010.211(3)(c) - it being the fact that the appellant had last held such a qualifying bridging visa on 22 July 2002. 24 The appeal is dismissed with costs.
