 The respondent issued the amended assessment on the alternative footing that the sequence of transactions leading up to the sale to Terrence and Annette Walters constituted a scheme for the purposes of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the 1936 Act') and that each taxpayer had entered into the scheme for the dominant purpose of 'obtaining a tax benefit' in connection with the scheme.
 The tax benefit was said to be the avoidance or non-inclusion of an amount that would have been included in the assessable income of the taxpayer but for the taxpayer entering into or carrying out the scheme. 3 The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the respondent on the footing that the sequence of transactions was not a sham; each taxpayer intended the transactions to take effect according to their terms so as to bring about an uplift in the cost base of each share from $1.00 to $350,000.00 in the hands of the vendor of each share in the capacity of trustee of the relevant trust; the transactions had that effect; and the taxpayer did not incur a capital gain of $349,999.00 upon the sale of each share to Terrence and Annette Walters, subject to Part IVA of the 1936 Act.
 The applicants as directors of Adelong Hills passed resolutions that the company dispose of its right, title and interest in the Dart Trading share to Port Bracknell and in their capacity as directors of Port Bracknell, the applicants resolved to affix the company seal to the agreement and acquire the Dart Trading share in its capacity as trustee of the Dart Trust. 26 On 14 April 1999, David Walters as Principal under the Trust Deed for the Dart Trust exercised a power pursuant to clause 9.3.2 of the Trust Deed to remove Port Bracknell as trustee of the Dart Trust and personally assume the role of trustee of the Dart Trust.
