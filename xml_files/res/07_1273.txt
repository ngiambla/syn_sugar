 The purpose of refusing or cancelling a visa under section 501 is to protect the safety and welfare of the Australian community and to exercise a choice on behalf of the Australian community as a whole as to who should be allowed to enter or to remain in the community. 91 Direction 21 provides: 1.3 There are four grounds against which a non-citizen may be considered to not pass the Character Test under subsection 501(6).
 The first prerequisite is that the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test and the second is that the person does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test. [8] Even if those prerequisites are satisfied, the words "the Minister may cancel a visa" (emphasis added) indicate that there is still a discretion to be exercised by the Minister or his delegate as to whether or not to cancel a visa.
 In that form, the Minister was required to make a judgment as to whether or not the visa holder was not of good character because of the association with the person involved in criminal conduct. [11] The effect of the amendment was to remove any question of whether the Minister is satisfied as to the good character of a visa holder.
