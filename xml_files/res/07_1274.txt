 Whilst it did not deal expressly with s 424A(1)(b) , it made a number of general observations in respect of s 424A which demonstrate that the scope of the 'it' referred to in s 424A(1)(b) , namely the 'information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review' is limited.
 Once the Tribunal considered that the information contained in the appellant's passport issued to him on 15 July 2002 would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the Minister's Delegate's decision to refuse the appellant a protection visa, as it plainly did on or before 3 November 2006, it was obliged by s 424A(1)(a) of the Act to give to the appellant particulars of that information.
 Importantly, the Tribunal did not accept the appellant's explanation that there had been a mistake in the translation from the Nepali calendar to the Gregorian calendar which resulted in the timing of his father's alleged slaying having been incorrectly recorded in the appellant's visa application as having taken place at the end of 2001.
 It was open to the Tribunal to find, as it did, that the appellant's father was alive at the time of the issue of the passport and that he had not been killed by Maoists in the circumstances described by the appellant in his protection visa application before the passport was issued.
