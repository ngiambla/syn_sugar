 The motion is brought pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and O 20 r 5 and O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) ("the Rules"). 2 When the matter came on for hearing before me, Mr Walsh handed up a draft statement of claim setting out the bases on which he brought the application.
 Although it is important to bear in mind the difficulties which a litigant in person may have in placing proper pleadings before the Court, the draft statement of claim is not framed in a way which complies with the requirements of the Rules, nor does it appear to set out any intelligible cause of action known to the law.
 In that decision, his Honour examined carefully the relevant authorities concerning the dismissal of proceedings, the adequacy of a statement of claim as a proper proceeding, and the necessary elements of a claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
