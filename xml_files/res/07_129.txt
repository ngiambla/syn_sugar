 The period of 21 days expires today, 7 February 2007 because references in statutes to periods 'beginning on' or 'commencing on' a particular day or date, are calculated on the basis that that day or date is counted as the first day of the period: Darwin Broadcasters Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1990) 21 FCR 524 at 526-527; Watson v Uniframes Limited (1994) 55 FCR 556 at 560; Re Madden (1996) 131 FLR 430 at 432-434.
 Similarly, the 21 day period here began immediately on the expiration of 17 January 2007 and ends immediately before the beginning of 8 February 2007. 5 Mr Morgan's affidavit shows that he has conducted inquiries into the financial affairs of the five companies but needs more time in which to complete his task and to make an adequate report to the creditors. 6 Prior to Mr Morgan's appointment, the Yourhealth companies carried on the business of operating medical practices in Manly and Edgecliff in New South Wales, Camberwell in Victoria, and Carina in Queensland.
