 The claim will succeed unless: (a) one or more of the facts necessary to support the hypothesis are disproved beyond reasonable doubt; or (b) the truth of another fact in the material, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis, is proved beyond reasonable doubt, thus disproving, beyond reasonable doubt, the hypothesis'.
 In the opinion of the Board, to be reasonable, a hypothesis must possess some degree of acceptability or credibility --- it must not be obviously fanciful, impossible, incredible or not tenable or too remote or too tenuous.
