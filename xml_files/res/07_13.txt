 In the meantime, Highstoke sought from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) authority to make an application to the Court for the issue of a summons for the examination of a director of Hayes Knight in respect of its professional indemnity insurance cover to determine whether any judgment on the damages claim was likely to be satisfied.
 His Honour did, however, make an order that ASIC give discovery of documents relating to its decision: Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd v Australian Securities Investments Commission [2005] FCA 1509. 23 The applications by Hayes Knight in the Examination Proceedings and the Judicial Review Proceedings came on for hearing on 18 November 2005.
 In the present case however this aspect of the definition does not assist Highstoke as its authority from ASIC as an eligible applicant and the summons which issued on its application relate to the examinable affairs of Hayes Knight and not those of Performance Finance. 41 Section 596B provides for discretionary examination.
