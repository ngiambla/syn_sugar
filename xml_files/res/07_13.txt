 In the meantime, Highstoke sought from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) authority to make an application to the Court for the issue of a summons for the examination of a director of Hayes Knight in respect of its professional indemnity insurance cover to determine whether any judgment on the damages claim was likely to be satisfied.
 In the present case however this aspect of the definition does not assist Highstoke as its authority from ASIC as an eligible applicant and the summons which issued on its application relate to the examinable affairs of Hayes Knight and not those of Performance Finance. 41 Section 596B provides for discretionary examination.
