 1 The appellant taxpayer appeals from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Mr BH Pascoe, Senior Member) which affirmed an objection decision of the respondent Deputy Commissioner in respect of the 1997 and 1998 tax years: Re Taxpayer and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] AATA 750 ; (2006) 64 ATR 1075.
 But no record of either father or son was produced to confirm that or any other amount, except that the appellant did produce his own banking records and a credit card statement of his father as evidence of a total of $44,800 provided by his father on 8 July 1996. 8 The Tribunal at [12] was prepared to accept that $44,800 of the bankings represented funds provided by the father, but this left some $155,000 to be explained.
 While counsel for the Commissioner accepts that a question whether a finding was based on no evidence would be a question of law, the present case has to be considered in light of the onus of proof imposed on the taxpayer by s 14ZZK(b)(i) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).
