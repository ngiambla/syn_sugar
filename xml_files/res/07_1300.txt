 1 The appellant taxpayer appeals from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Mr BH Pascoe, Senior Member) which affirmed an objection decision of the respondent Deputy Commissioner in respect of the 1997 and 1998 tax years: Re Taxpayer and Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] AATA 750 ; (2006) 64 ATR 1075.
 The issues on the appeal concern the ascertainment of gross sales and the deduction of purchases in connection with a retail business carried on by the appellant. 2 Under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) an appeal lies to the Federal Court only on a question of law. 3 In October 1995 the appellant commenced a duty free retail business in Springvale, Victoria.
 But no record of either father or son was produced to confirm that or any other amount, except that the appellant did produce his own banking records and a credit card statement of his father as evidence of a total of $44,800 provided by his father on 8 July 1996. 8 The Tribunal at [12] was prepared to accept that $44,800 of the bankings represented funds provided by the father, but this left some $155,000 to be explained.
 While counsel for the Commissioner accepts that a question whether a finding was based on no evidence would be a question of law, the present case has to be considered in light of the onus of proof imposed on the taxpayer by s 14ZZK(b)(i) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth).
