 It is submitted, and I accept, that the critical matter in a case of this kind is that circumstances which would call for disclosure in the interests of purchasers, but which might not be caught by the continuous disclosure regime, which are called "excluded information", should be disclosed.
 That being the case, it is difficult to see that there is any substantial injustice to any party occasioned by regularising the situation save for the possibility that a purchaser may be able to prove that there was "excluded information" which should have been disclosed.
 I might say that the evidence is that the great bulk of, perhaps all of, the persons who received placements are what might be called professional or sophisticated investors.
 It gives liberty for a party, who claims to have suffered substantial injustice by reason of the orders, to apply to vary or discharge them within a limited period.
