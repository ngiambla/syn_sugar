 Prior to the Tribunal hearing on 7 March 2006, Mr Adewale Oladejo, of the law firm Koenig Simons, sent various statements and other documents to the Tribunal, including a document headed "Answers to Allegations of the Decision Maker".
 Amongst other things, this document contained statements denying that Mr Nguyen had said at interview that he and Ms Le had not lived with one another for some time, and affirming that Mr Nguyen had "felt somewhat pressured by the interviewing process".
 The Tribunal never heard their evidence. 11 The Tribunal's reasons recorded: "As there was insufficient time to take evidence from the remaining six witnesses, the review applicant's migration agent was invited to advise whether a further hearing would be required.
 It is plain enough that the Tribunal derived its account of the interview from the primary decision record and the typed notes of interview (as comparison with the Tribunal's summary of evidence demonstrates), but these sources apparently relied on the mistranslated version of Mr Nguyen's statement.
