 Second shipment : On or about 14 March 2007, Capital Steel shipped 476 lengths of each size of the pipe from Korea and on or about 30 March 2007 Capital Steel rendered tax invoice number 2381 for AUD4,133,114.77 (including GST) to Orrcon for purported delivery of the second shipment.
 On 14 March 2007, Capital Steel presented documents to Westpac purporting to draw on the letter of credit for the first shipment and on the same day and in reliance of the authenticity of the first shipment payment documents, Westpac issued Orrcon with a schedule of term drawing under documentary credit for AUD4,334,360.25 with a maturity date for payment to Capital Steel of 25 June 2007.
 The Commonwealth Bank has advanced a total of approximately $13,000,000 to Capital Steel. 95 The Commonwealth Bank asserts that it would not have made any of the payments but for its reliance on the Westpac letter of credit and the subsequent communications from Westpac that the necessary documents had been accepted and that it would remit payment.
 Furthermore, Orrcon instructed Westpac to accept the necessary documents under the letter of credit. 103 Another important consideration is the prejudice caused to Capital Steel and the Commonwealth Bank if an injunction restraining Westpac from making any payment under the Westpac letter of credit is made.
