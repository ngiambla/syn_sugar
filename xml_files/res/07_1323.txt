 Medical Evidence Issue 30 The Tribunal was satisfied that on 25 July 1991 Mr Samaras suffered a back injury at work, that in March 1995 he was diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depression and in March 1998 he was diagnosed with sarcoidosis affecting his lungs.
 In addition, the Tribunal was satisfied that he commenced full time employment with ATC and joined the Fund on 16 October 2002, that the last day of employment was 17 September 2003 when he was aged 40 and that his employment was terminated on that day. 31 The Tribunal first determined which illnesses were present in 2003 at the time that Mr Samaras ceased work with the ATC.
 As the Tribunal stated: "[Mr Samaras] provided over 100 pages of submissions in which he broadly argued that the Trustee and the Insurer chose irrelevant medical history and issues involving the relationship with his employer as the basis of their decision to decline his TPD application.
