 On that view, the motion before the Court is not, in itself, the exercise of appellate or related jurisdiction although it relates to an order made in the appellate or related jurisdiction.
 That is rather strained construction of the rule, and would appear to be contrary to the opinion of the Full Court in SZISM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 61 at [17] .
 The issue was considered on the basis that orders had not been entered and so O 35 r 7(1) was engaged ( Yevad [2005] FCAFC 263 ; 147 FCR 282 at [32] ---[33]).
