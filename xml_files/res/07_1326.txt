 The orders made were an exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to s 25(2B)(aa) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) and O 52 r 38 of the Federal Court Rules .
 On that view, the motion before the Court is not, in itself, the exercise of appellate or related jurisdiction although it relates to an order made in the appellate or related jurisdiction.
 That is rather strained construction of the rule, and would appear to be contrary to the opinion of the Full Court in SZISM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 61 at [17] .
 There is, thus, no rule concerning reopening of orders in the exercise of the appellate or related jurisdiction where the orders have been entered. 7 There has been controversy as to whether there is any implied power to set aside an order once entered.
 The Court referred to the decision of the High Court in DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 where the majority pointed out that there was no decision of the High Court that approved the reopening of final orders after entry ( DJL [2000] HCA 17 ; 201 CLR 226 at [44] ).
 The issue was considered on the basis that orders had not been entered and so O 35 r 7(1) was engaged ( Yevad [2005] FCAFC 263 ; 147 FCR 282 at [32] ---[33]).
 The application was considered on the assumption that there was power to reopen but the exceptional nature of that power was stressed and the application refused. 9 The issue was touched on in Wati v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 78 FCR 543 in the course of deciding whether an appeal lay from a single judge's refusal to extend time to institute an appeal.
 The authorities referred to that were said to support power to reopen an entered order, albeit in very limited circumstances, were Wentworth v Rogers (No 9) (1987) 8 NSWLR 388 per Kirby P at 394 and Haig v Minister Administering the National Parks Wildlife Act 1974 (1994) 85 LGERA (CA (NSW)) 143 per Kirby P at 153---154.
 The "appeal" was the exercise of original jurisdiction. 11 The order in this case is final in the sense that it ended the appeal once and for all.
 If there is a gap it should be filled by amendment of the Rules. 13 Even if there were power to set aside the orders of 9 February 2007, I would not do so.
 The first is that Mr Dunstan wishes to pursue an application for a retrial based upon fresh evidence as to documents which were not properly disclosed to him on discovery or otherwise in the course of the case.
 The support for such an application falls very far short of that which would be required to persuade a court to permit such an issue to be raised at this stage of a case on appeal.
 Mr Dunstan had ample notice prior to 6 November 2006 that the respondents were claiming that the notice of appeal was defective and he was then given a further three months to put it in order.
