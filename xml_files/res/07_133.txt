 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant. 2 The appellant applied for a protection visa on 25 June 1996 the grant of which was refused on 14 August 2003.
 The appellant replied in writing on 9 September 2005 and attached a number of documents, including an unsworn statutory declaration prepared by the appellant's former migration agent in July 1996. 5 The Tribunal found the appellant not to be credible.
 His Honour found that it was clear that the Tribunal was unaware of the July 1996 statement at the time of the hearing and that it was the appellant who had informed the Tribunal that he had made a statement in 1996.
