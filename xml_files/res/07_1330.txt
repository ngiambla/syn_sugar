 The evidence is that the only creditors of which there is any evidence have both acknowledged receipt of the notice of meeting and consent to and approve the regularisation of the matter.
 I might say that I am satisfied that s 1322 applies, notwithstanding the existence of s 447A. 3 The initial application was for a declaration of validity of the meeting which is to take place tomorrow.
 In any event, the application is now for orders extending the two relevant periods concerned to 16 August 2007, the effect of which will be that there will be no breach and there should, therefore, be no doubt about the validity of the meeting.
