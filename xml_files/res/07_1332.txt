 It would seem that a prospective purchaser would be required to construct a Rapid manufacturing plant to produce the product and the agency related to the sale of the plant itself.
 I would also note that the applicants propose to contend that there is an ambiguity in what "registration" means in this context and that the contract was varied by conduct for at least a period in 1999.
 Rapid Building India Pvt Ltd was not prepared to place an order for a plant with Rapid until they were assured of the contract for the construction of 16,000 schools in Gujarat.
