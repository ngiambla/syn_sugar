 The Applicant, in his own account, was released without charge and there is no evidence to suggest that the authorities considered their authority significantly threatened. 6 The Tribunal otherwise considered that the appellant's free use of his passport indicated that he was not of interest to the authorities at the time he left the PRC and the Tribunal considered that the account of bribery was implausible on the probabilities which the Tribunal member discussed.
 It is true, as Mr Zipser argued for the appellant, that, not having set out what the evidence was to support his finding against the appellant, it would be open to the Court to infer that there was no such evidence at all and consequent jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323.
 However, since I have the relevant part of the transcript it does not seem to me to be fair, in the circumstances of this particular case, to draw that inference (which in general, in the interests of transparency, courts should not be slow to draw). 9 A question arose as to whether, nevertheless, an order or injunction might go to the Tribunal member to cause him to comply with his obligation under s 430(1)(d) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to "refer to the evidence or ... other material on which the findings of fact were based".
 Even if the finding that he was not detained as claimed were legally objectionable, which as matters presently stand it appears to be, in such a case the question arises whether in its discretion a court should take any steps to remedy the legal deficiency identified. 13 SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 is authority for the proposition that a proper exercise of the discretion requires that relief should not issue in such circumstances.
