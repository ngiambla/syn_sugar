 The appellant contended that as the Tribunal's decision was not authorised by the Act, it was infected with jurisdictional error. 16 The appellant's case was that the protection visa application (Form 866) "was invalid".
 She argued that, in those circumstances, because of the effect of ss 45 and 46 of the Act and reg 2.07 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) (the Regulations), the appellant had not made a valid application.
 That form provides for a statutory declaration to be completed by the applicant. 30 The Minister contended that the failure of the appellant to complete the form did not mean that the application was not valid.
 No suggestion was made on behalf of the Applicant that he did not understand the nature of the application or that he did not have the capacity, even if he was under 18, to make an application for a protection visa.
