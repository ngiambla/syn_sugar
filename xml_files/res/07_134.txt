 1 This is an application dated 18 October 2006 for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from an order of a Federal Magistrate made on 14 August 2006.
 On that day the Federal Magistrate made an order dismissing the applicant's application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal which was signed on 21 December 2005 and handed down on 17 January 2006.
 Thirdly, the RRT did not consider it plausible that the applicant was detained and tortured by police and accused of co-operating in espionage with South Korea and while able to exit and enter Korea as often as the applicant had.
 His Honour found that the RRT had written to the applicant under provisions of s 424A of the Act and had set out why it had concerns about the credibility of the applicant's case.
