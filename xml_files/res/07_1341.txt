 I have already dealt with the costs of that Notice of Motion, and I am not disposed to treat the applicant's (unsuccessful) application for an adjournment as though it were a separate, free-standing, event within the proceeding.
 I agree that the applicant's conduct of her own case was inefficient, and that she devoted considerable time to pressing the respondents' witnesses for answers to questions which, if barely relevant, were not obviously calculated to advance her own case or to destroy that of the respondents.
 As against that, however, as will be apparent from my reasons for judgment given on 15 August 2007, there were very substantial gaps in the applicant's evidentiary case, and many areas with which she could have, probably should have, but did not, deal in cross-examination of the respondents' witnesses.
