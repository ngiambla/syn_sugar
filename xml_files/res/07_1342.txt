 However, the fact that: (a) a subsequent future act notice has been given that specifies all or part of an area that is included in the area covered by the application; and (b) paragraph (1)(d) is not satisfied in relation to each future act identified in the subsequent future act notice; is not, of itself, a compelling reason. (4) To avoid doubt, the Court's dismissal of an application under this section does not affect any rights, liabilities or obligations of a person under: (a) an agreement of the kind mentioned in paragraph 31(1)(b); or (b) a determination made under subsection 32(4) or section 36A, 38 or 42; or (c) an agreement made in accordance with, or a determination made under, any alternative provisions that are equivalent to the provisions mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b). (5) To avoid doubt, this section does not affect the Court's power to dismiss an application under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 .
 The Native Title Registrar providing advice under that section must tell the Federal Court Registrar: (a) that an application is a determination for native title in relation to an area --- this is a matter of fact; (b) that it is apparent from the timing of the application that it was made in response to a future act notice given in relation to land or waters wholly or partly within the area of the claim --- whilst this has the form of an opinion, it is established if conditions set out in s 94C(1A) are met.
 Importantly the Court is not required to proceed to consider mandatory dismissal of a native title determination application even where the facts set out in the Native Title Registrar's report are undisputed or otherwise made out. 11 Where the Native Title Registrar provides an advice under s 66C and the Court finds the facts set out in his advice, consideration of mandatory dismissal does not follow automatically.
