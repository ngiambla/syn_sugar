 The Federal Magistrate summarily dismissed the applicant's request to quash a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) made on 20 December 2006 and provided to the applicant on 11 January 2007. 2 Because the matter was summarily dismissed by the Federal Magistrate, leave to appeal is required.
 Moreover, the second Tribunal disregarded his conduct in becoming an active Falun Gong practitioner in Australia because it was not satisfied that the applicant had done so otherwise than to strengthen his claim to be a refugee, and so to be entitled to a protection visa under the Act.
 Because of that contrast and because by the time of the first Tribunal hearing the applicant said he had been practicing Falun Gong for some nine years, the second Tribunal concluded that the applicant had only become a Falun Gong practitioner after the first Tribunal hearing.
