 Given that factual finding, the second Tribunal was required by s 91R(3) of the Act to disregard the applicant's conduct of becoming a Falun Gong practitioner in Australia. 8 It is important to understand why the second Tribunal did not accept that the applicant had been a Falun Gong practitioner before he came to Australia.
 It did not direct his attention specifically to it planning to have regard to what he had told the first Tribunal about his knowledge of Falun Gong when considering his claim or to comment on that. 10 The applicant responded to that notice on 7 December 2006.
 Because of that contrast and because by the time of the first Tribunal hearing the applicant said he had been practicing Falun Gong for some nine years, the second Tribunal concluded that the applicant had only become a Falun Gong practitioner after the first Tribunal hearing.
