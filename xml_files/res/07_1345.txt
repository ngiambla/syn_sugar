 As pleaded in paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim, as it now stands, by an agreement dated 16 June 2005, and in consideration of licence fees paid by the applicant, Software agreed to grant the applicant a non-transferable and non-exclusive licence, numbered 13900099, to use various software systems known as "RWWAs/Natural/ADABAS Environment". 3 I will refer to the agreement as the "Licence Agreement" and to the software as the "System", which is how it is described in the pleading.
 His Honour was there considering amongst other things and relevantly for the purposes of the motion before me, the question of whether a pleading was capable of making out threats of infringement within the meaning of s 128(1) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (' Patents Act ' ). 9 It is accordingly relevant, by analogy, to the present case.
