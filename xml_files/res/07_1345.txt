 As pleaded in paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim, as it now stands, by an agreement dated 16 June 2005, and in consideration of licence fees paid by the applicant, Software agreed to grant the applicant a non-transferable and non-exclusive licence, numbered 13900099, to use various software systems known as "RWWAs/Natural/ADABAS Environment". 3 I will refer to the agreement as the "Licence Agreement" and to the software as the "System", which is how it is described in the pleading.
 The Statement of Claim at paragraph 7B is in the following terms: 'Further and in the alternative, the respondent has by its letter to the applicant dated 10 July 2006 further and alternatively by its letter to the applicant dated 2 September 2006. (I take that to be an error and I will read that as 12 September 2006). - further and alternatively by its letter to the applicant dated 16 October 2006, threatened the applicant with an action or proceeding in respect of an alleged infringement of copyright with respect to the applicant's making of the DR copy within the meaning of section 202(1) of the Copyright Act (1968). ' 4 There is a discrete issue as to whether those letters are admissible generally, because Software contends that they are protected from such use, they having been written on a 'without prejudice' basis.
 His Honour was there considering amongst other things and relevantly for the purposes of the motion before me, the question of whether a pleading was capable of making out threats of infringement within the meaning of s 128(1) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) (' Patents Act ' ). 9 It is accordingly relevant, by analogy, to the present case.
