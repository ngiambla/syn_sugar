 It is a step which precedes the institution of substantive litigation and is to some extent exploratory in nature. 6 Despite the narrower scope of pre-action discovery and the different questions to which it relates, an estimation of the strength of a prospective case including consideration of possible defences may be material.
 The focus of this form of discovery is on the question whether the requirements of O 15A r 6(a), (b) and (c) have been made out and, if so, whether the Court should exercise its discretion to require production.
 Any determination of an application for pre-action discovery must be made having regard to these considerations. 7 There is now no doubt that the Court has power to make an order that a Notice to Produce be issued in a pre-action discovery application if directed to the questions set out in O 15A r 6.
