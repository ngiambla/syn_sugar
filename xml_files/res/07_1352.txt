 Having regard to its terms and context, the meaning of the February 2007 resolution is, it seems to me, that orlistat should be removed from Appendix H because the Committee concluded that the potential for direct-to-consumer advertising to be misunderstood by consumers had been underestimated at the time of its previous decision.
 Roche drew attention to the reference in s 52E(1)(c) to "the potential hazards" and in s 52E(1)(g) to "the potential for abuse" and to the absence of the word "potential", or a similar word, in s 52E(1)(d) . 89 I reject the argument that the language of s 52E(1)(d) discloses a legislative intention that the Committee may not give consideration to the likely effect of an exercise of its powers under s 52D(2) on the extent and patterns of use of a substance.
 I conclude that these were matters that the Committee took into account in making its decision. 93 Roche submitted that it is self evident that any advertising has the potential to be misunderstood by consumers and that is no doubt why, in the context of therapeutic goods, the Code exists to supplement the more generally applicable TP Act .
