 In my opinion, that history is relevant. 6 Worimi's affidavit in support of this application does not differ in any substantial way in the characterisation and description of the native title rights and interests he asserts, from the evidence in support of the second claimant application, the subject of the decision in Worimi .
 Worimi on behalf of those persons, his mother, his sisters and their daughters now wishes to be joined to dispute the assertion by the Land Council that no native title exists with respect to the Land. 22 The reasons for summary dismissal of the previous claimant applications were based upon the requirements of the Act for a claimant application.
 Worimi acknowledges that the Worimi community and the women in particular are unaware of such rights or traditional laws and customs associated with the Land and do not observe any such laws and customs in connection with the Land.
