 The Tribunal acknowledges that some time ago Mr Jansen experienced serious side-effects from medication for depression/anxiety, and accepts that he may be reluctant to undergo similar treatment involving medication without an assurance from his treating doctor that there will be no serious side-effects.
 Consequently he cannot satisfy s 94(1) of the Act, and the Tribunal does not need to consider whether he had a continuing inability to work under s 94(1)(c) of the Act. " 15 Thus the decision of the Tribunal appears to have turned on a finding that Mr Jansen's condition had not been "fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised" because "further reasonable medical treatment (was) likely to lead to significant functional improvement within the next 2 years".
 If a person falls within par 6[d], his or her condition is to be taken as "stabilised" notwithstanding the absence of the "further reasonable treatment" specified in par 6[a] and [b]. 24 The Tribunal's emphasis on the lack of "grounds" indicates that it was treating the test as objective.
 This view of Dragojlovic is confirmed by what the Full Court said in Koutsakis . 25 In the Tribunal's reasons at [16] in the third sentence the expression "genuine reason" appears to be referring to the reason as being or not being real or authentic or well-founded, as distinct from the sincerity of the person himself.
