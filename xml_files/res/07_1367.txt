 It is put on behalf of the applicants that the matter is covered by authority and, in particular, the decision of O'Connor J in Finance Sector Union of Australia v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1999] FCA 59 ; (1999) 89 FCR 417, that decision having been referred to with approval by Tamberlin J in Sreika v Cardinal Financial Securities Limited [2000] FCA 1647.
 The respondent submits that the decision in Sreika [2007] FCA 1647 can be distinguished because the history of the proceeding was different, it having been intended to have been commenced as a representative proceeding --- it was, thus, simply a question of a wrong form being used. 3 It seems to me that the decision of O'Connor J is directly in point.
 If the point made by the present respondent is correct, and a proceeding is only commenced once, then I do not think that Sreika [2007] FCA 1647 can be distinguished in the way to which counsel for the respondent refers.
 That is not to say that Pt IVA is a complete code for the conduct of the case, but it is to say that a Pt IVA proceeding is sui juris and not to be joined with any other kind of proceeding.
