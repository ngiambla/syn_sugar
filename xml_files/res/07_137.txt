 It is unlikely that, in the refinancing, Ms Bell would have been able to persuade the Commonwealth Bank to release either her or Living It Up from liability to repay the amount borrowed, in favour of the other.
 In the words of Mr Chapman, in his affidavit of 10 June 2005, she had sold the business and was selling the Mariners Place property 'to take a break from work, downsize her house and spend more time with her daughter'.
 Ms Bell was quite prepared to accept the monthly payment of her living expenses, for which the order of 10 June 2005 allowed, rather than to take responsibility for her economic well-being and that of her children, by working.
