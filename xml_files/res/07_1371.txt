 The prayer for relief number 4 extends to the applicant's family. 29 The Notice of Motion filed by the six respondents on 20 September 2006 sought orders: 1 That the Applicant's proceeding against the Respondents be dismissed. 2 Alternatively, that the Applicant's proceeding be permanently stayed. 3 That the Applicant pay the Respondents' costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be taxed and paid forthwith. 30 Relevant to the proceedings in this matter on 5 December 2005 was the circumstance that there were relevant matters on foot in the New South Wales Supreme Court on 6 December 2005. 31 On 6 December 2005, despite the respondents agreeing by consent to the judgment of the New South Wales Supreme Court being set aside, there was no appearance by or on behalf of Mrs Rogers before the New South Wales Supreme Court on 6 December 2005.
 Those proceedings were adjourned to 12 December 2005. 32 On that day, Mr Rogers appeared before the New South Wales Supreme Court on behalf of his wife, and notwithstanding that counsel for the respondents advised the Court that the respondents consented to the judgment previously made in the New South Wales Supreme Court being set aside, Mr Rogers, on his wife's behalf, moved the Court for orders that Mrs Rogers' application be dismissed. 33 In consequence, on 12 December 2005, the New South Wales Supreme Court struck out Mrs Rogers' summons and ordered that she pay the respondents' costs of the hearing on 6 and 12 December 2005. 34 As noted above, this file was closed on 4 July 2006 because no action had been taken for six months.
 I have had regard to the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2006] FCA 434 and the reasons for judgment of Collier J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1708. 37 I have, in addition, had regard to two affidavits of Lynne Rogers filed on 19 September 2006, and the two affidavits of James Sean Whittle, a solicitor for the respondents, which was filed, in Court, on the hearing of the two motions. 38 Notwithstanding the voluminous material in the Statement of Claim, the concern of Mrs Rogers in these proceedings as at December 2005 was directed at obtaining orders in relation to property at Fingal in New South Wales, which had been the subject of orders of the New South Wales Supreme Court in the matter 5702/2005. 39 In the proceedings before me, Mrs Rogers alleged that the respondents were seeking to enforce an improperly obtained consent judgment and writ in respect of the Fingal property.
