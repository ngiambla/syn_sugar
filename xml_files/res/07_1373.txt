 In regard to the time of application criteria for the visa in clause 820.211, the issue of domestic violence is relevant only in relation to subclauses 820.211(8) and (9) ... the Tribunal finds the review applicant does not satisfy other requirements of the relevant subclauses 820.211(8) or (9), as the review applicant was the holder of a substantive visa at time of application and did not hold a Subclass 300 visa.
 There is, on such an application, always a temptation to reach a view as to the probable outcome of any proposed appeal. 33 I have referred, somewhat extensively, to the basis for the claim concerning whether the Tribunal's consideration of subsequent events meant that it had failed to address the right question, and, in particular, whether, in truth, the Tribunal's consideration of those later events were used by the Tribunal only to illuminate what was said by his Honour to be the equivocal or inconclusive nature of the evidence of cohabitation at the Woolloomooloo address, as Smith FM seemed to conclude. 34 There are, however, other possible arguable grounds on this application.
