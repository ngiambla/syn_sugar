 In regard to the time of application criteria for the visa in clause 820.211, the issue of domestic violence is relevant only in relation to subclauses 820.211(8) and (9) ... the Tribunal finds the review applicant does not satisfy other requirements of the relevant subclauses 820.211(8) or (9), as the review applicant was the holder of a substantive visa at time of application and did not hold a Subclass 300 visa.
 What was important, however, was that the Tribunal should only address evidence of later events to consider whether they confirmed the existence or otherwise at 27 July 2000 of a marriage in which the parties had "mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife" and a relationship which at that time was "genuine and continuing".
 The correctness of this finding, and whether the use of later events was only to illuminate the nature of the relationship at the time of the application is, in my opinion, at least arguable. 31 I have set out the history of the various steps in this litigation to provide the basis for my conclusion that the proposed appeal for which leave is sought is not unarguable. 32 The only question presently before the Court is whether leave to appeal should be granted.
 There is, on such an application, always a temptation to reach a view as to the probable outcome of any proposed appeal. 33 I have referred, somewhat extensively, to the basis for the claim concerning whether the Tribunal's consideration of subsequent events meant that it had failed to address the right question, and, in particular, whether, in truth, the Tribunal's consideration of those later events were used by the Tribunal only to illuminate what was said by his Honour to be the equivocal or inconclusive nature of the evidence of cohabitation at the Woolloomooloo address, as Smith FM seemed to conclude. 34 There are, however, other possible arguable grounds on this application.
