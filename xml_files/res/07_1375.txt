 The costs of these examinations were funded pursuant to the Agreement to Indemnify. 11 From about September 2004 and following the investigations, a draft statement of claim was prepared and Mr Stewart's then legal adviser (Mr Kramersh of Corrs Chambers Westgarth) commenced discussions with Seeley seeking an indemnity to pursue various causes of action.
 The general indorsement alleged that Mr Gjergja and Mr Tescher were both directors of Newtronics during specified periods and that each of them had, during those specified periods, breached his duties as a director of Newtronics. 13 On 27 March 2006, Seeley and Mr Stewart executed a Deed of Indemnity ("the Deed of Indemnity").
 Atco was served on the same day. 14 On 13 April 2006, administrators were appointed to Atco and the Promise of Support Action was stayed in accordance with s 440D of the Act . 15 On 10 July 2006, Seeley and Mr Stewart entered into a deed to vary the terms of the Deed of Indemnity ("the First Variation Deed").
 On 28 June 2007, orders were made for the provision of security for the benefit of one of the directors, Mr Gjergja. 17 On 1 December 2006, Mr Stewart filed an application in the Promise of Support Action seeking leave to proceed against Atco (a company then in liquidation) and seeking leave to add Newtronics' receivers as defendants to the proceeding.
