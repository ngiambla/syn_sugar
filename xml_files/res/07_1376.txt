 In May 2007, he commenced employment with Klen Group. 3 On 22 June 2007, the applicant commenced a proceeding against the respondents seeking to restrain the third respondent from committing breaches of his employment contract with the applicant; and from making use of, or disclosing the confidential information of the applicant.
 In that proceeding, the applicant also seeks relief restraining the first and second respondents from, in general terms, inducing the third respondent to breach his employment contract with the applicant, and from using, or inducing the third respondent to disclose the applicant's confidential information, or from benefiting from such disclosure or use of confidential information.
 It is also significant that the third respondent declines to continue his undertaking not to breach cl 6 of the employment agreement; and opposes the grant of the interlocutory injunction. 60 Accordingly, in my view, there is on the evidence, a serious question to be tried that the applicant will obtain at trial an injunction restraining the third respondent from soliciting, or attempting to solicit, or assisting in soliciting business from customers of the applicant in breach of cl 6 of his employment contract.
