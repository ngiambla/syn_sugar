 The proper process is to appeal against it and that she has done. 9 The second order is that: "The fourth respondent pay the applicant damages in the sum of $50. " That is an order that works in favour of the applicant.
 The terms of that order is, at this point of time, a matter of speculation and it is not appropriate to indulge in speculation. 12 The applicant puts her case for a stay in respect of the costs order on a number of bases.
 Before I turn to those bases I have formed the view that it is not an appropriate case to grant a stay against an order that simply directs that the parties file and serve submissions and submissions in reply on questions of costs.
 I do not consider that the proper administration of justice is interfered with if a stay is not granted and I do not see any basis on which the stay is necessary for the proper administration of justice.
