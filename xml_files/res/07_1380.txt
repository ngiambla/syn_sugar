 It described the hypothesis in its reasons for decision at [3]: As a result of her husband's fear or phobia of doctors and hospitals arising from his experience in Japan, he failed to obtain and receive adequate and appropriate medical advice for his lymphoma. 15 The Tribunal considered that there was material pointing to that hypothesis which connected the death with war service.
 There is no SoP for a phobia. 22 The reference to a change of emphasis on the hypothesis raised is the correct way of considering the gloss placed by Mrs Gittins' legal representative on the hypothesis, the subject of SoP No 37 of 2003.
 The so-called second hypothesis was not really a hypothesis at all but an alternative way of stating the first hypothesis. 23 Further, the Federal Magistrate was correct in stating that there was only one cause of death.
