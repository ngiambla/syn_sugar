 1 On 28 March 2006, the plaintiffs commenced proceedings in this Court seeking damages in the order of $37,000 plus interest and costs against seven defendants arising out of damage to a cargo of polished black granite from the port of Liudu in Yunfu in China to Sydney.
 We undertake to obtain such an order by Consent through his Honour's Associate if you agree to this. 23 On 19 February 2007, Ms Lazarou confirmed by email to Mr Harb that Bowport had provided all documentation in its possession. 24 On 20 February 2007, the first, third, fourth and seventh defendants again offered a discontinuance without costs.
 The parties should have settled; to do so for the kinds of figures discussed in March would have reflected the hard fought, but ultimately reasonable, way in which the case had been approached by all parties.
