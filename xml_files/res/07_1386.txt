 INTRODUCTION 1 This is an application for a determination of native title under s 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) in respect of an area (the claim area) described in the application, comprising various allotments in the town of Tennant Creek.
 The report also notes particular instances in current times of both junior and senior members of the native title claim group continuing to observe customary rights and interests within the context of everyday practices and ceremonial occasions. 18 The material relied upon by the parties in support of the proposed consent determination, in my view, adequately addresses (inter alia) the requirements of ss 223 and 225 of the Act and the appropriateness of making the proposed consent determination.
 The Corporation is a body corporate which may be determined under s 56 to hold the rights and interests in trust for the common law holders (see s 59 of the Act and r 4 of the Native Title Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 ).
