 That is a rather crude summary of the situation but is sufficient to understand what is at stake. 2 Prior to the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff provided me with comprehensive written submissions, which incorporate a schedule which summarises the disclosure requirements of an information memorandum for a share scheme and shows what the obligations are and where the information memorandum picks them up.
 I will mark the outline of submissions for identification number 1 and I will direct that they remain with the papers and should be available for inspection by any interested party. 3 I have been taken carefully through the scheme documents themselves and, subject to one matter, I have no difficulty with them.
 As counsel has said, clauses along those lines have been approved or have been included in schemes approved in recent times by judges of this Court, the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court of Queensland, albeit misgivings or doubts having been expressed about the effect of such a clause (eg Mincom Ltd v EAM Software Finance Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] QSC 207 at [20] ---[29]).
 Even if a draconian view were taken about that clause, it is hardly fundamental to these transactions in particular, because they are not at arm's length with parties that might be in contention, but, rather, they represent an internal restructure. 4 I have been taken carefully through the information memorandum and to the material which backs that memorandum including the expert report and the underlying advices which are directed to two topics of significance.
