 This is of no little importance. 7 All five respondents in the above Federal Court proceedings sought to have the application struck out as vexatious or an abuse of process or to have it summarily dismissed on the basis that it had no reasonable prospects of success: see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 31A.
 As I indicated in my judgment in the strike out proceedings, unless and until the costs order is set aside, it is simply not open to Mr Cirillo to make the claim he seeks to make founded on the tort of abuse of process claiming damages in respect of costs incurred in the inquiry as to damages proceeding.
