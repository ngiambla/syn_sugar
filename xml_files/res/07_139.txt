 The effect of this was said to be that CAL had in consequence not disclosed that it had no right to defend the inquiry as to damages proceedings at least on the basis that it had a set-off against Mr Cirillo's claims by virtue of its secured debt which was in turn supported by a personal guarantee by Mr Cirillo.
 This is of no little importance. 7 All five respondents in the above Federal Court proceedings sought to have the application struck out as vexatious or an abuse of process or to have it summarily dismissed on the basis that it had no reasonable prospects of success: see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 31A.
 The principal basis of my so doing was that, for as long as the Supreme Court costs order stood, the principal of finality embodied in the doctrine of res judicata precluded an examination of the incidents of costs albeit indirectly in a tort action such as foreshadowed in the then present statement of claim.
 As I indicated in my judgment in the strike out proceedings, unless and until the costs order is set aside, it is simply not open to Mr Cirillo to make the claim he seeks to make founded on the tort of abuse of process claiming damages in respect of costs incurred in the inquiry as to damages proceeding.
