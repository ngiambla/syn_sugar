 For present purposes it is sufficient for me to refer to the decision of Debelle J in Centrestate Exports Pty Ltd v Amarantos Shipping Co Ltd [2005] SASC 158 where, after considering the authorities that had been traversed in recent case law, his Honour said (at para 32) of the discretion to grant leave: "The overriding consideration is the interests of justice.
 It is plainly necessary to have regard to all relevant factors including the nature and importance of the admission, the circumstances in which the admission was made, whether the admission was made deliberately or inadvertently, the reason given for the application to withdraw, the detriment or prejudice which might be caused to the other party and the stage which the proceedings have reached, and whether the admission is contrary to the facts.
 The list of relevant factors affecting the Court's decision will plainly vary from case to case. " 5 Given the subject matter of the admission (which involves the acceptance of an asserted characterisation of what was said), it would have taken little to induce me to grant the leave, the more so as the primary facts upon which the implication is said to arise would have to be proved in any event by the ACCC in this proceeding. 6 The ACCC opposes the grant of leave largely on the basis of what it asserts is (i) the unsatisfactory nature of the affidavit put on by Mr Lancsar's legal adviser to explain the reasons why leave is sought; and (ii) correspondence between its own lawyers and Mr Lancsar's legal adviser concerning the admissions generally made by Mr Lancsar.
