 In a statutory declaration relied on by the Opponent, Mr Van Niekerk said that, since approximately September 2003, his company has " commercialised ' goods in Australia under the trade marks " Avene " and " Eau Thermale Avene ".
 He says that " the mark is applied to a wide range of personal care goods " and that the range of products has been substantially and continually available since his company began " commercialising " the products in 2003.
