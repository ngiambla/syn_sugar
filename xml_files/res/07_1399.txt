 1 By application filed on 3 September 2007 the applicant, Ms Marie Ashdown, seeks leave pursuant to s 58(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') to take fresh steps in and to continue with Supreme Court of New South Wales Equity Division proceedings no. 3897 of 2006 ('the Supreme Court proceedings').
 Accordingly it is necessary for leave to be granted to enable Ms Marie Ashdown, through the Protective Commissioner, to continue with the Supreme Court proceedings. 5 The affidavit of Mr Christopher Matthew Zucker sworn 3 September 2007 attaches the existing Statement of the Claim in the Supreme Court proceedings, and the proposed Amended Statement of Claim.
 It is not necessary to consider in detail the claims made on behalf of Ms Marie Ashdown against each of the three defendants namely Mr Spargo, Wygoss Pty Limited and Mr Prior except to observe that there are allegations of undue influence in relation to the mortgages granted to Wygoss Pty Limited, unconscionable conduct, a claim for relief under the Contracts Review Act 1980 (NSW), and a claim for relief for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty.
 The Court is satisfied that for the purposes of s 58(3)(b) of the Act the claim the subject of the Supreme Court proceedings falls within the purview of s 82 and that the Supreme Court proceedings are in respect of a provable debt.
