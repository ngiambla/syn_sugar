 The FMC application, broadly, concerned the question of whether Mr Pascoe was validly appointed as Trustee of the Estate and whether the procedures subsequently adopted by him by which he objected to the discharge of Mr Hudson from bankruptcy were effective.
 On 10 August 2007 Wilson FM determined in Hudson v The Official Trustee Ors [2007] FMCA 1357 that the Trustee was validly appointed and that the procedure by which he objected to the discharge of Mr Hudson from bankruptcy was effective.
 The evidence is that those moneys are due to Mrs Hudson as part of a settlement on her divorce from Mr Hudson, by reason of a miscalculation when the amount due was translated from New Zealand dollars to Australian dollars. 6 The affidavit of the Trustee sets out in some detail the matters supporting the proof of debt of Mrs Hudson and also the details of the costs and disbursements and remuneration due to the Trustee as part of the administration of the bankruptcy.
 I order that the moneys presently held by the Trustee be released to the Trustee and that the Trustee have leave to distribute the sum of $56,617.50 received by him in accordance with the Act. 9 As the notice of appeal has been filed from the decision of Wilson FM and as it is by no means clear that Mr Hudson intends or has intended to apply for a stay, I will stay the order releasing the moneys to the Trustee for a period of 14 days.
