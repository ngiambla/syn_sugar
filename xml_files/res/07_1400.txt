 The FMC application, broadly, concerned the question of whether Mr Pascoe was validly appointed as Trustee of the Estate and whether the procedures subsequently adopted by him by which he objected to the discharge of Mr Hudson from bankruptcy were effective.
 The evidence is that those moneys are due to Mrs Hudson as part of a settlement on her divorce from Mr Hudson, by reason of a miscalculation when the amount due was translated from New Zealand dollars to Australian dollars. 6 The affidavit of the Trustee sets out in some detail the matters supporting the proof of debt of Mrs Hudson and also the details of the costs and disbursements and remuneration due to the Trustee as part of the administration of the bankruptcy.
