 That application was refused on 15 September 2006 by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (MIC).
 The appellant then applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) for review of the delegate's decision.
 He did not tell the Tribunal why his parents did not complain to the police about stone-throwing at their house.
 The appellant complained that the Tribunal had emphasised irrelevant questions in the oral evidence and ignored his political profile.
