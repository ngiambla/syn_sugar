 For example, I refer to Mr Livanis' evidence (par [5] above) that Australian authorities had informed him that: "... they had information that Samsonidis and his network were preparing or had prepared a factory in Australia for the production of synthetic drugs such as amphetamines and methamphetamines. " 36 As noted in par [24] above, s 67 of the TIA Act allows the AFP to communicate to another person lawfully intercepted information for a "permitted purpose" which includes "a purpose connected with an investigation by the [AFP] of a prescribed offence".
 He submitted that the AFP had to establish that the communication was for a proper purpose and that there was a shift in the evidentiary burden having regard to the information available to the AFP and what the evidence disclosed. 38 I do not accept the submission that if the purpose of the communication was for a foreign purpose it was an improper purpose.
 There was also enclosed the authorisation signed by the Minister for Justice and Customs pursuant to s 13 of the Mutual Assistance Act referred to in par [15] above). 50 It was not open to the Minister to authorise the provision of that material pursuant to s 13A of the Mutual Assistance Act, as material obtained under the TIA Act was expressly excluded from the definition of the material which could be provided under that section.
 It is apparent from the request for assistance from Greece that it required confidentiality to be applied to its request and to the evidence provided. 55 Such confidentiality could not have been maintained if the Magistrate or the Attorney-General were obliged to inform the applicant of the request or invite his participation in the Mutual Assistance Act s 13 proceeding.
