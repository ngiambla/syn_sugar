 The decision of the Tribunal whereby the Tribunal set aside the decision of the Veterans' Review Board made on 22 November 2005 and decided "that the death of the late Mr Charles Sergeant is war-caused within the meaning of s 9 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 " be set aside. 2.
 Further, a relevant hypothesis must consist of a link or links which connect, at one end, the type of death suffered by the Veteran, which is the basis of the claim under the Act , with, at the other end, the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the Veteran: McKenna 86 FCR at 151.
 This was conceded by the respondent. 10 I note that the Tribunal in its decision referred to these Statements of Principles as relevant to a hypothesis connecting the death of the Veteran to the circumstances of the case, and found that in this respect the second Deledio step was satisfied (Tribunal decision at [41]).
 Accordingly, having regard to the links contained in the hypothesis advanced before the Tribunal in addition to the three Statements of Principle already mentioned, it was also necessary for the Tribunal to have regard to the Statements of Principles concerning anxiety disorder (Instrument No 1 of 2000) and panic disorder (Instrument No 9 of 1999).
