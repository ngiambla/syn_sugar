 The Applicants allege in the Statement of Claim that, as a result of the Works, the Licence was liable to cancellation and the continued operation of the Hospital business exposed the current Directors of Peninsula to personal liability.... 16.
 In particular, they deny that the Works were in breach of or threatened the Hospital Licence or were in breach of [the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)] or threatened the continued operation of the Hospital business or that closure of the Hospital business was as a consequence of any matters arising from the Works or an absence of consent or authorisation of those Works related to the Works. 18.
 PRIMA FACIE CASE 9 In order to make out a prima facie case an applicant must establish that there is evidence which is sufficient to support its allegations and which will stand and lead to judgment in its favour unless there is evidence which rebuts the allegations.
 In light of this conclusion, there is no need for me to consider at length whether there is a danger of the respondents disposing of or removing their assets so that a prospective judgment may not be fully satisfied.
