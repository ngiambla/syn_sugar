 The appellant also submitted that SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 ( SZBEL ) supported her contention that on a proper construction of ss 425, 425A, 426 and 426A of the Act, the Tribunal is required by s 425(1) to issue an invitation to the hearing before there can be any "valid" consent under s 425(2)(b). 20 In my view, the appellant's contentions are not to be accepted. 21 One of the amendments introduced by the Amending Act makes provision in s 425(2)(b) for an applicant to consent to the Tribunal deciding the review without the applicant appearing before it.
 The Full Court decided that there was no absolute right to a hearing before the Tribunal member who makes the review decision, and that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error by not inviting the applicants to a second hearing. 23 The appellant is correct in her contention that Liu is distinguishable on the facts from this case.
 Further, the case is not authority for the proposition advanced by the appellant that, on a proper construction of the Act, it is necessary for the Tribunal to issue an invitation to a hearing before there can be a "valid" consent under s 425(2)(b). 25 Accordingly, ground 1 of the appeal is dismissed. 26 Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal are also dismissed for the reasons given by the Federal Magistrate.
