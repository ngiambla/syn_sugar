 It does not follow that because there is no absolute right to a second hearing when a matter is remitted to the Tribunal for hearing according to the law, that there will never be circumstances when the Tribunal will be required to invite an applicant to a second hearing, in order to comply with s 425(1).
 In the case of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 ; (2003) 215 CLR 518 ( Wang ), the High Court considered the validity of a direction made by the Full Federal Court on appeal remitting a matter to the Tribunal as previously constituted, with the object of preserving the findings of fact that had been made by the Tribunal that were favourable to the applicant.
