 Moreover TV Plus asserted that although it was said by UBI to have been acknowledged by TV Plus that there had been an earlier rejection by JRTS of any subsisting contractual obligation on its part in favour of TV Plus , nevertheless that any such rejection had occurred otherwise than within the terms of the TV Plus/JRTS contractual arrangements, and had not been in fact accepted by TV Plus .
 In that regard, TV Plus asserted that no payment was due and payable under that TV Plus/JRTS agreement during the first six months of its term, yet the purported termination by Mr Hadzijamakovic on behalf of JRTS took place before the end of that six months period. 53 The foregoing circumstances propounded by TV Plus were therefore said by TV Plus to provide a firm basis for its asserted continuing belief that TV Plus was entitled to take the broadcast signals from JRTS originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to distribute the same in Australia, and that accordingly the representation said to arise from the conduct of TV Plus was not misleading.
 It would be seemingly inappropriate to the exercise of the Court's discretion in its favour in the somewhat unique context presently prevailing, if not also inequitable, on the present state of the evidence, for TV Plus to gain the benefit of security for its costs provided by its Australian competitor UBI , in circumstances where it has withheld, at least for the time being, from joining to the proceedings the very entity from whom it claims controversially to derive its source of broadcasting entitlement or authority.
 In that regard, the present state of the evidence is that JRTS has maintained the position (and has done so in the context of its comprehensive affidavit material) of denial of any present entitlement, contractual or otherwise, of TV Plus to broadcast the television signals of JRTS in Australia, and for TV Plus to seek to do so to the competitive detriment of UBI as JRTS's asserted exclusive appointee in Australia.
