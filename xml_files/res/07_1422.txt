 On 30 November 2005 the Full Court allowed an appeal, ordered that the orders made on 27 April 2005 should be set aside and remitted the matter to me for reconsideration ( Kamha v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] FCAFC 248 ; (2005) 147 FCR 516).
 I will assume a familiarity with the history and circumstances of the case, the statutory background and the prior judgments in framing these reasons. 2 On 9 June 2006 counsel for the applicant submitted that the reconsideration is limited to consideration of the applicant's grounds of attack upon the decisions in question that were not dealt with in my prior judgment on their merits.
