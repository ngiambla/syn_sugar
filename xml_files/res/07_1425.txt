 During the course of the discussion Mr Vasilli Karellas said to the union organiser words to the effect of: '... we have circulated a letter this morning to all staff confirming that they will get a 5% wage increase. ' Mr Karellas proceeded to leave the union organiser at the coffee shop returning approximately five minutes later with a single page document which he handed to the union organiser.
 Thus, whilst s 82 is concerned with the recovery of an amount representing the loss or damage, s 87 is concerned with compensation, whether in whole or in part, for loss or damage and with the reduction of loss or damage, and with the prevention of loss or damage which is likely to be suffered.
 In order to establish a causal link between the contravention of s 341(1) of the Act and Karellas employees becoming saddled with the 2007 Agreement in this case, evidence would be required from employees of Karellas who voted to approve the agreement indicating that had it not been for one or other of the misrepresentations contained in the four page document or the three page document put around by Karellas, they would not have voted as they did. 117 In the absence of any evidence on the issue, the Court may not make an order declaring the 2007 Agreement void.
