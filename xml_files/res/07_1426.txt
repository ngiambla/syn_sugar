 The Commissioner also contended that a sale of land at Gladstone by the Carringbush Trust (said by the taxpayer to give rise to a capital gain) was profit derived on revenue account and secondly, that Part IVA of the 1936 Act relevantly applied entitling the Commissioner to make a particular determination under s 177F(1)(a) of the 1936 Act.
 If an extension is granted and the trustee makes an election (or the relevant taxpayer makes an election; s 160V(1) of the 1936 Act) resulting in a disposal at a material date , those events may result in the amended assessment of 25 November 2005 for the year ending 30 June 2001 being further amended by the Commissioner.
 Alternatively, if the Commissioner's decision is unfavourable to each taxpayer, the appellants seek an Order that that decision form part of the respondent's objection decision and that a contended error in refusing to grant an extension, be the subject of a further amendment to the grounds of objection of each taxpayer, with leave.
 There is no proper basis for joining in the adjudication of the questions alive on appeal a question going to the Commissioner's consideration of a request by the trustee of the Carringbush Trust nor a consideration of whether the Commissioner erred in making an administrative decision to either grant or refuse the trustee's application for an extension.
