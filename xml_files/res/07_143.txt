 The Tribunal found that the applicant's evidence that, during this period he had at times been unemployed, been in prison and been engaged in casual work was contradicted by information provided by the Secretary of the Indo-Australian Chamber of Commerce and by statements made in the applicant's visa application.
 His grounds included claims that the decision was not made in good faith; that there had been breaches of the rules of natural justice; that the Tribunal did not consider the reasonableness of relocation; the use of adverse information by the Tribunal; that the Tribunal failed to give proper and adequate reasons; that the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction; and that the Tribunal failed to consider all claims and issues. 5 The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application under r 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules ('the Rules') as there was no arguable case raised.
