 The offers were contained in offer documents sent to ordinary debenture holders on 9 November 2005 and 16 and 29 January 2007 and to cumulative debenture holders on 8 and 23 November 2005 and 22 January 2007. 5 The plaintiff, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, alleges that the offers did not comply with Division 5A of Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
 The only issues in dispute are whether the offer documents contained "a fair estimate of the value of the [debentures] as at the date of offer" and an explanation of the basis upon which each estimate was made, as required by s 1019I(2)(c). 8 The offer price for ordinary debentures was 2.15c, 3.05c and 3.05c respectively.
 As regards the cumulative debentures, Mr McGrath said that a fair estimate of their value was between 99.2 and 120.8 cents (on each of 8 November 2005 and 23 November 2005) and between 100.9 and 123.0 cents on 22 January 2007.
