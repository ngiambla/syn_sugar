 The first appellant relevantly claimed to have converted to Christianity prior to arriving in Australia and, consistent with his conversion, to have practised Christianity consistently since his arrival in Australia. 14 The Tribunal referred to s 91R(3) of the Act in its summary of the ' RELEVANT LAW ' before proceeding to a consideration of the appellant's ' CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE'.
 It is important, however, to note the High Court's observation concerning the obligation of the Tribunal to accord procedural fairness to applicants for review, notwithstanding what some may have thought to be a limitation contained in s 422B of the Act. 19 Proceedings before the Tribunal are not adversarial, but inquisitorial; the Tribunal is not in the position of the contradictor of the case being advanced by an applicant.
