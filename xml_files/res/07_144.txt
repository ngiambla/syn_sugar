 1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC") commenced a proceeding in the Court alleging that IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (formerly known as Edison Mission Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd ("Edison") and the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia ("the CEPU") had contravened various provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act ").
 It was alleged that, in 2001, Edison and the CEPU agreed that Edison would not engage the services of any electrical contractor to perform work at the Loy Yang B power station unless that contractor had entered into a certified agreement with the CEPU.
 Having heard further submissions relating to the quantum of penalty and costs his Honour, on 16 January 2007, ordered that the CEPU pay a penalty of $125,000 and costs of $200,000: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2007] FCA 11.
