 The relevant inquiry as described by Jacobson J consists of two aspects, which need to be addressed separately, and to the extent the federal magistrate treated both aspects together, in my respectful view he fell into error. 18 However, I turn first to the preliminary matter as to whether the Notice substantially complied with the requirements of the form prescribed by the Regulations.
 In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to "the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute. " 26 The High Court then considered whether the defect constituted a breach of an essential requirement of the Act (at [28]-[30]) (footnotes omitted): The other exclusionary aspect of the expression "a formal defect or an irregularity" in s 306 was said to consist in a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act.
 His Honour considered the decision of Kenny J in American Express International Inc v Held [1999] FCA 321 ; (1999) 87 FCR 583 where her Honour found that failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice was a breach of an essential requirement of the Act.
 At [11], North J held that even though there was no precise analogy between the purpose for which the copy judgment is required by the form, and the purpose for which the interest calculation is required, the interest calculation was nevertheless an essential requirement of the Act.
