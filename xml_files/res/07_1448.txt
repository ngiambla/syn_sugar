 INTRODUCTION 1 The applicants (other than South Johnstone Mill Limited ('the Company')) seek leave to continue this proceeding on behalf of and in the name of the Company under s 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ('the Act'), seeking injunctive relief and damages for contravention of various sections of the Act and damages on other grounds in respect of the sale of the Company's milling assets.
 I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence, which is not objected to, demonstrating that there is a serious question to be tried (which impacts upon my consideration of the best interests of the Company) that there was a sale at undervalue at least in respect of the sale of the Company's shares in sugar industry-related companies.
 The Receivers also pointed to the fact that the proposal was highly dependent upon a number of factors including external funding and support from the government to assist with working capital requirements. 95 As already mentioned, on 9 February 2001, Tully wrote to the Receivers explaining their interest in negotiating the acquisition of the sugar industry-related shares.
