 She sent further letters vehemently denying the allegations and provided her version of the events. 25 On 4 June 2004, Ms Bahonko filed an application with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ('VCAT') for review of the NBV's decision of 24 May 2004 to suspend her registration.
 A letter was written to Ms Bahonko explaining the NBV's decision to continue the investigations and the suspension of her registration. 27 Ms Bahonko claimed she was told by the NBV's investigator, Ms Miln, that the NBV would lift her suspension, but due to her not signing some papers, this did not occur.
 She claimed that anything positive and to her benefit is consistently refused by the respondents and the State of Victoria. 89 Ms Bahonko also raised claims against the respondents under the Equal Opportunity Act 1995 (Vic) for alleged discrimination on the basis of impairment, political beliefs or activity, race and religious belief and activity.
 Conclusions Scope of the proceeding 90 I accept the respondents' submissions that in so far as Ms Bahonko alleged that the respondents discriminated against her on the basis of her political opinions and religious beliefs, those claims are not within the jurisdiction of this Court in this proceeding.
