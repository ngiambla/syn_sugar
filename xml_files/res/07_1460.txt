 The relief sought is that Mr Roberts be reinstated in his previous position as a Permanent Level 5 Supervisor and that he be compensated by the Club for the loss of wages suffered by him between termination and reinstatement.
 Mr Roberts applied unsuccessfully for the new position of Chef de Partie. 11 On about 10 October 2006 Mr Nairne spoke to Mr Roberts in the presence of Prakash Osborne who then held the position of Executive Chef.
 Mr Roberts made arrangements for his aunty, Ms Paterson, (I adopt Mr Roberts' spelling of his aunty's name) to attend the meeting as a witness. 14 At about 2:45 pm that day Mr Roberts was handed a letter by Mr Nairne.
