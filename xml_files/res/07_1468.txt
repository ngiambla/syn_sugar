 Finally, the claim between the applicants and Landmark appeared to be much closer to trial than any of the cross-claims. 23 Landmark and various cross-respondents opposed the applicants' notice of motion. 24 On 11 January 2007, Australian Premium Seeds filed an affidavit sworn by a solicitor employed by the firm of solicitors representing it.
 It was submitted that it was at least arguable that each of the parties could be found to have caused the loss claimed by the applicants and that the liability of Landmark and each cross-respondent would need to be determined by the Court by comparing the extent of each party's responsibility for the loss or damage suffered by the applicants.
 Selected Seeds' application should be granted in preference to that of Mr Michael Gargan because its application was the first in time and, more importantly, its proposed defence does not contain a plea as to the proportionate liability provisions which I have concluded is not arguable.
