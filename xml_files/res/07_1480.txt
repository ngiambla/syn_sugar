 It is not in dispute that the ecological community known as the White Box - Yellow Box - Blakely's Red Gum grassy woodlands and derived native grasslands (the " White Box native grasslands community") has been listed in the critically endangered community.
 The White-Box Grassy Woodlands community covers a very broad geographical distribution, such that its characteristic species list may not be highly indicative of the nature of the community where it occurs at the margins of its ranges, such as in the Upper Hunter Valley.
 This difference also weighs against the submission that the decision involves a determination of a jurisdictional fact. 72 While there is no authority directly in point the approach of the Full Court in Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24 impliedly accepted that the Minister's determination was not subject to merits review by the Court.
