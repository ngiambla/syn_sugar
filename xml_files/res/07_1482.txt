 The return does not indicate that the deceased owned any overseas assets. 5 During the administration of the estate the executors located copies of correspondence which referred to foreign investments apparently owned by the deceased and to a Swiss bank account in her name as a reference was made to a copy of a letter written by the deceased to Lombard Odier and Cie, Geneva Switzerland ('Lombard').
 The document was signed by the deceased in Mosman on 17 March 2000. 6 On 3 April 2007 Richard Arthur Schmidt, the applicants' solicitor wrote to Teece Hodgson Ward, solicitors for the respondent, seeking details of several share transactions which were made by the respondent for the deceased in the period 1 July 2000 until the date of death of the deceased.
 However by letter dated 3 May 2000 a copy of a letter was forwarded to Mr Schmidt which recorded that Vernes Gestion of Geneva had opened a bank account on 21 February 2000 in the name of the deceased. 7 Based upon such information Mr Schmidt sought details of an amount of $500,000 believed by him to have been deposited into that account.
