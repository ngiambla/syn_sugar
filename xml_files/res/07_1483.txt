 The payments made to Entcorp were paid over a sixteen week period in the amount of $11,846.15 per week, which is said to be approximately $2,000 per week in excess of the amount permitted to be paid pursuant to Order 2 made by Emmett J.
 I am satisfied that, as a consequence of this application and the undertakings given, Mr Wilson and the other directors of PNF Systems and PNF Management are unlikely to take steps which would jeopardise the assets of the companies, especially since the main proceedings have been set down for hearing in the near future.
 In addition, the amount of the overpayment was relatively small and not likely to put the assets in jeopardy, apart from giving Emmacourt cause for concern. 22 I note that some evidence was produced by Emmacourt from Mr Young, who has considerable experience in the franchise industry, to the effect that in his view the extent of any injury to the reputation or day-to-day management of PNF Systems and PNF Management would not be such as to warrant a refusal of the application to appoint a provisional liquidator.
