 By publishing the article in The Sunday Times newspaper, Nationwide News is said to have been "involved", within the meaning of s 74 of the Fair Trading Act (WA), in Mr Barry's contravention of s 10 of that Act.
 Mr Barry accepts that his commission envisaged his consent to the likely publication, by The Sunday Telegraph and The Sunday Times newspapers in Australia or other media institutions within the News Group in Australia, of the substantial terms of the text which he submitted. 16 The allegations that the article contained false statements and that Mr Barry engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct are denied.
 And further: New s 65A will operate to exempt the media and (other persons who engage in businesses of providing information) from the operation of those provisions of Division 1 of Part V of the Trade Practices Act which could inhibit activities relating to the provision of news and other information.
