 In Beecham Group Limited v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 the High Court laid down this approach to the grant of an interlocutory injunction --- there are two inquiries: the first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case in the sense outlined, and the second is as to the balance of convenience.
 I do not agree that that issue can be simply disposed of by reference to the decision of the House of Lords in EI Du Pont De Nemours Co (Witsiepe's) Application [1982] FSR 303, at least not without much closer examination of the issue than is appropriate on an interlocutory application.
 It is not necessary to consider other points of invalidity that will arise on the hearing. 9 However, in my opinion, the combination of the longstanding existence and exploitation of the patent in suit together with the failure of GenRx to bring revocation proceedings in a timely fashion are factors pointing to the appropriateness of the grant of an injunction.
