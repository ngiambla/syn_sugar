 At the time the offer of compromise was made, the trial was scheduled to commence, and did in fact commence, on 12 September 2005, about four weeks later. 17 By a letter dated 24 August 2005, Seven rejected the joint offer of compromise as being ' completely inadequate '.
 As Seven's letter noted, Optus' offer of compromise was conditional in any event upon Seven accepting the joint offer of compromise. 19 Each of the Costs Respondents also seeks an order pursuant to FCR , O 62 r 4(2)(c) that, instead of taxed costs, it should be entitled to a gross sum specified by the Court in respect of costs.
 The Costs Respondents contend that, in order to minimise delay and save unnecessary expense, the Court itself should specify the sum to be paid by Seven by way of costs. 20 If the Costs Respondents do not succeed in obtaining an order that a portion of their costs should be paid on an indemnity basis, Seven does not dispute that an order should be made for the payment of costs on the usual party and party basis.
 The gross sums sought by the Costs Respondents are as follows: PBL Parties (i) Indemnity Basis : $17,710,835.78 to $18,037,694.48 (ii) Party and Party Basis : $16,405,018.36 Telstra Parties (i) Indemnity Basis : $17,175,161.22 (ii) Party and Party Basis : $15,908,677.48 Optus Parties (i) Indemnity Basis : $7,177,489.15 to $7,317,388.77 (ii) Party and Party Basis : $6,923,723.50 CONSENT ORDERS 22 The directions made in the Principal Judgment given on 27 July 2007 provided for the hearing on costs and other unresolved issues to take place on 17 September 2007.
 Seven chose instead (in the language of Telstra's written submissions) to embark on: 'a bold and adventurous piece of litigation, conducted on a vast and impressive scale, ... one of the aims of which was to reshape the landscape of pay television in Australia using the [ Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)] through its claims for damages and structural relief'.
 Seven 44 Seven submits that the proper test to apply on the question of indemnity costs is whether its refusal to accept the joint offer of compromise was imprudent or ' plainly ' unreasonable, although Mr Sheahan acknowledged in his submissions that the addition of the word ' plainly ' might not matter much.
 The offer did not invite Seven to distinguish between its speculative, if not hopeless, causes of action and its arguable contentions. 81 On balance, although the question is not easy to resolve, I do not think that the Costs Respondents have established that Seven's rejection of the offer in August 2005 was imprudent or unreasonable.
