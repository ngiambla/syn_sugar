 The justification for the award of a gross sum in lieu of taxed costs is said to be that if the matter proceeds to taxation in the usual way, the process will take a very long time --- perhaps years --- and is likely to expose the parties to additional very substantial costs.
 In particular, Seven had had insufficient time to determine whether it wished to challenge the gross sums claimed by the Costs Respondents (which, as has been seen, each of the Costs Respondents quantified on both an indemnity and party and party basis). 25 Seven was, however, prepared to contest at the hearing the Costs Respondents' contention that Seven should be ordered to pay costs incurred after 16 August 2005 on an indemnity basis.
 Mr Meagher submitted that it is enough in the circumstances of the present case for the Costs Respondents to show that Seven faced (in the words of Wilcox J in Coshott v Learoyd , at [50]) ' enormous problems ' in this litigation and that Seven must have appreciated the difficulties it confronted when it rejected the joint offer of compromise in August 2005.
