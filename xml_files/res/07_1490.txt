 Although the evidence shows that Brother America imports Brother DR-200 units only from Brother Japan or Brother International and on-sells them with little or no inspection, the evidence does not go so far as to demonstrate that the specific Sample Units and Sample Packaging were sold by Brother America to Discover Group.
 Brother submits that, by selling the products in packaging and using invoices which identify the products as genuine Brother DR-200 units, Dynamic Supplies falsely represented: (i) that the 'BROTHER' trade mark was used with Brother's licence or authority; (ii) that the products in the boxes were of the composition, style and model of genuine Brother DR-200 units; and (iii) that the products attracted the same warranty as genuine Brother DR-200 units. 84 Brother submits that each misrepresentation contravenes ss 52 and 53 (a), (c), (ea) and (g) of the TPA because the use of the 'BROTHER' name by Dynamic Supplies is likely to mislead or deceive members of the public into thinking that the Sample Units sold by Dynamic Supplies were in some way promoted, warranted or distributed by Brother, or at least with Brother's consent or approval, when in fact they were not.
 The packaging and invoices passed off the Sample Units as genuine Brother DR-200 units when, to the contrary, they were OEM products not branded with the Brother trade mark. 91 Accordingly, I find that Dynamic Supplies engaged in the tort of passing off.
