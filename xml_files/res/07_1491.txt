 The Notice of Appeal filed on 8 May 2007 was within time although entirely devoid of any proper formulation of the grounds of review or any material facts in support of those grounds. 18 The question of an amendment first arose at a Directions Hearing conducted on 12 July 2007, it became clear that Dr Mitchelson proposed to file an Amended Notice of Appeal and accordingly the Court ordered that an Amended Notice of Appeal be filed by Monday 30 July 2007.
 The draft report must set out the reasons for the preliminary findings (s 106KD(1A)) and the committee must give the person under review a copy of the draft together with a notice inviting that person to make written submissions to the committee suggesting changes to the draft within one month of receiving the draft (s 106KD(3)). 42 After the period of one month, the committee must, after taking into account any submissions made, prepare a final report setting out the findings of the committee members if they are unanimous in those findings; the majority findings if there be a majority; and if not, the respective findings of the committee members (s 106L).
 The final report must not include a finding of inappropriate practice unless the finding and the reasons for the finding were included in the draft report; the committee must give copies of the final report to the person under review, the director, and the Determining Authority not earlier than one month after the day of which a copy of the report is given to the person under review.
 It makes findings to be relied upon by the Authority in making draft and final determinations containing one or more of the directions contemplated by s 106U which include repayment to the Commonwealth of the whole or part of a medical benefit paid for a service or class of services where inappropriate practice has been found and suspension for a period and/or disqualification for a period from the provision of services to which medical benefits relate.
