 In their cross-claim the respondents pleaded the agreement of 18 June 1999 between Mineral Resources Star Mountains Limited (MRSM) and Morocco Holdings Pty Ltd (Morocco Holdings) under which Mr Fenwick was to provide consultancy services to MRSM in relation to the catering contract tender.
 They say that the cross-claim would not have been necessary at all if not for the fact that Fubilan had instituted the principal proceedings which were orchestrated to a significant degree by the cross-respondents.
 I do not think that it would be an appropriate exercise of my discretion to order that Mr Fenwick and Morocco Holdings pay the respondents' costs of the cross-claim as some kind of punitive exercise.
 Given the involvement of Mr Fenwick and Morocco Holdings in the development of the tender proposal and his involvement in, and knowledge of, material circumstances relevant to the Varied Tender Proposal, it is not surprising that the cross-claim was made against him and Morocco Holdings.
