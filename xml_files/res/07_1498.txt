 It appears to me that this concession warrants the inclusion of a reference to clause 8 in clause 12 without determining whether it is necessary as a matter of law and notwithstanding, as just mentioned, most of the rights and interests identified in clause 11 probably have no legal or practical relevance to the exercise of the native title rights and interests in the exclusive areas. 9 The remaining issues concern schedule D.
 Native title exists in those parts of the determination area identified in Schedule C being made up of: (a) the areas of land and waters to which s 47B of the Act applies, and more particularly described in item 1(a) of Schedule C ('the exclusive areas'); (b) the remaining areas of land and waters, being the areas more particularly described in item 1(b) of Schedule C ('the non-exclusive areas') 3.
 The land and waters of the determination area comprise the whole or part of nine estates, which are held respectively by the members of the following nine estate groups: (a) the Marlinja (Collins) group; (b) the [Y]Ijiparta (Kingston) group; (c) the Elliott (Gurungu/Kulumintini) group; (d) the Warranangku (Beetaloo) group; (e) the Kulaja (North Waterhole) group; (f) the Powell Creek (Walanpiri) group; (g) the Ngapurr (Nellis Waterhole) group; (h) the North Western group; (i) the Murranji (Narlwan/Nyirrinji) group.
 Each of the estate groups referred to in clause 4 hereof includes persons who are members of the group by reason of: (a) patrilineal descent; (b) his or her mother, father's mother or mother's mother being or having been a member of the group by reason of patrilineal descent; (c) having been adopted or incorporated into the descent relationships referred to in (a) or (b) hereof. (These persons are collectively referred to as 'the estate group members'. ) 6.
 In accordance with traditional laws and customs, other Aboriginal people have rights and interests in respect of the determination area, subject to the rights and interests of the estate group members, such people being: (a) members of the following Mudburra or Jingili estate groups from neighbouring estates: (i) the Tururrutpa (Hidden Valley) group; (ii) the Powell Creek (Japurla-japurla/Yapa-yapa/Mali-mali group); (iii) the Top Springs (Yingawunarri) group; (iv) the Badpa (Daly Waters) group; (v) the Bamarrjganja (Walanja) group; (vi) the Kinbininggu (Peter's Hole), Abie Thomas and Major Taylor group; (b) spouses of the estate group members. 7.
 Each of the estate groups referred to in clause 6(a) hereof includes persons who are members of the group by reason of: (a) patrilineal descent; (b) his or her mother, father's mother or mother's mother being or having been a member of the group by reason of patrilineal descent; (c) having been adopted or incorporated into the descent relationships referred to in (a) or (b) hereof.
 In relation to the exclusive areas, the native title rights and interests that are possessed under their traditional laws and customs are, subject to the traditional laws and customs that govern the exercise of the native title rights and interests by the native title holders, possession, occupation, use and enjoyment to the exclusion of all others. 9.
 In relation to the non-exclusive areas, the native title rights and interests in the estate group members that are possessed under their traditional laws and customs are, subject to the traditional laws and customs that govern the exercise of the native title rights and interests by the native title holders, non-exclusive rights to use and enjoy those areas being: (a) the right to travel over, to move about and to have access to those areas; (b) the right to hunt and to fish on the land and waters of those areas; (c) the right to gather and to use the natural resources of those areas such as food, medicinal plants, wild tobacco, timber, stone and resin; (d) the right to take and to use the natural water on those areas, and for the sake of clarity and the avoidance of doubt this right does not include the right to take or use water captured by the holders of Perpetual Pastoral Lease 1074 or Perpetual Pastoral Lease 947; (e) the right to live, to camp and for that purpose to erect shelters and other structures on those areas; (f) the right to light fires on those areas for domestic purposes, but not for the clearance of vegetation; (g) the right to conduct and to participate in the following activities on those areas: (i) cultural activities; (ii) cultural practices relating to birth and death, including burial rites; (iii) ceremonies; (iv) meetings; (v) teaching the physical and spiritual attributes of sites and places on those areas that are of significance under their traditional laws and customs; (h) the right to maintain and to protect sites and places on those areas that are of significance under their traditional laws and customs; (i) the right to share or exchange subsistence and other traditional resources obtained on or from those areas; (j) the right to be accompanied on to those areas by persons who, though not native title holders, are: (i) people required by traditional law and custom for the performance of ceremonies or cultural activities on the areas; (ii) people who have rights in relation to the areas according to the traditional laws and customs acknowledged by the estate group members; (iii) people required by the estate group members to assist in, observe, or record traditional activities on the areas; (k) the right to conduct activities necessary to give effect to the rights referred to in (a) to (j) hereof.
 To the extent, if at all, that the exercise of the native title rights and interests referred to in clauses 8, 9 and 10 conflicts with the exercise of the rights and interests of the persons referred to in clause 11, the rights and interests of the persons referred to in clause 11 prevail over, but do not extinguish, the native title rights referred to in clauses 8, 9 and 10.
 There are no native title rights and interests in: (a) minerals (as defined in s 2 of the Minerals (Acquisition) Act (NT)); (b) petroleum (as defined in s 5 of the Petroleum Act (NT)) (c) prescribed substances (as defined in s 3 of the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Act 1946 (Cth) and/or s 5(1) of the Atomic Energy Act 1953 (Cth)), in the determination area. 14.
