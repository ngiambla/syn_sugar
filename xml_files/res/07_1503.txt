 Mr Foroughi also contends that express misleading representations, said to be in trade or commerce, were made to him by an employee of Star City when he was being escorted from the casino after the voluntary exclusion order was made. 8 Both of these representations are denied by Star City.
 Mr Ador Palad, an inspector employed by the Casino Control Authority, spoke with Mr Foroughi and arranged for a security officer to escort him from the casino. 23 On 20 April 2006, Mr Bujaroski again detected Mr Foroughi in the casino in breach of the voluntary exclusion order.
 Nevertheless, I will do so briefly. 88 Star City's evidence of the systems it had in place to detect excluded patrons and its evidence of the size of the casino and volume of patronage, shows that there was no guarantee that excluded patrons would be detected.
 Mr Clark accepted that this was so. 89 It follows that if Star City had represented to Mr Foroughi that it would be able to detect him in the event he entered the casino, it would not have had reasonable grounds for the representation.
