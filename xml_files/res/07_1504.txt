 On 8 September 2003 Ms Butler lodged a claim for compensation under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the Act') in respect of 'nerve entrapment at elbow and nerve entrapment at wrist' of her left arm. 2 Telstra determined, and affirmed on reconsideration of that determination, that it was not liable to pay compensation to Ms Butler.
 Rather, the Tribunal assumed its accuracy but decided, partly by reference to the evidence of Dr Harvey, that the symptoms that she experienced in her left elbow had no connection with the way that she held the telephone at work.
 The Tribunal was not under an obligation to disregard the symptoms experienced by Ms Butler in her right arm because no person expressed an expert opinion on the relevance of the symptoms in Ms Butler's right arm other than in respect of her carpal tunnel syndrome.
 While acknowledging that the Tribunal was not bound by the rules of evidence, Ms Butler argued that 'there must be occasions and are occasions that a tribunal could reject evidence that is clearly inadmissible and based on extreme hearsay' . 38 Ms Carrall was Ms Butler's manager although she did not work at the same location as Ms Butler.
