 At issue is whether the Seven Licensees have contravened the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') in the course of broadcasting the Episodes and whether the Seven Network is liable for any such contravention.
 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the Commission') alleges that in the course of broadcasting the Episodes, the Seven Licensees contravened s 52 of the Act by making, or adopting as their own, misleading and deceptive representations concerning Ms Boholt, Ms Forster and the Mentoring Program.
 The episode conveys, the Commission says, an assessment by the Seven Licensees that Ms Boholt and Ms Forster are wealthy and that participants in the Mentoring Program will likewise become wealthy ( Australian Ocean Line at 587 per Toohey J).
