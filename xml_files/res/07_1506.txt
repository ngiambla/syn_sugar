 The applicant accused him of being a "scab" and, presumably sarcastically, accused him of being "a real big hero". 4 On 19 June 2007, Mr Reidy, whose responsibilities include managing the warehouse, sought to give the applicant a letter though the applicant refused to accept it.
 In that letter, Mr Reidy referred to the letter of 19 June 2007 and stated that the response received from the NUW was not adequate, that the respondent believed that the conduct alleged did occur and that termination of the applicant's employment may be appropriate.
 The applicant submits that an inference might be drawn that the applicant was not alone amongst the striking employees in making offensive and abusive remarks to other employees who remained at work as they sought to cross the picket line.
 If this inference was drawn, then it raises the question of why only the applicant, and not the other employees, was alleged to have engaged in serious misconduct and, in the result, dismissed.
