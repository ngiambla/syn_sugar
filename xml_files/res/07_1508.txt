 It said that, to his credit, Mr Vu had accepted the responsibility for the offences and indicated to the Service that he was prepared to accept any sentence imposed by the court.
 It is clear that Mr Vu is a man who has learned his lesson and has now realised how wrong his behaviour was and how, by going out of character, he has placed himself and his family in jeopardy.
 Although, as the police has pointed out, in white collar or fraud-related crimes the need for general deterrence is strong and that need reduces the weight to be given to this factor.
 I am also mindful that Mr Vu was a man whose business and educational experience were not great and did not equip him properly to protect himself when he decided to enter into the business transaction in which he acquired HD Home Video.
