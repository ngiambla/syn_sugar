 The applicant, TS B Retail Systems Pty Ltd (TSB Retail), alleges that the corporate respondent, 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (3Fold), copied 234 manufacturing drawings and 5 tables of data in which TSB Retail holds copyright.
 Conversely, information such as the cost (to TSB of acquiring a part from another supplier) and the sale price of each part could easily be publicly available (if TSB and its suppliers sold their parts to other customers).
 This category includes drawings prepared by contractors and later amended by employees, drawings prepared by employees and later amended by contractors and drawings prepared by persons unknown and later amended by contractors or employees.
 The only evidence of this custom was the agreements and drafts already referred to together with an agreement between Kmart and TSB Retail for the supply by TSB Retail of goods and services to Kmart.
