 The Collective submits that the removal of the reply to another part of the site suggests it had been posted beneath the Second Message in error and, when the error was realised two hours later, it was moved to a part of the Forum to which it was more relevant.
 It also relies upon the defence provided by s 18D(c)(ii). 26 There is little difficulty in applying s 18C to the author of a message posted on an Internet website, as has been seen in relation to the second respondent.
 The position of others involved in the chain between author and ultimate reader is not so clear. 27 The applicant submits that the decision in Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd [2001] QB 201, [1999] 4 All ER 342; [2000] 3 WLR 1020 should be applied.
