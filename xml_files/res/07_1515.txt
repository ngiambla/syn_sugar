 Your Grandfathered Allowance will replace any Grandfathered Allowance that you may have previously received (as part of your Actual Salary) for your old job. " 30 The term "Grandfathered Allowance" was defined in cl 11.3 as: " ... an annualised allowance which is paid fortnightly and calculated as the difference between an employee's Actual Salary and the Company Rate for their job.
 Any Grandfathered Allowance will be paid in accordance with either clause 12.2.3 or clause 12.5(b) of [the IS EA 2002]. " The Actual Salary for an employee entitled to a Grandfathered Allowance ("Grandfathered Employees") was the sum of the Company Rate for his or her job plus the Grandfathered Allowance: cl 11.3. 31 This was the first time a 'Grandfathered Allowance' had been introduced.
 In short, whether to accept the employee for redeployment to a particular position was and remains a decision for Telstra. 55 The textual and historical considerations referred to earlier, coupled with the rejection of Telstra's arguments founded in allegedly extreme or odd results "from an industrial view point", are determinative.
 Telstra breached the 2005 Enterprise Agreement by failing to provide Mr McDonald salary maintenance as required by cl 17.4 (as well as redundancy benefits under cl 9.1 of the TRA at the higher rate of pay) after he was redeployed to, and later accepted a redundancy package from, a lower-paying position.
