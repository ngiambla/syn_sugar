 Boyce objected to the content of that article, and counsel for Boyce described it as possessing "more than just a touch of hyperbole". 6 In this context, Boyce says that it fears Autodata will not treat the Report --- which is said to contain sensitive information about Boyce's internal business actions, procedures and decisions --- as confidential.
 The issue therefore, is whether the information, considered objectively, can be said to have the requisite degree of confidentiality. 12 Having considered the submissions of counsel and examined the Report in detail, I find that some limited material in the Report is confidential, and is appropriately the subject of an order under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
