 In advance of the hearing before the VMC, Ms Winn sought a stay of the hearing on the basis that the complaint contravened s 106(1) of the Legal Practice Act 1996 (Vic) ("the Legal Practice Act"), which provision had been repealed in advance of the VMC proceeding by Part 8.1 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (Vic).
 McInnis FM agreed to hear the application for a stay of the Costs Decision before delivering his reasons for decision on 11 July 2007. 13 On the morning of 11 July 2007, Ms Winn sent by facsimile a further application to the FMC requesting that McInnis FM disqualify himself from determining the substantive application.
 An application for leave to appeal may be heard and determined by a single judge: ss 24(1A) , 25 (1B) and 25 (2) of the Federal Court Act . 17 The Costs Decision must be considered separately from the Stay and Bias Decisions.
 Ms Winn submitted from the bar table that the facsimile (of 21 pages) recorded as having been sent at 16.04 pm comprised the application for leave to appeal and an unsworn affidavit which exhibited a draft of the notice of appeal.
