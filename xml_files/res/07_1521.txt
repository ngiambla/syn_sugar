 I have had regard to Mr Fisher's contention that [the prosecutor's] crimes arose from his drug addiction and that he is now undergoing methadone treatment for his drug addiction.
 Hence, as events turned out, the prosecutor was not treated unfairly. 18 The second ground of attack is that the Minister failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely that the prosecutor's removal from Australia would deny to him methadone treatment for his drug addiction.
