 The character of the Machine Agreements is not relevantly altered by the provisions which made it a condition precedent that the Sub-Distributors enter into the Sub-Distribution Agreements or the acknowledgments that the conditions of use of the machines were to be governed and the intellectual property rights attaching to them protected by the Sub-Distribution Agreements.
 These activities, on the part of Kyloe and Impact, even if considered cumulatively, in my opinion, fall well short of a system or marketing plan. 56 In coming to this conclusion I do not have regard to the evidence that the contractual obligations, imposed on Sub-Distributors by the Sub-Distribution Agreements, relating to the submission of written reports to Kyloe and the ordering of minimum quantities of products were not, in fact, enforced.
 Were it necessary to do so I would also hold that, in so far as the Morpeths and McCann, in their dealing with the Sub-Distributors, touched on matters which might relate to a system or marketing plan, they did not suggest that a particular system or plan should be adopted.
 The suppliers' profit arises from the difference between the price at which they manufacture or which they pay for the goods and the price at which they are able to sell the goods to the distributor. " The contractual arrangements between Kyloe and the Sub-Distributors, as incorporated in the Sub-Distribution Agreement, bear the hallmarks of a distributorship.
