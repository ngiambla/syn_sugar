 Therefore I have terminated this complaint pursuant to section 46PH(1)(c) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 . ' 8 Apart from the complaint against individuals Ms Lawrance also complained about the possibility of contribution to the alleged acts of discrimination by agencies of the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales.
 It appears to be alleged that this conduct is discriminatory 'by imputing to me a psychiatric impairment in the provision of services' and that, accordingly, '[t]he [individual] respondents have participated in the provision to me of diagnostic and assessment services'.
 Finally, she complains in the affidavit about evidence given in the proceedings before the FMCA by a Ms Carmody and the fact that she was not allowed to call a Ms Smith for cross-examination. 33 Ms Lawrance filed a further affidavit on 4 September 2007.
