 Section 170-50 required that the agreement must be made on or before the date of lodgment of the transferring company's income tax return for the deduction year "... or within such further time as the Commissioner allows".
 He wanted to make sure that the granting of further extensions to the Commissioner to amend Development Finance's assessment for 1999 would not unduly disadvantage the BHP Group for the 2000 year of income which was also being audited.
 On 29 March 2005 he again wrote to Mr Mulqueen and asked for a further extension of the period within which the Commissioner might amend the assessment for Development Finance for the 1999 year of income.
 On 13 May 2005 Mr Mulqueen received a facsimile from Mr Killaly attaching a notice of amended assessment for Development Finance and an income tax adjustment sheet increasing the taxable income of Development Finance by $89,848,367.
