 Orders under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act and s 72 of the Fair Trading Act 8 A major issue in contention is the proposed orders for distribution of the partnership assets and compensation for the applicant.
 The letter, which was without prejudice except as to costs, offered to settle the matter "conditional upon mutual releases and the surrender of our client's interest in the business ... and the withdrawal of the caveat over the Narrabeen property" on payment by the respondents to the applicant of (a) the sum of $180,000 (without interest); and (b) the cost of the proceedings on a party/party basis to the date of the offer.
 It is not necessary for me to recount that history other than to say it appears that the second respondent had accepted an offer to settle for $350,000 and had failed to make the payment by the agreed date.
