 Shortly thereafter Arkaroola commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland against Niugini Mining and the State of Queensland claiming on various grounds that the termination was unlawful. 3 On 18 October 2001 the Supreme Court struck out the proceeding because of Arkaroola's failure to file expert evidence as directed.
 They advised that there did not appear to be a strong chance of success in an action against Niugini Mining and that there did not appear to be any chance of the liquidators obtaining funding to pursue such litigation.
 The liquidators intended to apply to finalise the liquidation by applying to ASIC to deregister the company. 78 On 9 December Mr Salfinger wrote to the liquidators advising that he had located litigation funding and funding to support the filing fees.
