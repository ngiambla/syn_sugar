 That rule provides: '3(1) If an applicant is in default, the court may order that: (a) the proceeding be stayed or dismissed as to the whole or any part of the relief claimed by the applicant. ' Under Order 35A rule 2 an applicant is in default if, amongst other things, the applicant fails to attend a directions hearing. 7 I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the proceedings be dismissed under Order 35A rule 3(1)(a).
 As Mr Markus has pointed out to me, dismissal of the proceedings does not impinge upon the applicant's right to make an application under Order 35 rule 7, even from New Zealand, in the circumstances dealt with by that rule. 8 Mr Markus has also asked for costs on behalf of the Minister.
 I am not satisfied that, in the exercise of my discretion, I should order costs against the applicant when, in every practical sense, his inability to attend personally is the direct result of the fact that he was removed from Australia after the proceedings had been commenced and after a date had been fixed at which they would come before the Court in the ordinary way. 9 In the circumstances, notwithstanding Mr Markus's robust arguments to the contrary, I decline to order costs. 10 I make the following orders: 1. the proceedings are dismissed under Order 35A rule 3(1)(a); 2. there be no order as to costs.
