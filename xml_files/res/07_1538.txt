 It said this was because, if Mr Kielt were correct, and if the Tribunal accepted his evidence, insoles simply were not designed to correct orthopaedic conditions. 25 Secondly, Customs contended that the Tribunal's decision did not discuss in terms its argument to that effect. 26 Customs pointed to a number of pieces of evidence before the Tribunal in which persons had used indifferently the terms 'insoles', 'inserts', 'devices' and 'orthoses'.
 The reason the Tribunal gave for rejecting that question was simple and correct: Mr Kielt, not being an orthopaedic surgeon, could not speak for one. 34 In his evidence Mr Kielt also sought to explain, perhaps argumentatively, that an orthotic had distinguishing features from an insole centred around its ability to control the position of the person who had the device in his or her shoe.
 He sought to make the point that insoles, such as in sports shoes, or replacements of those which could be purchased commercially, had a different function. 35 The Tribunal said, correctly, that no evidence was called to dispute ICB's evidence about what an insole was.
 The Tribunal used this to illustrate the difference between an insole or special insoles and the orthotic inserts here. 37 The patent for the goods to which the Tribunal referred described the goods as orthotic inserts.
