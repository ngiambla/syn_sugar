 In the letter Jonathan Remta said: This company is prepared to arrange the underwriting, which would be with a leading stockbroker but would include some of the shareholders of Pharmaust Limited and their associates as sub-underwriters.
 In addition, this underwriting would be acceptable to and supported by many of the shareholders, even if they did not necessarily take up their rights or participate in the underwriting of the rights issue.
 The underwriting agreement would give Cardrona discretion over the placement of the shortfall but the board had negotiated that all requests for shortfall received from shareholders would be forwarded to Cardrona for consideration in conjunction with requirements from sub-underwriters.
