 In the letter Jonathan Remta said: This company is prepared to arrange the underwriting, which would be with a leading stockbroker but would include some of the shareholders of Pharmaust Limited and their associates as sub-underwriters.
 In addition, this underwriting would be acceptable to and supported by many of the shareholders, even if they did not necessarily take up their rights or participate in the underwriting of the rights issue.
 The underwriting agreement would give Cardrona discretion over the placement of the shortfall but the board had negotiated that all requests for shortfall received from shareholders would be forwarded to Cardrona for consideration in conjunction with requirements from sub-underwriters.
 The proposed timetable involved lodgment of the prospectus with ASIC on 11 September 2007, notice to shareholders on 13 September 2007, opening date and despatch of prospectus to shareholders on 22 September 2007, closing date of offers on 9 October 2007 and shares quoted on a deferred settlement basis on 10 October 2007.
