 No explanation was provided by APM as to why it did not apply under s 459G of the Corporations Act to set aside the statutory demand. 9 In these circumstances, I am proceeding on the basis that the application by the creditors is an application based upon a failure by APM to comply with a valid statutory demand.
 The factors upon which his conclusion of "marginal" solvency are subject, putting aside the accuracy of the Balance Sheet, depend upon the immediate sale of the properties and net proceeds being not only placed with the Court, but also available to the creditors and the other supporting creditors who APM accepts have valid claims.
 The attack made was upon the appropriateness or otherwise of his approach and the material he relied upon. 28 In any event, whilst I accept that the rule in Browne v Dunn may apply to expert testimony, there is no rule of law requiring that evidence not challenged in cross-examination be accepted.
