 However, that was not the end of the matter because of s 600B and, in particular, s 447A of the Act. 8 Although the Administrators did not press the present submission in oral submissions, I should say a little more about it. 9 In the earlier Reasons at [13]---[29] and [167]---[180] I dealt with the Administrators' different submission that the DCT lacked standing to make the present application.
 It may have been an oversight that the DCT did not apply for costs against the Administrators in the Originating Process that commenced the proceeding on 9 March 2006, or it may be that the formulation of her Points of Claim had caused the DCT to appreciate that her case was that Mr Hamilton had fallen short in the discharge of his responsibilities. 15 In both the original and amended Originating Processes, the DCT indicated that she was applying under, inter alia, s 600B of the Act.
 But to some extent, that is because the Administrators have scrutinised her conduct with the benefit of hindsight --- an approach to which the DCT has subjected Mr Hamilton, and to which the Administrators say he should not have been subjected. 23 Be this as it may, I do not regard the ATO officer's silence followed by the advancing of the present case by the DCT as constituting conduct so unreasonable that an order for indemnity costs is called for.
