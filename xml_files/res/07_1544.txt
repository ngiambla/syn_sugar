 The Application 16 As I have recorded, Mr Smark invited me to deal with the disqualification application at the interlocutory hearing in the taxation proceedings on 18 September 2007 which, at the parties' request, had been listed at short notice.
 I indicated to Mr Smark that I was content to follow the course he suggested. 17 Mr Smark did not file any written submissions, but made brief oral submissions on behalf of Channel 7 in support of the disqualification application.
 I doubt that a fair-minded observer would read the C7 Judgment as exhibiting judicial ' annoyance ' at Seven, as distinct from understanding the judgment to record the considered views of a trial Judge, even if strongly expressed at times, on matters of importance arising from the manner in which the proceedings were conducted.
