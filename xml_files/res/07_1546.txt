 1 This is a proceeding by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) against four respondents, the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (the CFMEU), Bovis Lend Lease Limited, David Noonan and Laslo Lancsar, alleging contraventions of s 45E and s 45EA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the Act).
 The other respondents made no such concession and, in the events which have happened, a decision was made that the case against Bovis Lend Lease would be dealt with on its admissions independently of the conduct of the contested proceeding against the other respondents.
 The contested hearing has been completed before another judge of the Court, although judgment has been reserved. 3 So far as this proceeding is concerned, the parties have arrived at a comprehensive statement of agreed facts, which was made jointly by the ACCC and Bovis Lend Lease for the sole purpose of tendering under s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) .
