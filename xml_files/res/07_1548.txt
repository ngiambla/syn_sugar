 The fall of the wall was caused by the operation of a mechanical pallet stacker by an employee of a company, Designcraft Furniture Pty Ltd (Designcraft), which had been engaged by the respondent to undertake work in connection with setting up that temporary exhibition.
 The statement of facts and the incorporated documents set out in considerable detail the circumstances surrounding the incident itself, the arrangements made with the contractor, the investigation of what occurred, and what has occurred thereafter to ensure that this does not happen again.
 The parties are agreed that in addition to a declaration as to breach, there should be a pecuniary penalty ordered in the sum of $20,000. 4 In support of the appropriateness of that figure, I am invited to approach what is put forward along the lines discussed by the Full Court in Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd (2004) ATPR 41-993, [2004] FCAFC 72.
 I have also been referred to other authorities dealing more closely with questions of occupational health and safety including the recent case of Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia (2007) 162 IR 407, [2007] FCA 662 , where Madgwick J looked at a number of the factors which have been regarded as relevant by courts dealing with similar legislation in other jurisdictions. 5 The maximum penalty which might be involved is $242,000.
