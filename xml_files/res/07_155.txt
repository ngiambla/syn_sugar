 By amended application the appellant relied upon two grounds of appeal: first, that the Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty by breaching s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'); and second, that the Tribunal did not believe the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner due to bias. 5 The Federal Magistrate rejected the first ground, and held that the Tribunal did not breach s 424A of the Act as it did not rely on any information that was necessary to provide to the appellant for comment: at [22]-[23].
 I agree with the Federal Magistrate's finding, that there is no basis to conclude that the Tribunal's decision was affected by actual or apprehended bias: SCAA v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 ; VFAB v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 ; (2003) 131 FCR 102. 9 The second ground of appeal contends that the Tribunal failed to perform the statutory duty imposed by s 424A of the Act.
 His Honour found the Tribunal was not required to give written particulars of the information referred to under the heading 'Country Information' because that material fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(a) of the Act: Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572.
 I need not examine this issue because in my view, at the hearing, the Tribunal did identify the issues upon which its decision was based and gave the appellant the opportunity to address the issues and make submissions.
