 I agree with the Federal Magistrate's finding, that there is no basis to conclude that the Tribunal's decision was affected by actual or apprehended bias: SCAA v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 ; VFAB v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 ; (2003) 131 FCR 102. 9 The second ground of appeal contends that the Tribunal failed to perform the statutory duty imposed by s 424A of the Act.
 His Honour found the Tribunal was not required to give written particulars of the information referred to under the heading 'Country Information' because that material fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(a) of the Act: Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs v NAMW [2004] FCAFC 264 ; (2004) 140 FCR 572.
 I need not examine this issue because in my view, at the hearing, the Tribunal did identify the issues upon which its decision was based and gave the appellant the opportunity to address the issues and make submissions.
