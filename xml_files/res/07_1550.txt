 For comparison purposes, I will assume the maximum penalty to be $22,000 --- a rough average of the amounts before and after the increase --- bearing in mind the number of offences that were involved.
 I would not agree to substituting a judge's checklist for the unrestrained statutory discretion. 12 I have discussed the nature and extent of the breaches and will come back to that in a moment.
 However that may be, the non-adherence to the Award and the nature and scale of the underpayment here indicates that if the law is breached the business community should not get the idea that they can take the risk of underpaying and then buy their way out of it with a modest penalty.
 I have also received some assistance from a spreadsheet prepared by the solicitor for the respondent, comparing different cases, although that sort of comparison is very difficult because of differing circumstances.
