 Second, there is no difficulty in each of the first and second defendants being responsible for the conduct of the first defendant ( Houghton v Arms [2006] HCA 59 ; (2006) 225 CLR 553).
 Regulation 2B of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Regulations 2001 (Cth) defines "credit facility" in a manner that is apt to pick up what took place between the second defendant, Mr Biega and Pepper Homeloans. 6 The conduct was, in all the circumstances, "unconscionable".
 That term, in this section, is not limited as it is in s 12CA by a connection with the unwritten law (cf s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51; GPG (Australia Trading) Pty Ltd v GIO Australia Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1761 ; (2001) 117 FCR 23 at [113] ---[126]).
