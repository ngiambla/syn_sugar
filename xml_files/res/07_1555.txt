 On 9 June 2007, Finkelstein J made a direction to a Registrar under O 46 r 7A of the Federal Court Rules that the notice of motion dated 30 May 2007 be refused for filing.
 For those reasons, access is refused. 21 In the circumstances, I would not grant Ms Bahonko leave to appeal Goldberg J's refusal to grant a stay of the Substantive Orders.
 I would dismiss paras 1, 2 and 3 of the Notice of Motion and order Ms Bahonko to pay the respondents' costs of and incidental to those paragraphs in the Notice of Motion. 22 Finally, there was no doubt that Goldberg J correctly refused to grant an injunction in the alternative to a grant of a stay.
