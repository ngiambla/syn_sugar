 BACKGROUND Substantive Proceedings 3 The history of the substantive proceedings which give rise to this Notice of Motion are set out in the reasons for decision I delivered earlier today in VID 822 of 2007: see Bahonko v Sterjov Ors [2007] FCA 1555 at [3] to [7].
 ANALYSIS Application for leave to access transcripts: para 1 of the Notice of Motion 4 Ms Bahonko seeks an order that the Court make available to her a transcript in an electronic form or in a printed form of the substantive proceedings before Jessup J. 5 Having regard to the reasons for decision of Jessup J and the grounds of appeal, it appears to me to be inevitable that the Appeal Books before the Full Court of the Federal Court will need to include a copy of the transcript of the evidence given by Ms Bahonko and the respondents' witnesses.
 Jessup J did not grant leave to file these applications: see [8] at paras (2) and (4) and [9] of Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 867. 15 On 30 May 2007, Ms Bahonko sought leave to appeal Jessup J's decision not to grant leave to file the statement of charge for contempt of Court.
 The appeal process is the procedure to be adopted by Ms Bahonko if she seeks to challenge the findings made by Jessup J. 18 There is no basis for Ms Bahonko's purported contempt claims to be heard and determined.
