 Appellant's claims of Contempt of the Court by Mr McKenney, Mr Vitiello, the Defendants and their witness Ms Esther Keji Matthew to be determined prior to the appeal hearing the Contempt of the Court proceeding is deemed to commenced. " 2 For the reasons below, subject to one qualification, I would dismiss the Notice of Motion.
 BACKGROUND Substantive Proceedings 3 The history of the substantive proceedings which give rise to this Notice of Motion are set out in the reasons for decision I delivered earlier today in VID 822 of 2007: see Bahonko v Sterjov Ors [2007] FCA 1555 at [3] to [7].
 ANALYSIS Application for leave to access transcripts: para 1 of the Notice of Motion 4 Ms Bahonko seeks an order that the Court make available to her a transcript in an electronic form or in a printed form of the substantive proceedings before Jessup J. 5 Having regard to the reasons for decision of Jessup J and the grounds of appeal, it appears to me to be inevitable that the Appeal Books before the Full Court of the Federal Court will need to include a copy of the transcript of the evidence given by Ms Bahonko and the respondents' witnesses.
 Application for leave to stay the Costs Orders pending the determination of the Appeal: para 2 of the Notice of Motion 6 Ms Bahonko applies for a stay of the Costs Orders. 7 Order 52 r 17(1) of the Federal Court Rules provides that: An appeal to the Court shall not --- (a) operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment appealed from; or (b) invalidate any intermediate act or proceeding; except so far as the Court or a Judge or the court below may direct . 8 Goldberg J considered the question of a stay of the Substantive Orders in Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1377.
 His Honour summarised the principles in the following terms at [6]: "The general principle which is applied in the Court is that an appeal does not operate as a stay unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders.
 Whether or not such a stay should be granted depends upon whether the Court or a Judge thinks in all the circumstances that the matter is an appropriate case for the grant of a stay: See, for example, Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Co (1996) 137 ALR 498. " 9 The primary matter relied upon by Ms Bahonko in support of a stay was that " there were and are not any costs due against me. " That is an issue for the Appeal of the Substantive Orders. 10 The additional matters referred to by Ms Bahonko in her affidavit sworn on 20 September 2007 and in her oral submissions are properly described as scandalous and vexatious.
 Application for removal of legal representatives: para 3 of the Notice of Motion 12 Ms Bahonko seeks an order that the respondents' counsel and solicitors "step down from a legal representation in the appeal matter VID 743/07".
 Jessup J did not grant leave to file these applications: see [8] at paras (2) and (4) and [9] of Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 867. 15 On 30 May 2007, Ms Bahonko sought leave to appeal Jessup J's decision not to grant leave to file the statement of charge for contempt of Court.
 On 9 June 2007, Finkelstein J made a direction to a Registrar under O 46 r 7A of the Federal Court Rules that the notice of motion dated 30 May 2007 be refused for filing. 16 A direction under O 46 r 7A is not a judgment able to be subjected to an appeal by Ms Bahonko: Bizuneh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 42 ; (2003) 128 FCR 353 at [19] per Lee, Whitlam and Jacobson JJ.
 That application is dismissed. 17 In relation to other purported contempt claims made by Ms Bahonko about the evidence given by witnesses during the course of the trial before Jessup J, there is no basis for those allegations to be made, let alone heard and determined.
 The appeal process is the procedure to be adopted by Ms Bahonko if she seeks to challenge the findings made by Jessup J. 18 There is no basis for Ms Bahonko's purported contempt claims to be heard and determined.
 Conclusion 19 Ms Bahonko is to be provided with a copy of the transcript of evidence before Jessup J in VID 114/2006 in an electronic form at the expense of the Court. 20 The notice of motion dated 20 September 2007 is otherwise dismissed.
