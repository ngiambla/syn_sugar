 Therefore, in determining whether the communications enjoy the privilege claimed, the relevant test to be applied in each case is whether the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49.
 Whether these copy documents enjoy legal professional privilege will depend upon whether the copy was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice: Australian Federal Police Commissioner v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501. 13 The party asserting the privilege --- in this case, the applicant --- bears the onus of proving it. 14 These applicable principles give rise to two issues to be decided in the present case.
 The respondents put two submissions to the effect that the Legal and Advice Branch was not independent of the OWS and therefore was not a legal adviser for the purposes of legal professional privilege. 23 First, they submit that the onus was on the applicant to establish his claim for privilege and that included adducing evidence that the Legal and Advice Branch was independent of the OWS.
