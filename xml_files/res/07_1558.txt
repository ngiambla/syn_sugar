 1 On 23 August 2007, I made orders convening a meeting of the holders of the ordinary shares in Peplin Limited for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing to a scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between that company and its shareholders.
 I also made orders convening a meeting of the holders of options quoted on the Stock Exchange to subscribe for shares in the company for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing to a scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between the company and those option-holders.
 At the option-holders' meeting, 99.98 per cent of all votes cast, representing 96.55 per cent of option-holders in number, were in favour of the motion to approve the scheme. 3 I am satisfied that the formalities associated with the calling of the meetings were complied with, save for one irregularity due to a fault on the part of a mailing house.
