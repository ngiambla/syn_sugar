 1 On 23 August 2007, I made orders convening a meeting of the holders of the ordinary shares in Peplin Limited for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing to a scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between that company and its shareholders.
 I also made orders convening a meeting of the holders of options quoted on the Stock Exchange to subscribe for shares in the company for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing to a scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between the company and those option-holders.
 At the option-holders' meeting, 99.98 per cent of all votes cast, representing 96.55 per cent of option-holders in number, were in favour of the motion to approve the scheme. 3 I am satisfied that the formalities associated with the calling of the meetings were complied with, save for one irregularity due to a fault on the part of a mailing house.
 I am also satisfied that it is appropriate to make an exemption order pursuant to s 411(12) , that is, there is no need for a court order approving the scheme to be annexed to every copy of the constitution of the company. 6 I have been asked to note that if the Court grants approval of the schemes, Peplin Incorporated intends to rely upon the Court's approval for the purposes of the exemption under s 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act 1933 of the United States. 7 I make orders in accordance with the draft order which I have initialled and placed with the papers, including an order that the orders be entered forthwith.
