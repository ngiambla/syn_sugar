 The Amended Statement of Claim alleges that from a date not later than 1 May 2000, Amcor and Visy supplied CFP to Jarra Creek and members of the representative group in the CFP market, and that from about January 2000 Amcor and Visy were in competition with each other.
 The difficulty is to select a suitable period before and after the core period within which to require production of documents, particularly in a case such as the present where the volume of documents is likely to be extremely large.
 Having regard to the evidence as to the burden, nature and extent of discovery required, and balancing this against the needs expressed by Professor Rubinfeld to enable proper consideration of the effect of the alleged price fixing activity, I consider that an appropriate period for production is between 1 January 1998, which is two years prior to the alleged commencement of the conduct, and mid-2006.
 Amcor and Visy submit that in class action cases, issues of quantum and damage are to be determined in relation to each specific class member, and that discovery in relation to those issues should be deferred until the antecedent question of liability is determined.
