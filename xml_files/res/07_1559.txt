 The Amended Statement of Claim alleges that from a date not later than 1 May 2000, Amcor and Visy supplied CFP to Jarra Creek and members of the representative group in the CFP market, and that from about January 2000 Amcor and Visy were in competition with each other.
 Amcor and Visy submit that in class action cases, issues of quantum and damage are to be determined in relation to each specific class member, and that discovery in relation to those issues should be deferred until the antecedent question of liability is determined.
