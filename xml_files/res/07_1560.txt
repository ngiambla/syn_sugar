 The reasoning does not assist in the present case because the Court limited its statement to an observation that an application for preliminary discovery is not an interlocutory proceeding in a defamation action ; which it plainly is not and could not be.
 In London Economics (Aust) Pty Ltd v Frontier Economics Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 932 at [19] (" London Economics "), Finkelstein J expressly disagreed with the reasoning of Lindgren J in Levis and referred to a number of decisions of intermediate appellate courts to which Lindgren J had not been referred and which held that applications under rules of courts equivalent of O 15A are interlocutory in nature.
 It did not preclude further orders limiting or extending the scope of the investigation which the rule permits. ' 16 In Malouf v Malouf [1999] FCA 284 ; (1999) 86 FCR 134 (" Malouf "), the Full Federal Court held that an order on an application for pre-trial discovery under O 15A r 6 is interlocutory in nature, and that leave to appeal is required.
