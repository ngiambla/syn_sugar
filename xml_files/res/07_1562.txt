 1 I have before me a notice of motion filed 23 August 2007 by the first and second respondents in the substantive proceedings, seeking an order for security for costs and consequential orders. 2 For convenience, in this judgment I shall continue to refer to the applicant in the substantive proceedings as "the applicant" notwithstanding that it is the respondent to the present notice of motion, and the respondents in the substantive proceedings as "the respondents".
 The applicant alleges, inter alia , breach of s 52 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("TP Act") by the first and second respondents, and seeks damages in the sum of $842,865.20 and an order that the relevant agreements be set aside. 5 I note that the first respondent also seeks declaratory relief against the applicant by way of cross-claim. 6 The first and second respondents filed a defence and cross-claim in these proceedings on 2 March 2007.
 Exercise of discretion by the Court 32 Although the jurisdiction of the Court to order security for costs is enlivened in this case by what are reasons to believe that the applicant could not satisfy a costs order if it were unsuccessful, the decision to make the order is nonetheless at the discretion of the Court.
