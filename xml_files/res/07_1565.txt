 Although the substance of the protected information was provided to Mr Ngaronoa, his counsel submitted that he was not told, nor was it apparent on the face of the material, that the conduct would be taken into account in the exercise of the Minister's discretion. 13 Mr Ngaronoa's counsel also contended that this proceeding involves a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation.
 To do so was said to be to take into account an irrelevant consideration. 48 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Huynh [2004] FCAFC 256 ; (2004) 139 FCR 505, Kiefel and Bennett JJ observed at [72] the Act does not state what factors the Minister is bound to consider in determining whether or not to cancel a visa.
 I do not consider it is a matter on which evidence of his subjective thought processes would have assisted. 91 Counsel for the Minister submitted that in any event the Minister was not obliged to satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness in relation to protected information under s 503A of the Act: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ball [2004] FCAFC 91 ; (2004) 138 FCR 450 at [30] , [90] --- [91].
