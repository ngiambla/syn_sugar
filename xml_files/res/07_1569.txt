 And as to the self-executing guillotine order, there was a variation by order 3 of the order made 1 October 2007 to order 4 of Spender J of 29 August 2007 with the result that if the respondent failed to produce the list in the manner and with the detail described in the order, by 4 pm on 2 October 2007, then, in the absence of any order to the contrary made before that time and date, all documents the subject of the application would be released to the applicant. 6 After the making of the order by Spender J, the solicitors for the respondent embarked upon a process of isolating documents which would be the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege.
 Those documents are electronic documents and there are 124 files referred to in the list which I understand contain many more documents than the number of files. 8 On 2 October 2007, at 26 minutes past 11 pm, a list was sent to the applicant by the respondent, by facsimile, which is described as 'MEL-12', that is exhibit 12 to the affidavit of Ms Lindley and in that document there is a covering letter in which the solicitors for the respondent say that: Pursuant to the consent orders dated 28 September 2007 (which is, I pause to add, a reference to the order made by consent on 1 October), please find enclosed a list of the documents for which privilege is claimed.
 And, of course, it is common ground that the material was sent in whatever form its substance might be, very late on the evening of 2 October 2007. 12 However, having regard to the observations in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 as to the importance of the attainment of justice between the parties, I am not persuaded that giving effect to a guillotine order as a final resolution of the matters of substance, ought to occur.
