 The Tribunal had regard to independent evidence which indicated the caste system was still operating in India and that a degree of discrimination and occasional oppression is experienced by scheduled caste members.
 However the independent evidence also demonstrated that the central government has taken active measures to redress discrimination although caste oppression regularly occurs and there is evidence of inter-caste violence. 9 The Tribunal accepted that the applicant may have suffered discrimination as a scheduled caste member and that he was a supporter of the rights of scheduled caste members.
 In my opinion, the approach of the Federal Magistrate and his Honour's conclusions were clearly correct. 18 In relation to the first ground, I agree with his Honour that there was no error of law in the Tribunal's finding that the applicant could relocate in India as it found that the persecution claimed to be suffered by the applicant was localised in rural areas.
