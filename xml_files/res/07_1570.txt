 Prior to the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Oakes SC, provided me with comprehensive written submissions outlining the scheme and setting out in detail the evidence necessary for me to make the orders at this hearing. 2 In accordance with the practice referred to by Gyles J in Peplin Limited [2007] FCA 1387 at [2] , I will not reproduce the submissions but I will mark them as MFI 1 and direct that they remain with the papers so that they may be available for inspection by any interested party. 3 Mr Oakes has taken me through the scheme booklet and the evidence in some detail this morning.
 Briefly, the scheme is proposed between HPAL, which is a company providing outsourced business services, inbound and outbound communication management, results processing and information management services, and its shareholders. 4 HPAL is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ('ASX').
 I am also satisfied that the issue referred to in [27] of Investa , namely, the "vesting free of encumbrances" term is sufficiently addressed. 6 There was some discussion of the provision of the implementation agreement under which HPAL has agreed to pay a "break fee" not exceeding $3 million if the scheme does not proceed.
