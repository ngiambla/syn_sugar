 Mr Aleksic deposed that 'we', referring, I assume, to himself and Mr Milicevic, wished to continue carrying on the business and to implement an agreement reached between them in more recent times to continue to carry on the business with a minimum of disruption to the Company and its customers, maintaining the business of the Company --- including preservation of the position of employees, staff, business reputation, and relationships with contractors, suppliers, and customers --- for the future conduct of the business. 14 This application has come before the Court on short notice.
 An income statement for the period 1 July to 11 September 2007 indicates that it traded at a profit of $71,769.45 in that period. 16 It is true that in the financial year ended 30 June 2006, the Company suffered a loss of $172,899.55 and that in the financial year ended 30 June 2007, it suffered a loss of $445,453.43.
 He indicates that this is not a picture which applies in relation to the Christmas/New Year period, but represents a general state of affairs for the balance of the year. 20 It seems to me that the shareholders/contributories and directors, namely Mr Milicevic and Mr Aleksic, made a fundamental mistake when they saw fit to put the Company into voluntary liquidation.
