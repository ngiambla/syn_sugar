 Subject therefore to the other subsections of ss 411 and 412 , the plaintiff is entitled to seek the exercise of the Court's discretion and make the orders. 15 Two preconditions for the exercise of the power in s 411 are provided for in s 411(2).
 In respect of each of the schemes, the authors opined that, in the absence of a superior proposal, on balance the schemes are in the best interests of the Adelaide Bank shareholders. 28 The Court needs to be satisfied that the Explanatory Statement has sufficient information to allow the members to make a commercial judgment.
 I respectfully agree with his Honour's reasons. 34 I am further satisfied that the directors have unanimously recommended the schemes of arrangement to all three classes of members of the plaintiff and that in doing so they have not acted otherwise than in accordance with their duties.
