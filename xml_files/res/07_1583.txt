 I do not know the reasons for the two adjournments and I treat the defendant as having indicated at the earliest opportunity that he would plead guilty to both charges. 33 Because of this, there will be a discount of 20 percent off the penalties that I would otherwise have imposed.
 Second, I accept that the defendant now appreciates the seriousness of his offence: the consequences that have already flowed from it have brought this home to him. 53 It seems to me that penalties in the nature of fines and community service orders are appropriate. 54 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the NSW Act) provides in s 8 for community service orders.
