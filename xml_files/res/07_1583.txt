 In truth he was involved in a Century 21 meeting in which consensus had been reached to embark on a campaign, which included the removal of MRE advertisements, and the defendant in fact coordinated and organised for MRE advertisements to be removed from the copies of the BMG that were in Century 21 offices. 10 The second charge relates to three pieces of evidence the defendant gave on 20 March 2006.
 I do not know the reasons for the two adjournments and I treat the defendant as having indicated at the earliest opportunity that he would plead guilty to both charges. 33 Because of this, there will be a discount of 20 percent off the penalties that I would otherwise have imposed.
 Counsel for the defendant submitted, and I agree, that the publicity that has already attended the ACCC's investigation and the defendant's prosecution in the fairly small community of the Blue Mountains will itself have had an adverse effect on the defendant. 38 On the hearing a statement by Kerry Bartlett MP, Federal Member for Macquarie, was tendered.
 Second, I accept that the defendant now appreciates the seriousness of his offence: the consequences that have already flowed from it have brought this home to him. 53 It seems to me that penalties in the nature of fines and community service orders are appropriate. 54 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the NSW Act) provides in s 8 for community service orders.
