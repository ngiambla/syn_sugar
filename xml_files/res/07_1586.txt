 Section 8(6) applies to injured employees who continue to be employed by the Commonwealth and, as is apparent from ' would have been increased if the employee had continued in that employment' , continues to operate in respect of employees after employment has ended.
 This separation is emphasised in s 8(9B), which separates the calculations under ss 8(1) to 8(8) and the increases or reductions under s 8(9). 30 Section 8(9B) refers both to increases in remuneration payable to the individual employee and to increases payable to the class of employees to which a former employee had belonged.
 This in turn requires the normal weekly earnings to be reduced under s 8(10). 38 The second construction differentiates between the normal weekly earnings of the individual employee as calculated under subs (6) and the increase or reduction applicable to the employee as a member of a class of employees by operation of subs (9).
 However, the words could also indicate that, once the injured employee has ceased employment, additional or further increases after that cessation are by reference to the Wage Cost Index only. 41 The third construction is that the normal weekly earnings are as calculated under subs (6) and as increased or reduced by the application of subs (9) while the injured employee remains employed.
