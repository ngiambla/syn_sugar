 The [appellant] has indicated that although not a member of TIKKO, he does as a matter of fact have knowledge that the authorities would consider highly valuable intelligence concerning TIKKO members, information which presently the authorities may not realise he has.
 A finding that the appellant is not likely to come to the attention of the authorities because of his deceased brother's activities says nothing of the possibility that the Turkish authorities may wish to make use of the appellant's knowledge or presumed knowledge to further its fight against TIKKO.
