 The fourth was that he could be targeted by the authorities "as a leg-in, a means by which information could be gleaned about identity and operations of the [TIKKO]". 7 The fourth limb was developed in a written submission filed with the tribunal by the appellant's migration agent.
 The [appellant] has indicated that although not a member of TIKKO, he does as a matter of fact have knowledge that the authorities would consider highly valuable intelligence concerning TIKKO members, information which presently the authorities may not realise he has.
 There is no precise standard for determining when an issue is "raised squarely", but it is clear the tribunal is obliged to consider any claim that is apparent on the face of the material before it. 15 The contention that the tribunal failed to consider the risk to the appellant based on his family's political profile cannot be sustained.
 A finding that the appellant is not likely to come to the attention of the authorities because of his deceased brother's activities says nothing of the possibility that the Turkish authorities may wish to make use of the appellant's knowledge or presumed knowledge to further its fight against TIKKO.
