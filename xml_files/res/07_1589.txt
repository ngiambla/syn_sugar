 In each case I ordered that the certificate of taxation be set aside and the bill of costs the subject of the certificate be remitted to the taxing officer for taxation in accordance with the reasons for judgment of the Court. 6 In the taxation judgment at first instance at [22]-[27] I identified the issues raised by the taxation appeals.
 I reserve my rights to claim remuneration and disbursements for the period on and after 22 October 2003 in relation to the finalisation of the matters presently before the Court and otherwise in respect of the estate of the former bankrupt. " 26 As I noted in the taxation judgment at first instance, it is not clear what Mr Pantzer sought to achieve by the last of the two paragraphs above.
 It may be that he simply wished to place on record his understanding that the orders made on 21 October 2003 did not reach to claims for remuneration and disbursements for any period commencing thereafter. 27 The effect of the orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003 is one of the issues that remains to be resolved in this proceeding.
 It seems to me that the Full Court has made clear that a trustee, or former trustee, is entitled to recover remuneration, costs, charges and expenses under the Act wherever he or she "has been properly involved in the litigation as an incident of having acted as a trustee charged with the responsibility of administering the bankrupt's estate" .
