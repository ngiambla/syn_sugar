 On 6 February 2007 the proceedings were transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('FMCA'). 2 On 14 August 2007 the FMCA refused to grant a stay of the proceedings pending a further proposed application to the High Court and ordered Mr Croker to provide security for costs in favour of the Commonwealth before his case proceeded further.
 In other proceedings involving Mr Croker in the Supreme Court of New South Wales ('the Supreme Court') the same conclusion was reached about the same address --- Darlinghurst Post Office ( Croker v Ewan; Croker v Challoner [2000] NSWCA 186).
 It is not clear whether the FMCA took this matter into account and so I will not, independently, give it any weight. 16 It was pointed out also before the FMCA that Mr Croker had failed to comply with an outstanding costs order made by the Supreme Court in one of his earlier attempts to litigate about the allegedly defective cufflinks (see Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2005] NSWSC 994 ; (2005) 194 FLR 366).
