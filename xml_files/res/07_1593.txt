 On 6 February 2007 the proceedings were transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('FMCA'). 2 On 14 August 2007 the FMCA refused to grant a stay of the proceedings pending a further proposed application to the High Court and ordered Mr Croker to provide security for costs in favour of the Commonwealth before his case proceeded further.
 In other proceedings involving Mr Croker in the Supreme Court of New South Wales ('the Supreme Court') the same conclusion was reached about the same address --- Darlinghurst Post Office ( Croker v Ewan; Croker v Challoner [2000] NSWCA 186).
