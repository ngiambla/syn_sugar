 He made various complaints about the substantive merits of my decision and alleged procedural injustices, but I do not see that as relevant for present purposes. 4 Section 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) gives the Court a wide discretion to award costs in a proceeding.
 Traditionally costs only depart from the ordinary party-party basis where there is a particular or special circumstance: Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225, at 232-233 per Shepphard J and Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234 per Black CJ and French J.
 They submitted that full compensation of costs as innocent respondents was appropriate where an action has been commenced or continued where "an applicant, properly advised, should have know that he had no chance of success... and must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive": Fountain Selected Meats (Sales) Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd (1988) 81 ALR 397 at 401. 7 In Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd [2006] FCA 1537 Kenny J at [26] recently noted that courts have from time to time overcome a reluctance to order indemnity costs against self-represented litigants: Bhagat v Global Custodians [2002] FCAFC 51 and Ogawa v The University of Melbourne (No 2) [2004] FCA 1275.
