 Finally, it submits that the balance of convenience falls in favour of the Court exercising its power to grant the relief, and thereby protects what it claims is the " very strong public interest " in ensuring StoresOnline complies with the terms of its undertaking. 6 StoresOnline submits that it has complied with most of the terms of the undertaking it gave to the ACCC, and that any breaches were minor and should not persuade the Court to exercise its discretion to grant the relief sought.
 There is nothing in the language of s 87B which limits the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the ACCC's application and, if appropriate on the evidence, make the orders it sees fit. 11 StoresOnline disagrees with the proposition that the TPA does not exclusively set out the powers of this Court to make injunctions in respect of relief sought under the TPA.
 BREACH OF UNDERTAKING 17 Once it is established that a respondent has breached a term of an undertaking given to the ACCC, the Court may make an order directing the respondent to comply with that term of the undertaking (s 87B(4)(a)) and any other orders it deems appropriate (s 87B(4)(d)). 18 In this case, breaches of certain terms of the undertaking given by StoresOnline are conceded.
