 Accordingly, there is some urgency attendant on a decision as to whether those hearing dates be vacated. 3 In summary, the applicants in the substantive proceedings seek to recover alleged shortfalls in respect of profit guarantees which were the subject of a covenant in a Share Sale Agreement executed on 17 December 1997.
 In relation to this claim, the applicants have placed reliance on two reports prepared by Ernst Young and a report produced by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. 5 In relation to these claims the respondents have previously sought source financial documentation of the second applicant, and any working papers that might exist in relation to the report of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, so as to obtain expert evidence to meet and answer the reports relied upon by the applicants.
 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu had not retained its working papers in relation to the report of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. 6 On 12 September 2007 the respondents filed a notice of motion for a stay of the substantive proceedings pursuant to Order 20 rule 2 Federal Court Rules . 7 The notice of motion filed 12 September 2007 was heard by Tracey J on 26 September 2007. 8 During the course of the hearing of 26 September 2007 his Honour queried the terms of the amended statement of claim, in light of the manner in which the applicants were proposing to put their case at trial (transcript 26 September 2007 page 33 lines 33-36).
 After considering comments of his Honour, Counsel submitted that there was no need to amend the amended statement of claim further. 9 In light of submissions by Counsel for the applicants, Counsel for the respondents accepted that it was not necessary to press the stay application.
