 1 The first respondent (' Minister ') has filed a motion seeking an order dismissing what purports to be an appeal by the applicant from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (' AAT ') given on 25 June 2007.
 Section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth), which provides for an appeal on a question of law from a decision of the AAT, does not apply to a privative clause decision or to a ' purported privative clause decision ': Migration Act , ss 483 , 5E (definition of ' purported privative clause decision ').
 Had the applicant filed an application for judicial review in proper form, the Court would have had jurisdiction to entertain the application under s 476A(1)(b) of the Migration Act , since the notice of appeal was filed within the time limit specified in s 477A(1) of the Migration Act .
