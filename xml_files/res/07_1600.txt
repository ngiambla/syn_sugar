 Mr Brereton says that Mango entered into the contract as trustee for WRVM which in turn acted on behalf of two joint venturers, GDK and Young Turks Pty Ltd (Young Turks).
 He also says that Mango gave up its interest in the Mews land in favour of WRVM when Mr Brereton told him that funding was not available.
 Mr Brereton described the contract as a "turnkey contract for the development over time of [the Mews] [R]etirement [V]illage. " This explains why the contract deals with two discrete transactions: the sale of the Mews land and the construction by WRVM of a retirement village.
 The details of the construction are described in the contract. 4 The "purchase price" payable by The Mews Village Nominees under the sale contract was $93,425,000.
