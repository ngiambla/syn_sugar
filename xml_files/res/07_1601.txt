 On 22 December 2006, the Authority notified OzEpulse that it had been unsuccessful in its application for the grant of consent for the export of wheat to Yemen. 20 There were a number of benefits for OzEpulse and OzEgrain in being able to supply wheat in bulk as opposed to bags and containers.
 In the proceeding, OzEpulse and OzEgrain seek judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (the Judicial Review Act) of the decisions of the Minister in declining to agree in writing and of the Authority in refusing to give its consent.
 In the event, the Minister consented to one application in full, for export of 300,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq, and consented to another application in part, for export of 500,000 tonnes of wheat to Indonesia by Agracorp Pty Ltd/CBH (CBH).
