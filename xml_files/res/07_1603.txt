 I would not wish to give currency to any notion to the contrary. 47 On the present state of the evidence, it is not shown that disclosure to DR Capital and CRA would be for a legitimate purpose of the proceeding. 48 It is important to note that the officers of DR Capital and CRA are not legal practitioners owing to the Court the duties of officers of the Court.
 There would not be available against them the additional and special sanctions that are available against solicitors and barristers for a breach of the implied undertaking. 49 It seems sufficient for me to express the concluded view that I have stated above, and to leave the implied undertaking given by Mr Dale and the other eight applicants and their legal representatives in the proceedings to operate so as to preclude disclosure to the DR Capital and CRA.
 Veda has invited Mr Dale and his legal representatives to propose any means (other than an applicant's consent) by which it may be lawful for them to disclose personal information contained in, for example, Mr Dale's credit information file to the other eight applicants and to the representatives of DR Capital. 52 Mr Dale has not contended that the para (m) exception applies.
