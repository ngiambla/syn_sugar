 The appeal has proceeded upon the assumption that Mr Parry suffers at least from two conditions, diabetes mellitus and chronic liver failure. 3 It is the Secretary's contention that the Tribunal found as well a third condition described as "shortness of breath" and it is in respect of this alleged finding that the questions of law founding the appeal are said to arise.
 The essence of the Secretary's challenge is that if such a finding was made the Tribunal failed properly to apply cl 4 of the Introduction to the Tables for the Assessment of Work-Related Impairment to be found in Sched 1B of the Social Security Act .
 At the time of the application his liver condition was also stable, but was causing him symptoms and the Tribunal finds that it was correctly assessed at 10 points under Table 11.1 of the Guide to the Tables to the Assessment of Work Related Impairment and for Disability Support Pension.
