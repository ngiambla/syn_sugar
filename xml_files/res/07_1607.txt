 Section 719(4) of the WR Act prescribes a maximum penalty of $33,000 for breach of a certified agreement. 9 The WR Act applies to the breach of cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement: see s 719 of the WR Act read with cll 1 and 6 of Sched 7 to WR Act and s 717 of the WR Act .
 The primary breach is that relating to cl 17.4 of the 2005 Enterprise Agreement. 10 The breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA is entirely reliant upon, and arises out of, substantially the same course of conduct as the primary breach: Gibbs v The Mayor, Councillors and Citizens of the City of Altona (1992) 37 FCR 216.
 Accordingly, any penalty would be determined by reference to the "totality principle": CPSU, The Community and Public Sector Union v Telstra Corporation Limited (2001) 108 IR 228. 11 For those reasons, it is strictly unnecessary for me to conclude whether the WR Act or the IR Act applies to the breach of cl 9.1 of the TRA.
