 Most of the remaining paragraphs concerned the merits of the applicant's claims before the Tribunal and invited an inquiry that this Court was not at liberty to make. 6 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had complied with its statutory obligations and was entitled to proceed in the appellant's absence.
 The applicant's draft notice of appeal claims that: (a) the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court involved an important exercise of power; (b) the Tribunal failed to provide the applicant with procedural fairness; and (c) he is entitled to a protection visa.
 The Tribunal is, however, authorised by s 426A to make a decision in an applicant's absence if the applicant has been invited under s 425 to appear before the Tribunal and does not appear in accordance with that invitation.
 In addition, as I have already said, the applicant's claim that he is entitled to a protection visa is not a matter for this Court, since it seeks to review the merits of the Tribunal's finding and the Court cannot review these merits.
