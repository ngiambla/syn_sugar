 The Tribunal is, however, authorised by s 426A to make a decision in an applicant's absence if the applicant has been invited under s 425 to appear before the Tribunal and does not appear in accordance with that invitation.
 In addition, as I have already said, the applicant's claim that he is entitled to a protection visa is not a matter for this Court, since it seeks to review the merits of the Tribunal's finding and the Court cannot review these merits.
