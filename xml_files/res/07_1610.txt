 Reorganisation and the Demerger Scheme 21 The PBL Scheme Booklet makes it clear that the PBL directors recommend not only the PBL Scheme, but also a "Recommended Proposal" which includes a "Reorganisation" and the Demerger Scheme. 22 It is the Crown Initial Shareholders who will vote on the Demerger Scheme.
 As noted earlier, in substance it is the PBL Shareholders who, by voting in favour of the Demerger Scheme Advisory Resolution and the Financial Assistance Resolution, will determine whether the Demerger Scheme and ancillary resolutions are to be approved by the Crown Initial Shareholders. 33 Under the Demerger Scheme, each PBL Scheme Participant to whom Crown shares were issued under the PBL Scheme, will receive a transfer (from Crown, the parent company of PBL) of one CMH share for every Crown share held by that PBL Scheme Participant.
 Clause 4.2 of the Demerger Scheme provides that each Demerger Scheme Participant, including the Nominee on behalf of the Ineligible Overseas Shareholders, directs Crown to apply and Crown must apply the Capital Reduction Entitlement of that Demerger Scheme Participant as consideration for the transfer by Crown to that Demerger Scheme Participant of the number of CMH shares equal to the number of Crown shares registered in the name of that Demerger Scheme Participant on the Demerger Scheme Record Date.
 Further, that section states that Demerger Scheme Participants will not have the option of taking any entitlement to the Capital Reduction Amount in cash and that the CMH shares to which the Demerger Scheme Participants are entitled represent all the CMH shares on issue. 37 The Crown directors recommend in favour of the Demerger Scheme and Crown's Capital Reduction Resolution, provided the PBL Shareholders vote in favour of the Demerger Scheme Advisory Resolution.
