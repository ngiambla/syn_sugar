 PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS 8 At the outset of the hearing counsel for Mr Siminton made what he described as four "preliminary objections" to the District Registrar's charges. 9 The first objection was that s 65A of the Act was "unconstitutional" and that this precluded the laying of contempt charges.
 As the Full Court pointed out in Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129 and 137-8: "An order made by a superior court of record stands and is bound to be observed even though it may ultimately be determined that the order should not have been made or was made without jurisdiction.
 CONTEMPT 14 In Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 497-8 Merkel J summarised the current state of the law on when disobedience of a Court order will constitute a contempt of court.
