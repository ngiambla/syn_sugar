 In any event this refusal to provide the information requested can hardly be sheeted home to the applicant. 45 It should be noted that the Tribunal did not actually make a finding that the medical certificate was not genuine.
 However, it is not, in my opinion, arguably, relevant to the exercise of discretion for the Tribunal to have concluded that, had the applicant attended at the Tribunal hearing on 23 August 2006 instead of going to the medical practice, then if it were persuaded that he was demonstrably not well at the hearing then it would have adjourned to another day.
 It may be that whilst he was ill prior to 23 August 2006 that he was not so unwell such as to cause him to conclude that he would not be able to attend the hearing on 23 August 2006.
