 The Tribunal, by letter also dated 4 November 2002, mailed to the appellant at that address, acknowledged this as a change of address, although this was returned to the Tribunal marked "return to send" on 6 December 2002.
 Approximately six months later in a letter dated 30 May 2003, the Tribunal wrote to the appellant at this address and invited the appellant to attend a hearing on 9 July 2003 to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of his claims.
 The letter of 4 November 2002 did not constitute notice to the Tribunal of the address for service or the residential address of the appellant, even if it were from him.
