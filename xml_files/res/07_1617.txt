 In respect of the parts of the National Foods' CFP requirements supplied by the other, both Visy and Amcor would tender prices to National Foods which were generally higher than those submitted by the incumbent supplier. 141 The National Foods Price Understanding was arrived at in discussions between Mr Carroll and Mr Laidlaw in mid to late April 2002.
 Mr Laidlaw said that he was concerned that Visy's prices for some product lines were below Amcor's current prices and that the Visy tender prices were too low. 155 On 1 July 2003 Amcor submitted a proposal to supply CFP to Parmalat incorporating a price increase over Amcor's then current supply prices.
 This exchange confirmed to Mr Laidlaw that the Visy prices provided by Mr Scammell to Amcor were correct. 189 On 8 October Amcor submitted a revised tender process to Hardy incorporating the lower prices for product lines referred to in the meetings with Mr Scammell and Ms Molenaar. 190 In October Visy also submitted revised prices.
