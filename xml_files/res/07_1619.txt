 I think I am entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that this period of some four and a half months is not unreasonably long by reference to the periods that one sees in similar provisions in schemes of the present kind. 24 The no-talk and no-shop provisions are related to the concept of a "Competing Proposal".
 There is a "fiduciary carve out" from the no-talk provision in cl 11.3 of the MIA. 25 By cl 11.4, CFI undertakes, during the no-shop period, to inform Sunsuper of any competing approaches made to CFI. 26 Importantly, Sunsuper has no relevant interest in shares in CFI (in contrast to the position that prevailed in APN 62 ACSR 400).
 Accordingly, there is no scope for an argument that Sunsuper used its position as a CFI shareholder with "representation" on CFI's Board of Directors, somehow to lock the CFI shareholders into the Scheme. 27 I turn now to the break fee for which cl 12 of the MIA provides.
