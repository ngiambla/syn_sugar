 The application was not filed until 23 April 2007, well outside the time provided for in s 477 of the Act . 7 On 19 June 2007 the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate.
 An affidavit and draft notice of appeal in support of the application asserts that the applicant disagrees with the decision of the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal because the Tribunal's decision was affected by error of law.
 No particulars were provided. 8 At the hearing counsel for the Minister advised the Court that the Minister would consent to orders granting the applicant leave to appeal from the Federal Magistrates' decision, setting aside the decision and remitting the matter to the Federal Magistrates' Court for a final hearing.
 The Minister felt bound to consent to such orders because of the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 which had been decided after the Federal Magistrate had made his decision.
