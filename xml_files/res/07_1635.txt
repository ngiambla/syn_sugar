 It accepted an expression of expert opinion that the appropriate diagnosis in respect of Mr Croker's hand condition was 'undifferentiated somatoform disorder' and that the diagnosis of RSI was simply an alternative explanation or diagnosis for that condition. 10 The Tribunal took the view that Mr Croker's functional impairment should properly be understood as involving activity limitations which he has imposed in order to forestall or avoid the recurrence of the symptoms he describes as RSI.
 Having regard to the terms of Table 6, the Tribunal concluded that the appropriate rating for Mr Croker's impairment was 20 points. 12 As this gave Mr Croker an impairment of 20 points or more for the purpose of s 94(1) , it was necessary for the Tribunal to determine if it was satisfied that Mr Croker's impairment was 'of itself sufficient to prevent [him] from doing any work within the next 2 years' (s 94(2)(a)). 13 On the issue of whether Mr Croker has a continuing inability to work, the Tribunal noted that 'work' in the context of s 94 meant at least 30 hours work per week at award wages or above in an Australian job.
 He suggested that the Tribunal had 'cherry picked' the medical reports rather than taking them all into account. 21 Mr Croker's submissions made it plain that he did not challenge the meaning that the Tribunal attributed to the words 'of itself' ; his concern was with the findings of fact that the Tribunal made by reference to the medical reports.
 However, I do not accept that the Act discloses an intention that a person with tertiary qualifications is to be regarded as a person with a continuing inability to work, and thus as a person entitled to taxpayer funded DSP, just because the person's impairment prevents him or her from undertaking professional or other high status employment.
