 The section does not apply to conduct of the respondent carrying out its statutory function of supplying data in response to individual searches. 63 Notwithstanding this finding, I note that the respondent's case was predicated on the basis that s 46 potentially applied to all conduct of the respondent relevant to these proceedings (submission of Mr Hinson SC TS p 385 ll 30-43).
 Further, I note that, notwithstanding para 7 of the amended statement of claim, Mr Hinson SC also submitted --- and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing --- that the respondent did not understand the applicant's case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (note TS p 370 ll 12-17).
 Similarly, it cannot be said that the proposal of the respondent had the purpose of deterring or preventing the applicant from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market to the benefit of other licensees --- the proposal to exclude the Excluded Data from the data supplied by the respondent was identical in respect of all licensees.
 An assessment of the purpose of the respondent is an issue for the court to decide, based on the evidence before it. 165 In my view, the purpose of the respondent in engaging in the conduct complained of was not that of deterring or preventing the applicant from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market.
