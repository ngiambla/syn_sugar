 Further, I note that, notwithstanding para 7 of the amended statement of claim, Mr Hinson SC also submitted --- and this was not contested by Mr Jackson QC at the hearing --- that the respondent did not understand the applicant's case to assert that the respondent had a substantial degree of power in the Retail Market (note TS p 370 ll 12-17).
 An assessment of the purpose of the respondent is an issue for the court to decide, based on the evidence before it. 165 In my view, the purpose of the respondent in engaging in the conduct complained of was not that of deterring or preventing the applicant from engaging in competitive conduct in the Retail Market.
