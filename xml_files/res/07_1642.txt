 1 In the substantive proceeding, the applicants, PZ Cussons Australia Pty Ltd ('PZ Cussons') and PZ Cussons (International) Limited ('PZ Cussons International'), are in the business of manufacturing a range of dishwashing detergent products under various trade marks, including "Morning Fresh" and "Cussons".
 She said that she had compared the labelling and packaging of the alleged counterfeit products with the Thai "Morning Fresh" and concluded that "[b]ased on my knowledge of the Thai Morning Fresh that is currently made and has been made since 1998 it is clear to me that the [alleged counterfeit] Products were not made by PZ Cussons Thailand. " She also deposed that "[n]o other person or organisation is or has been authorised to make products bearing the trade marks "Cussons" and "Morning Fresh" in Thailand during this time".
 In the light of this evidence, it appears unlikely that Rosa Dora's use of the Australian trade marks on the products sold to Mr Tassone was licensed or authorised by the registered owner, PZ Cussons International. 28 The respondents' evidence was comparatively brief.
