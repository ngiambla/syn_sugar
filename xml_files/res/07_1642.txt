 1 In the substantive proceeding, the applicants, PZ Cussons Australia Pty Ltd ('PZ Cussons') and PZ Cussons (International) Limited ('PZ Cussons International'), are in the business of manufacturing a range of dishwashing detergent products under various trade marks, including "Morning Fresh" and "Cussons".
 In the light of this evidence, it appears unlikely that Rosa Dora's use of the Australian trade marks on the products sold to Mr Tassone was licensed or authorised by the registered owner, PZ Cussons International. 28 The respondents' evidence was comparatively brief.
