 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Smith FM ( SZKOP v Minister for Immigration [2007] FMCA 1336) dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) handed down on 27 March 2007, which affirmed the decision of the delegate of the Minister not to grant the applicant/appellant a protection visa.
 The Tribunal dealt with the situation of practise in Australia as follows: "Given that there are no restrictions on Falun Gong in Australia and that it is practised openly and freely at public sites in Sydney and elsewhere I am not satisfied that there is a basis for concluding that the Applicant has any deep or genuine commitment to the faith or that he would practise it in China but for the fact that to do so could expose him to severe punishment.
