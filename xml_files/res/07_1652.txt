 The Tribunal asserted that such treatment was not acceptable but found it was not serious or widespread as to indicate that ethnic Chinese in the appellant's area faced a real chance of persecution for reason of their race alone. 10 The Tribunal found the appellant's examples of his family's past experiences did not alter the view that the fear of the appellant arising from general discrimination was not well-founded.
 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of Convention-related persecution arising from the Indonesian authorities' response to other forms of harm. 12 The Tribunal noted that the appellant's wife was Muslim and that she disliked the attitude of native Indonesians.
