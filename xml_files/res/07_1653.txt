 A psychological report for the appellant husband, along with statutory declarations from the appellants, were also provided to the Tribunal. 5 On 26 October 2006 the Tribunal wrote to the appellants indicating inconsistencies between the statement in the initial protection visa application and the written submission made to the Tribunal.
 The Tribunal accepted that the home of the appellants was destroyed in the incident on 9 November 2005 and this would be sufficient for them to fear for their safety and to want to leave, however this did not bring the appellants under the Refugees Convention definition of a refugee. 9 The Tribunal accepted the appellants were of a Chinese ethnicity and Christian and considered the details in the psychologist report which revealed the appellant husband had been caught up in rioting in 1998.
 The Tribunal presented independent country information to the appellants and although accepting that there were problems securing permits to build churches in Indonesia as referred to by the appellant husband, the Tribunal did not accept on the evidence before it that there was a real chance that either the appellant wife or husband would be persecuted for reasons of religion if they return to Indonesia now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.
 His Honour however outlined that the Court could not take issue with the factual findings of the Tribunal and could only scrutinise the decision of the Tribunal as to whether or not there was a jurisdictional error. 12 The Federal Magistrate asserted that there was no obligation upon the Tribunal to make further enquiries.
