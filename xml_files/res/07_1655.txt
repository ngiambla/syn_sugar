 A further anomaly is the fact that the request to Colonial was not made until 11 October 2001, notwithstanding, that the instructions were purportedly received by a facsimile letter dated 2 October 2001.
 Once again, the signature that appears on the letter of 13 November 2001 has an apostrophe between the " n " and the final " s " of Stevens.
 If someone pretending to be Mr Stevens was in Penrith on 14 November 2001, it is anomalous that he did not bring the letter of 13 November with him.
