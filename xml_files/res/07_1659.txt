 Prior to that date ASIC informed the parties and the Court that it was objecting to the production for inspection of thirty-six specified documents and copies of the transcripts of examination of all persons examined by ASIC during the course of its investigation on the ground of public interest immunity privilege.
 The effect of the orders sought by ASIC was that the hearing of its objection to the production of the transcripts and the documents on the ground of public interest immunity privilege would be made ex parte , in camera and with no other party or person present to put opposing submissions. 18 I was extremely unhappy about adopting the procedure proposed by ASIC but, after giving the applicant and the respondents the opportunity to make submissions in relation to ASIC's proposal for the procedure for the hearing of its public interest immunity privilege claim, I reluctantly acceded to ASIC's submissions.
 ASIC contended that the applicant would not be able to say whether in order to advance its claims against Multiplex it was necessary to inspect the documents in respect of which the claim for public interest immunity privilege was made until it had inspected the unchallenged documents.
 Put another way, ASIC submitted that in order for the applicant to overcome a claim for public interest immunity privilege it had to show that the documents, produced under the subpoena, which it had not inspected were necessary for the administration of justice and then have the Court weigh the impact on the administration of justice of those documents being withheld against the interest sought to be protected by the claim for public interest immunity privilege.
