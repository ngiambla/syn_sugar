 It also noted that the applicant had been advised that the Tribunal was unable to make a decision in his favour on the information provided in his protection visa application and in the application for review.
 In this affidavit, he asserted that he had an arguable case for a protection visa since he was a member of "the Akali Dal National Party, which is the representative of the Sikh faith in the Indian Punjab" and repeated matters going to the merits of his claim.
 The Tribunal could not grant him a protection visa unless it was so satisfied. 14 The Tribunal's decision was open to it, particularly in view of the fact that the applicant did not attend the hearing after being invited to do so.
