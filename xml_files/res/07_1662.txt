 My fellow claimants and I are certain of that fact because we know our extended family well, and through that knowledge we are aware that the other four claimants and I are the individuals who fall within the defining characteristics of those who have maintained traditional knowledge and observances, so as to be qualified to speak for our traditional country. i.
 The members of our extended family who have not learned and who do not now live by the traditional laws and customs of grandfather Bill Kite and his ancestors, so that they are not qualified to claim traditional country are, from my knowledge of the extended family, content that my fellow claimants and I hold the traditional knowledge and that we perform the traditional role of exercising the traditional claims upon, and responsibilities toward our grandfather's country. j.
 Of the five claim group members, John Kite alone is the grandchild of Bill Kite. (ii) As I indicated above, the Schedule F description of native title rights and interests suggests on its face that Aboriginal peoples other than the claim group acknowledge the same traditional laws and observe the same customs in relation to the claim area.
 In response to the State's submission on Schedule F, Mr Kite has asserted in written submissions that: "[b]y acknowledging that there may be others with native title rights and interests in parts of the SAYN claim area the SAYN claimants are not inevitably asserting that they have failed to include all possible members of their claimant group in their claim.
