 The application of s 8(10)(a) in conjunction with s 8(1) and s 19(3) of the SRC Act thus brings about the expected result, it is said, that an employee incapacitated for work cannot receive compensation each week for earnings he or she would not have received in any event.
 The statutory mechanism for bringing about that result is the reduction of 'normal weekly earnings' struck in the two week period prior to injury (derived by the preceding subsections of s 8) by the amount of the excess beyond that which would have been the earnings of the employee.
 In a case where the earnings would have been nothing, the normal weekly earnings, for the purposes of the formula, are, in consequence, reduced to nothing. 13 The respondent says that s 8(10)(a) is simply not engaged in the present circumstances for the reason that the subsection can only operate in circumstances where the normal weekly earnings of Ms Burgess are capable of being compared with (so as to determine whether any relevant reduction should occur) 'the amount per week of the earnings that the employee would receive if he or she were not incapacitated for work'.
 Because the expression of the compensation for incapacity is determined according to a formula that takes account of earnings (founded upon adjusted normal weekly earnings), it seems difficult to accept that compensation under the Act for incapacity for work as a result of an injury is anything other than truly compensatory.
 In those circumstances, s 8(10)(a) seeks to compare the normal weekly earnings (as determined) with the quantum of those corresponding earnings and reduce the normal weekly earnings for the purposes of the s 19(3) formula by the amount of the excess. 26 Had the legislature intended that suspension of employment would bring about a reduction of normal weekly earnings to nil for the purposes of a formula quantifying the amount of weekly compensation under s 19(3) during a period of incapacity for work, the legislature would have expressly provided for that result.
 As to the first question, had I formed the view that s 8(10)(a) is enlivened and operates in circumstances where an employee has been suspended from employment, I would conclude that the phrase 'the amount per week of the earnings that the employee would receive' includes an amount of zero.
