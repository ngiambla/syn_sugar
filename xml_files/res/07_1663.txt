 The statutory mechanism for bringing about that result is the reduction of 'normal weekly earnings' struck in the two week period prior to injury (derived by the preceding subsections of s 8) by the amount of the excess beyond that which would have been the earnings of the employee.
 Because the regime is compensatory, the determination of normal weekly earnings (as the foundation for the ultimate calculation of the compensatory payment) is to be reached having regard to whether the statutory calculation (according to s 8(1) to s 8(9) of the SRC Act) of normal weekly earnings is greater than the amount an employee would have received had he or she not been incapacitated for work by reason of the injury.
 The subsection assumes continuity of employment and the receipt of earnings and therefore a continuity of performance of the contract. 25 It seems to me that s 8(10)(a) contemplates a circumstance in which an employee (that is, relevantly here, 'a person who is employed by the Commonwealth', s 5(1) SRC Act) 'continues to be employed by the Commonwealth' in the sense that such a person continues to provide service to the Commonwealth and correspondingly continues to receive earnings from the Commonwealth.
