 Three of the others relate to events in Victoria and the remaining three to events in Queensland. 3 All nine are brought by individuals on behalf of themselves and others whose complaints concern information provided by Veda to credit providers relating to the creditworthiness of the applicants and of the group members they respectively represent.
 I accept Veda's submission that a person reading the description would be left in doubt as to whether the person fell within the group if the reference to "Clearouts" or "Clearouts (watched)" was in only one of the three, and, in particular, if it appeared only in a database or credit information file but not in a credit report.
 I note that the phrase still appears in the proposed further amended application (as at 10.10.07). 19 (3) Paragraph 1(c) of the proposed further amended application (as at 03.10.07) refers to a document "referred to in Schedule A", but there is no Schedule A, other than the one annexed to the proposed further amended statement of claim. 20 (4) Paragraph 1(c) concludes with the words "which ... the Respondent also described in the Respondent's internet user guide as a "serious credit infringement (confirmed clearouts only)".
 I will address these by reference to paragraph 5 and its subparagraphs in the proposed further amended application (as at 10.10.07): (i) Paragraphs 7(a) and 7(b) of the amended statement of claim do not plead an obligation owed by Veda to the applicant and to each of the group members , although I think this is implied.
