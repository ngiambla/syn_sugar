 The Tribunal accepted that she was a member of such a social group and that she would have a well-founded fear of persecution by her former husband if it were not for her ability to relocate within Bulgaria. 3 The Tribunal, in considering that question, applied the law as it was understood at that time which was prior to the decisions of the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 237 ALR 634 and S ZFDV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 237 ALR 660.
 The learned Federal Magistrate considered the appeal on the basis of the existing decisions of the Full Court of this Court, namely, Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 and NAIZ v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 , and found that there was no error in the Tribunal's conclusion based upon those principles.
