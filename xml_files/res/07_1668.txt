 Options 10 The directors of Bolnisi, or, where relevant, their associates on their behalf, have entered into Option Deeds with Coeur, under which Coeur will have an option to buy the shares in Bolnisi in which the directors or their associates have an interest.
 Cash and scrip components of the Scheme consideration 11 Under cl 5.2 of the Scheme, on the business day prior to the Implementation Date, Coeur is to deposit in cleared funds an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the cash component of the Scheme consideration into a trust account operated by Bolnisi as trustee for the Scheme Shareholders, to be held by Bolnisi on trust for them (except that any interest on the amounts deposited, less bank fees and other charges, is to be to Coeur's account).
 Of course the break fee is not payable by Bolnisi merely because its shareholders do not agree to the Scheme. 25 I discussed no shop and no talk and break free provisions in Re APN News Media Ltd (2007) 62 ACSR 400 at [25]---[55] and in Re Investa Properties Ltd [2007] FCA 1104 at [31] ---[35].
