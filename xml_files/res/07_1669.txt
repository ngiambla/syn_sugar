 In other words, McGrath Australasia has given its consent under cll 8.3 or 8.4(2) to those franchisees but in no case has it exercised its right under cl 8.4(3) to impose an obligation to conduct a property management business on any franchisee. 15 The applicants seek an interlocutory injunction restraining the respondents from entering into any franchise agreement in relation to the marketing and sale of real property in New South Wales unless the prospective franchisee agrees to sell its rent roll to Run Property, or sub-contracts its present and future property management business to Run Property and promises to refer any future management opportunities to Run Property.
 It would, however, be a breach of cl 13.1.1 which prevents the McGrath group from having even an indirect involvement in a property management business. 21 Indeed, the view I presently hold is that if McGrath Ltd or McGrath Australasia becomes involved in any way in the property management business conducted by a franchisee there is a good chance that they will contravene cl 13.1.
 I have a letter from OpenDoor which advises that the property management business is "[l]ocated at McGrath Neutral Bay / Mosman, 3 Young Street, Neutral Bay. " This is, as it seems to me, a deliberate attempt to establish a relationship or link between the OpenDoor business and the McGrath name.
 That is likely to constitute an indirect involvement by McGrath Ltd, through a Related Person, McGrath Australasia, in the franchisee's property management business and thus be contrary to cl 13.1. 22 In any event, there is, I think, a real risk of there being an indirect involvement in every case where a franchisee conducts a property management business from the same premises it conducts its McGrath franchise.
