 The Tribunal found that Mr Robertson's major depression 'had its clinical onset in the mid 1990s' and continued: Given this time range and the clinical onset of post traumatic stress disorder in 1994, I find it more probable than not that Mr Robertson had post traumatic stress disorder within one year immediately before the clinical onset of major depression. 18 The Tribunal found that both Mr Robertson's alcohol dependence and major depression were related to his 'eligible service'.
 SUBMISSIONS (a) 'Defence service' not 'eligible service' 19 The Commission submits that the Tribunal erred by finding that Mr Robertson's service was 'eligible service' as referred to in s 9(1)(e) of the Act rather than finding that his service was 'defence service' as defined in s 68(1)(a) of the Act.
 The relevant SoP all applied to 'eligible service' which is defined in clause 8 of each SoP to include 'eligible war service' and 'defence service' with the result that the factors required by the SoP for both forms of service were identical. (c) Effect of intervening stressors 23 The Commission submits that unless the clinical onset of PTSD occurred prior to or during Mr Robertson's defence service, the possibility of the condition becoming clinically worse as a result of the intervening stressors experienced during his defence service does not arise.
