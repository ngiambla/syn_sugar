 The monies which were advanced by the second respondent were secured by a first mortgage and the monies provided by the first respondent are secured by a second mortgage. 4 On 3 May 2007, the first respondent issued a notice of default alleging that the applicant was in default in compliance with the provisions of the mortgage and various facility agreements, in that the applicant had failed to make payments of interest on the due date set out in the facility agreements and to repay all the monies at the end of the accommodation period set out in those agreements.
 Both parties accept that s 12CC had no application to the advance of $3.75 million that was made by the first respondent in July 2006 to permit the applicant to meet its performance bond obligations to the Water Corporation. 13 As previously stated, the applicant engaged in a number of separate dealings with the first respondent whereby he progressively increased the total amount of the monies he borrowed.
 It is the case that on each of the occasions of a further advance, new terms were agreed. 14 The second issue is whether there is a serious question to be tried, that by stipulating that the applicant agree to a risk fee as a condition of the advance, the first respondent engaged in unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 12CC of the Act. 15 The authorities distinguish between the nature and quality of unconscionable conduct prescribed by s 12CA of the Act which relies upon unconscionability under the unwritten law, and conduct characterised as unconscionable under s 12CC of the Act.
 He also deposed that if risk fees were eliminated from the amount claimed and interest was charged at 12.5%, the total amount owing under the second mortgage would be around $8 million, and not $15.5 million as claimed. 22 The applicant also complained that the respondents had refused to give their consent to the settlement of a number of sales of lots comprising the development and this had prevented the applicant from further reducing the amount of the debt. 23 The first respondent contended that the balance of convenience did not favour the grant of an injunction.
