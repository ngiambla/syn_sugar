 The applicant also contended that he lost his job and his family lost its income and could not continue to lead a normal life. 10 The Tribunal then proceeded to consider evidence in relation to those factual contentions and examined the evidence which was given by the appellant before the Tribunal on 14 July 2005.
 The Tribunal then noted: This, in addition to the internal inconsistencies and significant inconsistencies with his evidence before the first Tribunal led this Tribunal to conclude that his evidence is neither truthful nor credible. 16 The Tribunal further concluded that it did not accept that the applicant, as he then was, was detained between May and November 2004 because of the substandard processing practices at the workplace as he had claimed.
