 Mr Dunstan's evidence was that, in late September 2006, he told the shift coordinators that they were responsible for Mr Claveria's actions and that, from this point, he "took a greater interest in monitoring where [Mr Claveria] was, and whether he was at his work station".
 Mr Seneviratne also said that Mr Dunstan had denied that Mr Claveria was sacked for this reason. 69 Mr Vari's evidence was that he attended the 1 February 2007 meeting in order to speak with Pilkington about Mr Claveria's termination and re-instatement.
 In cross-examination, Mr Vari reiterated that Mr Dunstan said that he felt that Mr Claveria had "gone behind his back and made a complaint to the union for harassment". 70 Mr Findlay and Mr Dunstan denied that Mr Vari had made any mention of bullying or harassment.
