 On 14 November 2002 the Minister notified a magistrate under s 16 of Extradition Act that an extradition request had been received. 3 In December 2002 a magistrate committed the applicant to prison to await the surrender for which he was determined eligible pursuant to s 19(9) of the Extradition Act .
 In support of such submission the applicant relies upon Nagaratnam v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 176 ; (1999) 84 FCR 569 at 580 where Lee and Katz JJ referred to Australia's ratification of the Torture Convention and particularly to Australia's obligation under Article 3(1) of the Torture Convention.
 Is the Minister required to act in accordance with the Torture Convention? 25 The applicant claims that the Minister must act in accordance with the objects of the Torture Convention, and that this would prevent the Minister from extraditing the applicant pending the UN Committee's determination of the communication.
 The Minister is bound to follow the provisions of the Extradition Act , which he did, and as such there is no basis upon which the claimed breach of procedural fairness brought about by a legitimate expectation of conformity with the Torture Convention could arise.
