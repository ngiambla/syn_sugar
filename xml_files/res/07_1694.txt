 This is because failure to comply with the terms of a court order may give rise to contempt proceedings in which determination of questions of construction of the terms of the injunction is not appropriate since ambiguity or uncertainty may be a defence in such proceedings: see ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 259 (per Lockhart J); MacLean v Shell Chemical (Australia) Pty Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 593 at 599 (per Toohey J).
 With Brother acknowledging that the order it proposed was not intended to cover parallel importation, Dynamic Supplies submits that the pleadings, the trial, the course of evidence and the Court's decision did not, and should not now in effect, enjoin it from any such parallel importation of genuine goods genuinely packaged. 7 Dynamic Supplies also submits that the Court's decision was based on the limited evidence placed before it, and that as a consequence there is no basis on which it can order the relief sought in Brother's proposed order because the breadth of such relief would, in effect, relate to an entirely different case.
 For the same reasons, it also suggests that the words " have been applied " should precede " without licence or authority ". 8 Contrary to Dynamic Supplies' position, Brother says that the breadth of its proposed order 3 is appropriate when one has regard to the need for the Court to express disapproval of the original breach and deter future breaches, the need to effectively monitor the situation, and the wide powers of the Court under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).
 On the basis of these considerations, and on the fact the Dynamic Supplies now seeks a narrowing of the proposed orders because it does not wish to bear the burden of properly inspecting the goods it imports, Brother invites the inference that there is a real threat that other or further breaches will be committed by Dynamic Supplies unless it is restrained.
