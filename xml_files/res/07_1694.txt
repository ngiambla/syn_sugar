 For the same reasons, it also suggests that the words " have been applied " should precede " without licence or authority ". 8 Contrary to Dynamic Supplies' position, Brother says that the breadth of its proposed order 3 is appropriate when one has regard to the need for the Court to express disapproval of the original breach and deter future breaches, the need to effectively monitor the situation, and the wide powers of the Court under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth).
 On the basis of these considerations, and on the fact the Dynamic Supplies now seeks a narrowing of the proposed orders because it does not wish to bear the burden of properly inspecting the goods it imports, Brother invites the inference that there is a real threat that other or further breaches will be committed by Dynamic Supplies unless it is restrained.
