 The decision that the application is not valid is not merits reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal, as noted in s 338 of the Act . 6 In this case, the decision of the Minister was that the application was not valid because it did not specify the residential address in the form.
 In doing so, you must provide evidence of residing at the stated residential address in any future applications. ' 7 Through the application of reg 2.07 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth), an application for a visa that is made using an approved form is not valid if it does not set out the applicant's residential address in the form or in some second accompanying document.
 Having regard to the limited evidence which is presently before me and the stringent and clear provision of the Act , the law seems to be quite clear that the Department considered the approval form to be invalid, and that such a decision is not reviewable by the Migration Review Tribunal. 9 Accordingly, while I find that the decision of the Federal Magistrate was in error in this matter, I am of the view that it is futile to remit the matter.
