 The applicant stated that he and Mr Lin believed that the investigators into the accident had been bribed. (6) In early March 2005 the applicant stated that he and Mr Lin organised a petition to protest over the accident and the company's inaction.
 The applicant claimed that he escaped into hiding with a friend in Xiamen city. 6 The factual background is elaborated further but these particulars set out the contention in relation to the incident itself and the insurance claim. 7 The Tribunal accepted that the contract provided that the company was responsible for work safety and insurance.
 However, it does not accept that this led to him being a person of interest to the authorities because he was Mr Lin's deputy and that his protests against the company were regarded as anti-government as claimed.
 The Tribunal has given the applicant the benefit of the doubt that his master Mr Lin was arrested in April 2005, although there is no definite evidence apart from the applicant's assertion that it was because he organised the demonstration for compensation.
