 The letter also referred to the receipt by Reefton of the shareholders' notice of general meeting and advised that shareholders should note that the five members who called the meeting did so on their own initiative and without any involvement of the company or the existing directors.
 It does so for the proposition that the persons calling the meeting should be regarded as quasi-officials of the company and subject to the same supervision as directors summonsing a meeting, so that they must act for the benefit of the company as a whole and not for some ulterior purpose.
 It is also relevant that the defendants accept not only that the chair of Reefton may chair their general meeting, but also that, if their meeting proceeds and the new directors take office, they will have no power to cancel the general meeting convened by Reefton for 12 February 2007.
 BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE This is not a case where the shareholders will be excluded from voting in respect of any of the persons who have accepted the invitation to nominate as directors in response to Reefton's letter of 8 December 2006.
