 The applicant did inform the Federal Magistrate that he became aware of the Tribunal's decision when he was located by officers of the Minister's Department in February 2005 and placed in immigration detention. 3 Mr Chami, solicitor, who appears for the Minister, fairly conceded that he was unable to establish that there had been personal delivery of the reasons of the Tribunal.
 However, it seems to me that none of the matters to which reference is made in the Minister's submissions go to the question which was before Scarlett FM as to whether the Federal Magistrates Court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for judicial review. 9 In light of the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC there can be no real argument but that the decision of the Federal Magistrate is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave to appeal.
 Moreover, it seems to me that the practical course is to allow the appeal because the matter cannot be distinguished from the decision of the Full Court in SZKKC . 11 After some debate, Mr Chami accepted the inevitability of this outcome and did not really oppose an order that the appeal be allowed because the effect of this will be that the matter is to be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for hearing of the application for review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 12 In his reasons for judgment Scarlett FM drew attention to the delays in this matter.
