 The Tribunal identified as the key preliminary issue whether it could be satisfied that either the appellant or her husband was or might be perceived by Chinese authorities to be a committed Falun Gong practitioner. 3 The Tribunal found in respect of the appellant that the vagueness of her evidence cast doubt on the plausibility of her claim to have done Falun Gong exercises in China between 1995 and 1999.
 I note that the independent country information, such as it was, supported a finding by the Tribunal that was favourable to the appellant that Falun Gong practitioners face harassment or more serious harm in China.
 Unless there was an error in respect of a jurisdictional fact, which was not the case, the Federal Magistrates C ourt had no power to substitute its own view of the facts for those of the Tribunal.
