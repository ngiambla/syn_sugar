 It was said by Mr Theo that Mr McCabe failed to express an opinion on the validity of the mentioned relevant laws which do not contain any restrictions similar to those which disbarred him on the basis of his age for the Disability Support Pension for which he applied on 23 May 2006. 9 The legal position is, quite simply, that there is no such contract to be derived from that legislation which frees Mr Theo from the age restrictions which apply to the grant of a Disability Support Pension.
 The legal position is quite plain, and Mr Theo does not have an entitlement to a Disability Support Pension. 10 I know that there are long-standing complaints by Mr Theo about events which occurred more than 10 years ago, when it appears Mr Theo was in receipt of a Disability Support Pension and that was altered unilaterally, he says, to an Age Pension.
 Regardless of the history of that particular matter, it cannot be argued that there is a legal error demonstrated in the judgment of the Tribunal with respect to the refusal of the application lodged for a Disability Support Pension by Mr Theo on 23 May 2006 when Mr Theo was 72 years of age. 11 In those circumstances, it is in the interests of everybody, including Mr Theo, that his appeal be dismissed. 12 The notice of motion seeks costs.
 I will hear the parties on that, but there seems to be no reason why the ordinary rule as to costs should not apply. 13 Finally, I should note that in respect of the three social security payments which were mentioned by Mr Theo in the course of discussions this morning, namely, the Newstart Allowance, Disability Support Pension and the Age Pension; he is not eligible for either a Newstart or a Disability Support Pension by virtue of his age. 14 Mr Theo is an undischarged bankrupt and he asserts that he has no means.
