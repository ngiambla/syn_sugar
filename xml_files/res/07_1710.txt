 On the facts as found by the Tribunal, the Respondent earned, derived or received for her own use or benefit the sums subsequently repaid by her to the Hotel in respect of TAB till shortfalls within the meaning of s 8(1) and (2) of the Act irrespective of any contractual obligation to make good any TAB till shortfalls. 4.
 Question: on the facts as found by the AAT, does the respondent's ordinary income include the sums subsequently repaid by her to the Hotel in respect of TAB till shortfalls within the meaning of s 8(1) and s 1072 of the Act ? 28 This question was clearly viewed by the SSAT and the AAT as the key issue in this case.
 Indeed in considering whether the respondent's ordinary income included these sums, the question may be recharacterised as whether the sums subsequently repaid by the respondent to the Hotel in respect of TAB till shortfalls constituted income amounts earned, derived or received by the respondent for her own use or benefit.
