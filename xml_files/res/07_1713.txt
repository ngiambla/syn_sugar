 The Tribunal stated that, as I had put to the Applicant in the course of the hearing, the fact that there was no mention of his claimed conversion to the Shia faith, his membership of the JYP or his claimed kidnapping in his original application or in the statement accompanying his original application might lead me to conclude that he had fabricated these claims on the basis of the documents which he had received from Pakistan.
 The Tribunal stated that I might conclude that there was no truth in his claims that he had converted from the Sunni faith to the Shia faith, that he was a member of an organisation called the JYP or that he had been kidnapped by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in 2005 because he was a member of the JYP.
 As I put to the Applicant in the course of the hearing and again in the section 424A letter, I consider that the Applicant has fabricated his claims with regard to his conversion to the Shia faith, his membership of the JYP and the kidnapping on the basis of the documents he has received from Pakistan.
 I accept that the Applicant's mother died around two months before the date of the hearing before me (as the Applicant mentioned in the course of the hearing) but not that her death had anything to do with the Applicant's claimed conversion, his membership of the JYP or his connection with an organisation of eunuchs.
