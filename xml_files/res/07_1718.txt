 1 By a notice of motion filed on 27 June 2007 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) sought the extension of orders previously made under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) against the various defendants.
 ASIC seeks to extend orders against the second defendant substantially in terms of an order proposed by Mr Rundle and exhibited to the affidavit of Martina Ana Sedic sworn 29 August 2007.
 Submissions in support of the proposed orders were filed by ASIC on 4 October 2007 and by Mr Rundle on 26 October 2007. 2 ASIC accepts that it is necessary that the Court be satisfied that the proposed orders are within power and appropriate.
 The consideration for that transfer and a further $199,735 was expended in acquiring redeemable preference shares in a newly incorporated company, which shares were shortly thereafter assessed by Mr Rundle as having a negligible value.
