 The second Tribunal said that it had considered carefully the reasons given by the appellant and her sister for the failure to include some or all of those claims.
 She dealt with the second Tribunal's reasoning on the appellant's response to the s 424A letter and the suggestion that the Tribunal had prejudged the issue of her credibility.
 It considered her claimed fear in the context of "her situation as a young woman without immediate family support and protection and a perception that she is at risk generally from members of the indigenous Fijian community".
