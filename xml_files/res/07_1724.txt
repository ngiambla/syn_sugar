 On 20 September 2007, the Federal Court gave notice to the appellant of the time, date and place for a hearing of the appeal by sending that letter to the appellant's nominated address in his affidavit filed in support of the notice of appeal, namely, 1/6 Forth Avenue, Campsie, NSW, 2194.
 The Appeal Book was also served upon the appellant at that address (24 October 2007) and the first respondent sent its submissions to the appellant at the same address (6 November 2007). 2 The first respondent has moved for an order pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) for an order that the appeal be dismissed by reason of the failure of the appellant to attend a hearing relating to the appeal.
 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa. 4 By a notice of appeal filed on 27 July 2007, the appellant contends that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision by the Tribunal, and the particulars of that ground are five-fold.
 That contention is not supported by any particulars or any material and having regard to the observations of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at 531, and particularly [72], the threshold for establishing either actual or apprehended bias is not made out. 11 Accordingly, having regard to the merits of the matter, there is no ground of appeal made out by the appellant on these papers.
