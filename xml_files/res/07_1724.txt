 On 20 September 2007, the Federal Court gave notice to the appellant of the time, date and place for a hearing of the appeal by sending that letter to the appellant's nominated address in his affidavit filed in support of the notice of appeal, namely, 1/6 Forth Avenue, Campsie, NSW, 2194.
 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa. 4 By a notice of appeal filed on 27 July 2007, the appellant contends that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the decision by the Tribunal, and the particulars of that ground are five-fold.
