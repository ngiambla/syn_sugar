 While it is possible that the applicant's parents will have suffered during the Cultural Revolution, and the applicant may have had poor education in that period, there is no indication that the applicant faces or faced any form of persecution in recent times because of the events of the Cultural Revolution.
 The Tribunal notes that the applicant does not make any specific claims in relation to persecution because of the Cultural Revolution and problems suffered by his parents during the revolution. (2) He also claims that he was arrested after 1999 and detained for 10 days because of his association with Falun Gong.
 I can find no error in her Honour's consideration of the Tribunal's assessment of those matters or the tests applied by the Tribunal. 25 The second matter considered by her Honour related to whether the Tribunal had discharged obligations cast upon it by s 424A(1) of the Migration Act and in that respect, her Honour concluded that there was no inconsistency in any claim made in the applicant's statements in support of his protection visa application; that the applicant had repeated the claims in his written statement in support of a visa application, before the Tribunal; and that the Tribunal had regard to the applicant's claim of arrest in 1989 and the matters concerning the Falun Gong associated detention in 1999. 26 Her Honour concluded at [31]: The Applicant provided the information to which the Tribunal had regard in making those findings to the Tribunal for the purposes of his review.
