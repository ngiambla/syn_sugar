 Clause 2.1 also provided for the appointment to be subject to Ernst Young's Terms and Conditions of Business as set out in Schedule 4 to the Deed to the extent that they were not directly in contradiction with the other terms and conditions of the Deed. 76 The applicant submits that, in the absence of the 'Deed of Appointment of Replacement Probity Auditor dated 27 March 2006', the use of the words 'as amended' inclines one to the view that the second respondent did not simply agree to be bound by the terms of the 1 October 2002 Deed as if named in it as the original Probity Auditor, thus providing reasonable cause to believe that the second respondent lacked authority to act as a replacement Probity Auditor under the Deed made 1 October 2002. 77 Another Transaction Document which Australian Titanium Products Pty Limited was required to give to the first respondent at completion of the Share Purchase Agreement was Westpac Banking Corporation's 'Banker's Undertaking' in the form of annexure C to that agreement.
 The Banker's Undertaking relevantly provided: ' Banker's Undertaking By: Westpac Banking Corporation ABN 33 007 457 141 To: Echo Tasmania Pty Limited In consideration of Echo Tasmania Pty Limited (the Favouree ) accepting this undertaking and subject to satisfaction of the conditions below, Westpac Banking Corporation ( Westpac ) undertakes to pay any sum or sums which may from time to time be demanded by the Favouree up to a maximum aggregate sum of $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million dollars) Australian Currency (the Sum ).
 In accordance with Clause 3.5 of the Deed, the Probity Auditor is of the opinion that the processes adopted by Echo and referred to in clause 3.4(f) have been carried out in a fair and equitable manner and conducted with due probity in respect of the following Payment Event: (a) [insert description of Payment Event] (b) [insert amount of Payment Request] Signed sealed and delivered ) by ERNST YOUNG ) in the presence of: ) Notary Public Partner Name (please print) ...' 78 It may be seen that Westpac's agreement to pay monies under its Banker's Undertaking was dependent upon its receipt of a certificate which in the Bank's reasonable opinion was substantially in the form of Schedule 1.
