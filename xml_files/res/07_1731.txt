 Clause 2.1 also provided for the appointment to be subject to Ernst Young's Terms and Conditions of Business as set out in Schedule 4 to the Deed to the extent that they were not directly in contradiction with the other terms and conditions of the Deed. 76 The applicant submits that, in the absence of the 'Deed of Appointment of Replacement Probity Auditor dated 27 March 2006', the use of the words 'as amended' inclines one to the view that the second respondent did not simply agree to be bound by the terms of the 1 October 2002 Deed as if named in it as the original Probity Auditor, thus providing reasonable cause to believe that the second respondent lacked authority to act as a replacement Probity Auditor under the Deed made 1 October 2002. 77 Another Transaction Document which Australian Titanium Products Pty Limited was required to give to the first respondent at completion of the Share Purchase Agreement was Westpac Banking Corporation's 'Banker's Undertaking' in the form of annexure C to that agreement.
