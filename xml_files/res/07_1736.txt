 By cl 9.3 MES assumed liability for all employee entitlements including any entitlements for notice or redundancy on termination. 4 In anticipation of the sale agreement being executed, on 12 November 2004 MES wrote to employees at the workshop and offered them employment with MES.
 The employees were told by the representatives of Skilled and MES that all employee entitlements, including redundancy entitlements, would be carried over to the new company if the employees accepted employment with MES.
 The other view is that it should be treated as having validly terminated the employees' employment because both MES and the employees acted upon the letter treating the notice as being effective.
