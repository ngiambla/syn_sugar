 She noted that the Tribunal had examined those of the brother's diaries that were provided to it and found that they contained no sensitive information about the LTTE, or about corruption amongst officers in the Sri Lankan army.

 The learned Federal Magistrate failed to take into consideration that the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was rendered invalid by a jurisdictional error made by the Tribunal by and/or identified a wrong issue, asked a wrong question, relied on irrelevant material or ignored relevant material.
