 I note that a previously constituted Tribunal in a decision dated 6 February 2006 had earlier affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister refusing to grant a protection visa to the appellant, but that the Federal Court in a decision of 4 October 2006 allowed an appeal against that decision and remitted the matter to the Tribunal for reconsideration.
 The Tribunal was affected by jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal did not take into account certain relevant considerations or "integers" central to the appellant's claim. 9. 10. 22 A number of these grounds were not raised before Driver FM.
