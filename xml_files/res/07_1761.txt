 The applicant provided the respondent and the Court with a list setting out with some particularity the documents for which legal professional privilege was claimed. 3 On the last occasion that the Court sat, the respondent sought production of a number of those documents on the ground that the applicant had a duty, akin to a prosecutorial duty in the criminal law, to provide the respondent with the documents for which legal professional privilege was claimed.
 The respondent at that time accepted that the documents would be privileged and free from production, except for, as the respondent put it, that the applicant owed a prosecutorial duty to the respondent. 4 At that time I advised Mr Ats, who appeared for the respondent, that there was authority against the proposition which he advanced.
 The principles of prosecutorial fairness do not apply in civil penalty proceedings: Adler v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 179 FLR 1 at [678] per Giles J (Mason P and Beazley JA agreeing); Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Rich (2005) 53 ACSR 320 at [358].
