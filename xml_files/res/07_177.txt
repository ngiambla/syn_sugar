 His Honour pointed out that, on 10 March 2003 when the matter was fixed for hearing, the applicant was personally present in Court. 5 When the applicant did not appear for the hearing on 30 April 2003, his Honour did not simply dismiss the application by reason of his absence, rather he proceeded to hear the matter and to deal with the matter substantively pursuant to O 32 r 2.
 In those circumstances I have no hesitation to make orders dismissing the application and I do so order. 7 In his affidavit of 11 January 2007 supporting today's motion, the applicant gives the following explanation in [6] for his failure to attend before Allsop J: In my previous matter the legal representation I had stopped me from attending court and this also therefore prevented me from effectively presenting my matter. 8 The applicant's affidavit asserts in somewhat vague terms that there was jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.
 In this regard, I take into account matters which appear on the Court file and were discussed with the parties this morning. 15 It is plain that the applicant had access to legal advice in March 2003 before the matter was heard by Allsop J and it is also plain that he has not made any attempt to seek relief from the Court other than on the present application filed in January 2007.
