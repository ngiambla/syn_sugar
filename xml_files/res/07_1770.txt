 Both the applicant's claims and country information regarding blood feuds makes it clear that the reason the applicant's uncle was being pursued, and in turn the family of the applicant's uncle, is because of the perceived offence, not the applicant's uncle's political religious views, his ethnicity nor nationality.
 I make this finding because it is my opinion that this blood feud, which the applicant fears may result in harm to himself, is motivated for a non-Convention reason, that being the perceived offences committed by the applicant's uncle. ...
 As most recently advanced the appellant's contentions did not rest entirely on fear of revenge for his uncle's behaviour but included the proposition that the appellant would be persecuted nevertheless because he was a member of a distinct social group.
