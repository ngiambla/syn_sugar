 The remaining associates, Dr Ranu's company and Dr Crowe's company, continued to fix fees in the way already described. 16 On 14 June 2005 Dr Ranu's company and Dr Crowe's company entered into an agreement (the Practice Agreement) to make certain arrangements for their practices to share premises, equipment and overheads. 17 By an agreement made on 1 July 2005 Dr Stankevicius' company became a party to the Practice Agreement.
 They took over the goodwill of a practice formerly carried on by Dr Philip Rogers. 25 Dr Gupta's company was also a party to this arrangement from about July 1998 until about March 2003. 26 Upon his withdrawal from the arrangement Dr Gupta's company agreed in writing with Dr Ranu's company and Dr Crowe's company that the latter companies would have their primary practice in "the Northern Division of Tasmania" and Dr Gupta's company would have its primary practice in "the Southern Division of Tasmania".
