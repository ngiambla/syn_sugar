 Given the inconsistency in the applicant's evidence as to who came and threatened him not to give evidence in support of Jafarullah, the Tribunal does not accept he was warned by either the police or the RSS as he claimed.
 As the Tribunal does not accept the applicant was warned by the RSS not to give evidence in support of Jafaraullah, it does not accept the RSS burnt down the applicant's house with him and his family in it. ...
