 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 834 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 46, Barrett J adopted the description and explanation of a 'managed investment scheme and its components' in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Knightsbridge Managed Funds Ltd [2001] WASC 339 at [45] - [49] and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at [26]-[32].
 In view of the fact that they have not commenced trading and that there is no evidence they hold any assets or have been in the receipt of moneys in any way associated with the Scheme, I do not propose to make any orders in relation to these companies. 43 AHL and AF have been trading, but apparently have no bank account and have not prepared tax or financial returns for the year ending 30 June 2007.
 Given that AHL and AF are trading, and in light of my views which I am about to express as to the state of their financial records, I do propose to continue the restraining orders against AF and impose such orders on AHL. 44 In relation to MK River, it has been trading and Mr Andrew Leonard Dunner was appointed Receiver and Manager on 23 March 2007.
