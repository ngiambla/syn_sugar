 The first is to set aside the orders dismissing the proceedings on 17 August 2007 if the security for costs orders made on 14 February 2007 were not met by that date, and the consequential costs orders (Orders 1 and 4 made on 17 May 2007).
 There was in addition, of course, the evidence then to be adduced by the respondents. 6 The respondents' application for further security for costs was deferred from time to time during the first week of the hearing whilst the applicant's principal witness gave evidence.
 No appeal was brought from the security for costs orders (Orders 3 and 4 made on 14 February 2007) within the time permitted by O 52 r 15 of the Federal Court Rules 1976 (Cth). 8 The further security for costs as ordered was not paid.
