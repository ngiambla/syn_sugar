 The Tribunal rejected the submission that the appellant had been denied procedural fairness in relation to the document because the appellant was given a clear opportunity to respond to the country information of which the member advised the appellant to the effect that such documents were easily obtainable in Bangladesh.
 Moreover, in this case, contrary to the facts in WACO [2003] FCAFC 171 ; 131 FCR 511, the Tribunal raised its concerns with the appellant about the status of the document during the hearing. 41 It was put that the second and third grounds of appeal were not raised before the Federal Magistrate.
 In my opinion, the proper inference to be drawn from the exchange which took place between the appellant and the member was that the original either was available or could be made available if the Tribunal required the document.
