 The application before the Federal Magistrate sought judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) made on 30 March 2007 and handed down on 24 April 2007. 2 The applicant filed an application in this Court for an extension of time on 30 August 2007.
 As can be seen, that section, of course, only relates to an appeal and not to an application for leave to appeal or to an application for an extension of time for leave to appeal.
 Order 52 rule 38A(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) (the Rules) provides that if a person is absent when an appeal is called on for hearing the Court may order that the hearing not proceed, adjourn the hearing, or proceed with the hearing either generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the appeal. 8 Order 52 rule 38A(2) provides that a party who has not appeared and has suffered an order under O 52 r 38A(1) may apply to the Court to set aside or vary any order made under O 52 r 38A(1).
 Again, however, O 52 r 38A does not empower the Court to make any order in relation to an application for leave to appeal or an application for an extension of time for leave to appeal.
