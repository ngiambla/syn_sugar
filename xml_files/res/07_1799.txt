 Mr Di Stefano is also the registered proprietor of Registered Design No. 131 578 for a 'Spring Clutch'. 4 SBriggs cross-claims in that action for relief for patent infringement by Uniline and has joined Mr Di Stefano who undertakes to abide by any order of the Court and who seeks, uncontroversially, to be excused from further participation in the proceeding.
 Uniline denies infringement of the patent and, in turn, cross-claims for a declaration of invalidity of the relevant claims of the patent and revocation of the patent on grounds of lack of novelty, lack of inventive step (and thus a determination of whether the invention claimed is obvious), lack of clarity (that is, a failure to comply with s 40(3) of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth)) and a contention that the relevant claims are not 'fairly based' on matters described in the specification (s 40(3)).
 Uniline denies embodiment of the applicant's design in its Uniline Spring Clutch assembly. 7 Uniline makes no claim for the previously foreshadowed revocation of the Registered Design. 8 Each action is to be heard together. 9 As to the design infringement proceedings, Uniline concedes that it ought to give discovery of: 1.
 Uniline in the cross proceedings denies infringement and says the patent (or at least the relevant claims of the patent) is invalid on the four identified grounds which is, no doubt, why Uniline says the 'threats' are unjustifiable. 17 Uniline seeks from SBriggs all documents relating to the two letters and two oral threats (categories 1, 2, 3 and 4).
