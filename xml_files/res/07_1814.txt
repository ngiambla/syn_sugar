 He did not, therefore, make any attempt to suggest that, in fact, he laboured under any misunderstanding of Gray J's order when engaging in the impugned conduct. 11 Despite numerous opportunities to do so Mr Siminton has failed to provide evidence of his personal and financial circumstances.
 The Court held that a dispensation might be given, inter alia, where the contemnor had been in Court at the time at which the orders were pronounced or where there was evidence that the contemnor had knowledge of the need to obey the order: see at 147. 19 Mr Siminton was present in Court on 10 January 2006 when Gray J made his orders.
