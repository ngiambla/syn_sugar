 He used the card for these purposes. 3 Charges 1.1 to 1.5 related to transfers into the Holzheimer's account from a Mobile EFT Pty Ltd account controlled by Mr Siminton. 4 Charge 1.7 related to the use, by Mr Siminton, of moneys transferred into the Holzheimer's account.
 The transfer occurred on 16 August 2006. 6 Charge 1.11 was concerned with a series of transactions, undertaken by Mr Siminton between 16 August 2006 and 28 September 2006, in which he either withdrew money or undertook credit transactions totalling $21,377.93 from the funds which he had caused to be deposited into the Holzheimer's account. 7 On 30 March 2006 Mr Siminton had been found guilty of various contempts.
 He did not, therefore, make any attempt to suggest that, in fact, he laboured under any misunderstanding of Gray J's order when engaging in the impugned conduct. 11 Despite numerous opportunities to do so Mr Siminton has failed to provide evidence of his personal and financial circumstances.
 The Court held that a dispensation might be given, inter alia, where the contemnor had been in Court at the time at which the orders were pronounced or where there was evidence that the contemnor had knowledge of the need to obey the order: see at 147. 19 Mr Siminton was present in Court on 10 January 2006 when Gray J made his orders.
