 It therefore concluded that he did not have an objectively based well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of an imputed political opinion or a political opinion. 26 The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.
 The application did not contain any detail. 27 In his written submissions before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant's counsel submitted that the Tribunal failed to properly exercise its jurisdiction under s 91R of the Act by not properly considering the risk of serious harm if the appellant were compelled to return to Bahrain.
 The Tribunal specifically addressed that question and found, as a matter of fact, that the appellant's low political profile would be such that no political opinion would be imputed to him by the authorities. 53 However, for the reasons given, the appeal must be allowed.
