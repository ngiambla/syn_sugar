 CSM also negotiated with Crown Casino for Spriggs to make public appearances at the opening of a pub and the give away of a car at the casino. 30 During the 2004 and 2005 income years, CSM was unsuccessful in securing "endorsements, merchandising, appearances and media contracts" for Spriggs.
 Three points should be made about the second limb: it operates and only operates to allow deductions of business expenses; the business must be carried on for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income and, as with the first limb, "assessable income" refers to assessable income generally and not the assessable income of a particular income year.
 Issue 1: was the management fee incurred by Spriggs in gaining or producing his assessable income in the 2005 income year under s 8-1(a) of the 1997 Act ? 43 There is no dispute that the management fee was both an "outgoing" and was "incurred".
 In dollar terms, the management fee of $2,100 is equivalent to 3% of Spriggs' base payment for the 2005 year under the 2005 / 2006 Contract and that was the compensation CSM was entitled to receive under cl 3 of the Representation Agreement for successfully negotiating an AFL Standard Playing Contract or contracts acceptable to Spriggs.
 The marketing and media activities undertaken by Spriggs in the 2005 income year were limited to the use of his image on AFL Select Player Cards for which he derived licensing fees of $641. 46 Spriggs submitted that the management fee was, as the invoice stated, for " management and promotional services by CSM for season 2004 " and that those services were not identified.
 Issue 2: was the management fee incurred by Spriggs in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing his assessable income in the 2005 income year under s 8-1(b) of the 1997 Act ? 48 The Commissioner did not contend that it was not possible for a professional sportsperson to be carrying on a business of exploiting his or her sporting talent.
 He turned his football talent to account for money both before and during the 2005 income year: see [27] --- [31] above. 49 In fact, the Commissioner did not dispute that CSM sought to negotiate "Additional Services" to be undertaken by Spriggs during the 2005 income year.
 As the High Court said in Stone (at 305), the fact that other sports and other athletes may have attracted larger rewards is irrelevant. 53 In the 2005 income year, Spriggs was carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing his assessable income.
 In this case, the Commissioner contends that the management fee was incurred at a point too soon to be an expense incurred in gaining or producing assessable income notwithstanding that: (1) the management fee was incurred on 20 December 2004; and (2) the playing contract for the 2005 season was signed on 9 December 2004. 55 The Commissioner's general (not to say universal) contention that all expenditure incurred prior to the playing contract being signed was not deductible because it came "at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income" should be rejected.
 That framework has to be considered in context including Mr Shinners' evidence that it is rare for a player to negotiate his own playing contract and that he estimates 90% of AFL players currently have an accredited agent. 58 Moreover, the management fee was not incurred prior to the generation of the income.
