 1 The Court heard evidence from Mr Brownie Doolan under s 46 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the FCA Act) and O 24 r 1(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules in November 2004, so as to preserve it for the hearing of this application for the determination of native title under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).
 As to the objection that the proposed Order 11 was not necessary, the applicants submitted that without such an Order the Order made on 9 November 2004 might have the unintended consequence of inhibiting the giving of "preservation evidence". 7 "Preservation evidence" under s 46 of the FCA Act does not automatically become evidence in the hearing of the proceeding: s 46(d).
 In deciding whether to rely on his evidence, the applicants and their advisers may take into account a variety of matters, including whether it is desirable to reveal the male gender restricted evidence to the particular judge conducting the hearing. 12 The respondent parties may also apply to rely on Mr Doolan's evidence, or parts of it, at the hearing, in the event that the applicants do not do so.
 His decision about what preservation evidence he might have given has already been made, and could not therefore have been influenced by the proposed Order 11. 15 Almost invariably (although not necessarily) preservation evidence in a claim under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) will be given by an indigenous person whose evidence is sought to be preserved to be available to the applicants if the claim proceeds to hearing.
