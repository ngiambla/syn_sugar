 He approached Mr Hodge because he had heard that Mr Hodge may be interested in selling a part of his financial planning business. 44 Mr Howland and Mr Hodge had a preliminary meeting on 30 April 2004 to discuss the possible sale.
 The plan was sufficiently definite that on 2 December 2004 he sent an email to one of HBN's large clients describing Paragem as "the dealer we will be changing to. " 65 On 7 January 2005 Mr Hodge sent a memorandum to Mr Nicol with a copy to Mr Knox.
 The memorandum stated that Mr Hodge was proceeding on the assumption that "I will be advising my clients and resigning during the last week of January. " This was a reference to his intended resignation from his authorised representative status for GPL.
