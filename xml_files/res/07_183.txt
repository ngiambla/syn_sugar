 The appellant's claim was rejected by a delegate of the Minister and, on review of the delegate's decision, by the Refugee Review Tribunal. 2 On the hearing of the appellant's application to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal, the appellant relied solely on a contention that the Tribunal had failed fully to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 The appellant does not challenge the appropriateness in the circumstances of the refusal of the adjournment application. 13 It was also open to the appellant to make an application to this Court to receive on his appeal evidence additional to that adduced in the Federal Magistrates Court (see O 52 r 36 of the Federal Court Rules ).
 No such application was made. 14 The case sought to be made by the appellant before the Federal Magistrates Court and on appeal was that, even in the absence of evidence of what information the appellant provided to the Tribunal during his hearing, the Federal Magistrate ought to have been satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the information on which the Tribunal based the finding identified in [6] above was not information provided by the appellant during that hearing.
 The reasons for decision of the Tribunal thus tend to establish that the appellant gave to the Tribunal the information that Mr Haque was his adviser both as at the date of the Tribunal hearing and in May 2005 (ie the date of his visa application). 16 The finding of the Tribunal that Mr Haque had been available to give the appellant advice throughout the period between May 2005 and the date of the Tribunal hearing may reflect an inference drawn solely from the information identified in the previous paragraph.
