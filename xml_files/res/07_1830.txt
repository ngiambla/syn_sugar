 The order was made in anticipation of the provision by Miller Street of a bank guarantee in favour of the liquidator to cover the liquidator's costs and expenses to that date and to meet any liabilities of Taycorp.
 A further letter from the solicitor dated 21 October 2005 stated that the bank guarantee should include allowance for further anticipated legal fees and that in any event approximately $224,000 will have been paid to Miller Street by the time the guarantee is delivered and title to the properties is transferred.
 The payments were made to enable Miller Street to meet its obligations. 19 On these facts Miller Street claims that the liquidator's delay caused the discretionary trust to suffer two heads of loss.
 Some information was given on 8 March 2005 when Mr Tayles forwarded to the liquidator a statement of affairs and a pro forma balance sheet for the discretionary trust.
