 In substance, Symbion Health has agreed to sell, and Healthscope has agreed to buy, Symbion Health's "Diagnostics Businesses" in consideration for the issue by Healthscope to Symbion Health of shares in Healthscope which are to be distributed to the Symbion Health shareholders in implementation of a reduction of the capital of Symbion Health. 5 By its amended originating process, Idameneo seeks declaratory and injunctive relief based on two aspects of the TID.
 Accordingly, the Diagnostics Transaction may be implemented without the C P Scheme being implemented, or both may be implemented, or neither may be implemented. 15 Another condition precedent to the implementation of the C P Scheme is the passing of a resolution by Symbion Health shareholders that Symbion Health grant financial assistance in connection with the purchase of its shares by the nominee of the IAC Consortium.
 As outlined above at [4] and [12], by the TID, Symbion Health has agreed to sell, and Healthscope has agreed to buy, Symbion Health's Diagnostics Businesses in consideration of the issue of Healthscope shares to Symbion Health which Symbion Health undertakes to distribute to its shareholders by way of the Capital Reduction. 18 The TID provides for a "Symbion Health Break Fee" and a "Healthscope Break Fee".
 A declaration that Symbion Health is not bound by the provision for payment of the Symbion Health Break Fee and an injunction directed against payment of it directly affect Symbion Health's contractual obligations of Symbion Health to Healthscope and Healthscope's contractual rights against Symbion Health. 70 It is not practicable to formulate the relief sought in respect of the Symbion Health Break Fee so that it will affect only the rights and interests of the parties to the proceeding and not those of Healthscope.
