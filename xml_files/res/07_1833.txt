 The Tribunal has had regard to the evidence relating to the considerations for a spousal relationship set out in regulation 1.15A and is not satisfied that the visa applicant was or remains in a genuine spousal relationship with the sponsor at the time of application or the time of decision.
 It follows that as the visa applicant does not meet essential criteria for a Class UK visa, the visa applicant does not meet the criteria for a Class BS visa. 26 The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for the judicial review of the Tribunal's decision.
 Insofar as the Tribunal concluded that there was no genuine spousal relationship, that was a conclusion of fact which is not subject to review by the Federal Magistrates Court or by this Court on appeal. 38 It is suggested that the Federal Magistrate should have issued subpoenas or made some other enquiries.
