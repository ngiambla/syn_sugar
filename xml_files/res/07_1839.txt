 BUCHANAN J: 1 This is an application which seeks on three alternative grounds to set aside a sequestration order made against the estate of the applicant, Mohammad Sharif Amin, by Registrar Tesoriero of this Court on 12 October 2007.
 I infer that the application is not opposed by the trustee. 7 I confess I have little sympathy for the position in which Mr Amin finds himself, which appears to me to be due entirely to his own inattention to his obligations.
 That, in essence, is that the outstanding debt has been paid, there is no opposition to the bankruptcy being brought to an end in an appropriate manner, and on his unchallenged evidence before the court he is in a position to pay his debts as and when they fall due and is, and was on 12 October 2007, solvent. 8 I do not think it would be appropriate to annul the bankruptcy under section 153B of the Bankruptcy Act .
