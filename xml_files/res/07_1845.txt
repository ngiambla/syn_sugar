 I find the representation as pleaded established. 10(b) and 11(d) --- The Dare Warranty Representation 13 The suggested representation is that the warranty on the Dare Montreaux sofa was twice as valuable a warranty as that available on the King Phoenix sofa.
 The respondents relied, in relation to this issue, on Mr Sheppard's evidence and evidence from Mr Ian Hemburrow, the Managing Director of Oakgrove Furniture Pty Limited which manufactures the Montreaux sofas and other furniture for Dare Gallery.
 Although both sofas demonstrate straight and accurate stitching and seams, it is my opinion that in upholstered furniture top stitching produces a product of higher quality, durability and finish than that of single stitching. ... 9(a) The King Phoenix sofa is constructed from a welded-steel frame, compared with the stapled/screwed-timber frame of the Dare Montreaux sofa.
 Upon this closer inspection it is my opinion that the construction and engineering (the "build quality") of both the King Phoenix and Dare Montreaux sofas are of satisfactory quality and durability for their intended use.
