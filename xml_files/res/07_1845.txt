 I find the representation as pleaded established. 10(b) and 11(d) --- The Dare Warranty Representation 13 The suggested representation is that the warranty on the Dare Montreaux sofa was twice as valuable a warranty as that available on the King Phoenix sofa.
 The respondents relied, in relation to this issue, on Mr Sheppard's evidence and evidence from Mr Ian Hemburrow, the Managing Director of Oakgrove Furniture Pty Limited which manufactures the Montreaux sofas and other furniture for Dare Gallery.
 Upon this closer inspection it is my opinion that the construction and engineering (the "build quality") of both the King Phoenix and Dare Montreaux sofas are of satisfactory quality and durability for their intended use.
