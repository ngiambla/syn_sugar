 By clause 6 of the Agreement the State recognised that the Githabul People hold native title in accordance with the consent orders that the Court is invited to make today and agreed to join with the registered native title claimant in applying for those consent orders to be made by the Court.
 Turning first to the legal representatives of the applicant, I would particularly like to thank Mr McAvoy of counsel, Mr Behrendt from Chalk and Fitzgerald and the staff of NTSCORP Limited including Mr Rind and Mr Chapman (who are no longer with NTSCORP Ltd) and Ms Rotumah.
