 By clause 6 of the Agreement the State recognised that the Githabul People hold native title in accordance with the consent orders that the Court is invited to make today and agreed to join with the registered native title claimant in applying for those consent orders to be made by the Court.
 I therefore conclude that the Court is authorised to make the consent determination under s 87 of the Act. 6 The final matter to which s 87(1) requires me to consider is whether it appears to be appropriate to make the consent determination.
 Turning first to the legal representatives of the applicant, I would particularly like to thank Mr McAvoy of counsel, Mr Behrendt from Chalk and Fitzgerald and the staff of NTSCORP Limited including Mr Rind and Mr Chapman (who are no longer with NTSCORP Ltd) and Ms Rotumah.
 For the State of New South Wales I would particularly like to thank Mr Hughston SC with Mr Waters of counsel and Ms Illiadis from the NSW Crown Solicitors Office and Ms Jude and Ms Khan (who has since left the Department of Lands) for their assistance throughout the proceeding and for their persistence in moving the matter forward towards an agreed outcome.
