 It was common ground before his Honour that the substantive application to challenge the visa application could not be dealt with in the Court because there was no decision by the Tribunal in respect of that matter (at [2]). 12 His Honour considered that the decision of the Tribunal officer was a privative clause decision pursuant to s 474(2) Migration Act 1958 (Cth). 13 The grounds for review raised before Jarrett FM were as follows: 1.
 Appeal to this Court 16 There are two grounds of appeal before the Court. 17 First, in her notice of appeal filed 29 August 2006 in this Court, the appellant claimed that "the Federal Magistrate failed to find a jurisdictional error when the initial decision by the Tribunal was made with jurisdictional error".
 Given that in my view the Tribunal has taken into account relevant considerations in reaching its decision, and has made its decision based on findings supported by probative material, I am not persuaded that his Honour was incorrect. 31 Finally, I note again that it is for the appellant to make her case for waiver of the prescribed fee.
