 Appeal to this Court 16 There are two grounds of appeal before the Court. 17 First, in her notice of appeal filed 29 August 2006 in this Court, the appellant claimed that "the Federal Magistrate failed to find a jurisdictional error when the initial decision by the Tribunal was made with jurisdictional error".
 Given that in my view the Tribunal has taken into account relevant considerations in reaching its decision, and has made its decision based on findings supported by probative material, I am not persuaded that his Honour was incorrect. 31 Finally, I note again that it is for the appellant to make her case for waiver of the prescribed fee.
