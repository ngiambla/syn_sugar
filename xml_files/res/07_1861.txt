 Mr Casson considered that it was ' entirely sustainable to have a policy in place in advance of a significant event, that may have an impact on staffing of the agency, and for certainty, and for fairness and equity purposes'.
 Mr Casson believed that the NDCP would have a significant effect on business and considered that it was fair and equitable that if more leave applications were received than could be accommodated, it would be unfair to grant leave to some persons and not to others.
 The onus of the OEA to show that such alteration of position was not for a prohibited reason has been discharged and there is no need for the Court to determine whether there was a threat to do an act in contravention of s 792(1) of the Act.
