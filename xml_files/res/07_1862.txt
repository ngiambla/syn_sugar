 INTRODUCTION 1 This matter was argued in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') on the question of the retrospective operation of s 8(9B) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) ('the SRC Act').
 The Tribunal decision in favour of Mr Perry was that s 8(9B) did not have retrospective operation and was therefore not applicable to an employee injured prior to the commencement of the Amending Act ('the retrospectivity issue').
 Mr Perry also submits that his approach before the Tribunal was not unreasonable, given the history of the matter and the basis of the decisions taken by the delegates of the Commission.
