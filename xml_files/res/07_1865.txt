 As can be seen it requires the parties to whom the subpoena is addressed to produce all documents evidencing any communication of any kind between the party to whom the subpoena is directed and the Australian Building and Construction Commission or the Building Industry Task Force either in relation to the building site at Halifax Street or Mr Justin Feehan between 1 January 2004 and 12 November 2007. 6 As was put by Mr Stanley QC, who appeared for the applicants on the motion, the subpoena requires the production of any document evidencing any communication in relation to Mr Feehan over a period of nearly four years.
 The case involves a discrete inquiry in relation to his conduct over a short period of time on the morning of 5 May 2004. 8 It was contended by Mr Griffin QC, who appeared for the respondent in the proceeding and to the motion, that there may be documents in existence which were created prior to 5 May 2004, which evidence communication between these two entities and the Australian Building and Construction Commission which evidence the state of mind of some of the witnesses who may be called in the proceeding.
 It is not suggested that either of the persons to whom these subpoenas are addressed will be witnesses in the case but it is put that there may be some documents in existence prior to 5 May 2004 which will show that some witnesses who are to be called in the proceeding may have had a state of mind which would cause them to give the evidence that they are expected to give. 9 The very proposition that was put to justify the subpoena, in my opinion, shows that the subpoena is defective and it is, as Mr Stanley contended, fishing.
 Those communications may not relate to Mr Feehan at all. 12 In those circumstances, both grounds advanced by the applicants on this motion to set aside the subpoena, namely relevance and oppression, have been made out. 13 I make an order setting aside the subpoena directed to Mr Robert Stewart, Master Builders Association of South Australia Inc and an order setting aside the subpoena directed to Mr Chris Schutz, General Manager of SJS Management Services Pty Ltd, trading as Scott Salisbury Homes. 14 Mr Stanley asked for an order that the respondent, who was a party to the proceeding, pay the costs of the applicants on the motion.
