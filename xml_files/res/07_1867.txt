 If 80% or more of an individual's personal services income is from one source and the individual or personal services entity does not meet the results test, they will be a personal services business only if they obtain a personal services business determination.
 Without these amendments, if 80% or more of an individual's personal services income is from one source, the individual or personal services entity is conducting a personal services business only if they obtain a personal services business determination. 7.41 The existing conditions for the results test (which are traditional tests for determining whether a taxpayer is an independent contractor), are in subsections 87-60(5) and 87-65(5). 7.42 Previously the conditions in the results test were only relevant to a personal services business determination.
 Thus, in assessing what the income is "for" and whether the income is "for producing a result" (in s 87-18(3)(a)), one directs attention to all the circumstances of the individual, and in particular, what the individual does at, and with, the ultimate acquirer or requirer of the services.
