 First of all, it is not clear whether the exhibitions at which a non-prejudicial disclosure could be made were: (1) an official international exhibition and (2) an officially recognized international exhibition; or (1) an official exhibition (whether international or not) and (2) an officially recognized international exhibition.
 There one finds, twice used, the expression "official exhibition, or an officially recognized international exhibition. " This suggests that "official" and "officially recognized" are to be understood as modifying only "exhibition" and not the compound "international exhibition. " It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the language of s 47(2) controls the construction of s 47(1).
 The disjunctive juxtaposition of "official" and "international" supports the view that an "official exhibition" is distinct from an "international exhibition", rather than a type of international exhibition. 22 The final point is that on the second reading of the Bill, the Minister said of s 47 that it covered "official or international exhibitions".
 The greater the foreign presence, the more likely it is that an exhibition will be an "international exhibition. " Second, the quality of the foreign exhibitors is a factor; and by "quality" I mean both the geographic location and the importance of the foreign state(s) in the relevant industry.
