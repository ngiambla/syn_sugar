 The delegate said that the appellant had provided no evidence of his involvement in Falun Gong either in China or in Australia and that he did not indicate that he would be able to do so in the future.
 The delegate noted that independent country information suggested that action taken by the Chinese authorities against Falun Gong had been directed against the leaders and organisers of the movement and that ordinary practitioners "such as the applicant" did not appear to have faced any real difficulties.
 The Federal Magistrate held that this conclusion was not "information" and referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 (" SZEEU ").
 The appellant claimed that the Tribunal's finding that there was no evidence at all that he had brought with him to Australia a level of knowledge about the practice of Falun Gong consistent with his claim to have been a practitioner for seven years or, indeed, at all, in China was within s 424A(1) of the Act .
