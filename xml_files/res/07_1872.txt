 It goes on to say that one of the aims of the protocols for the operation of Ministerial Councils: "... is to facilitate high-quality consultative decision-making, through a robust framework that is accountable, fiscally prudent and administratively efficient. " 14 The COAG Compendium sets out a number of general principles for the operation of Ministerial Councils.
 At that meeting the Ministers resolved that their discussions were confidential and that freedom of information requests for records of, or pertaining to discussions were to be met with a claim based on "the appropriate exemption". 17 The Policy Paper adopted in July 2007 may be seen as a continuation of the earlier policy, although stated in more expanded form.
 That resolution provided that discussions at meetings of SCAG are confidential and that freedom of information requests for records of, or pertaining to those discussions are to be met with claims for the appropriate exemption. 42 The issue before me was not whether any exemption under freedom of information legislation would be upheld.
