 In short, Mr Narain did not personally contravene s 1041H ; and (c) the representations in the 27 September letter alleged by the Commission were not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. 59 The expressions "financial product" and "financial service" are defined in Divs 3 and 4 of Pt 7.1 of the Act .
 In short it was not a statement that was in relation to, or was related to, shares in CIL. 63 Mr Narain submitted that s 1041H dealt with the mischief of false statements in product disclosure statements, prospectuses and circulars concerning share issues and other securities and that ss 1041E and 1041F were sections which caught announcements in relation to subject-matter such as the 27 September letter.
 A consistent theme running through the case is that the expression "in relation to" gathers its meaning from the context in which it appears and the purpose for which it appears: see, eg, Oceanic Life Ltd v Chief Commissioner of Stamp Duties [1999] NSWCA 416 ; (1999) 168 ALR 211 at 225, per Fitzgerald JA.
 That is an inadequate factual basis for finding that Mr Narain engaged in the conduct of either preparing or sending that letter to the Stock Exchange. 77 I am not satisfied that Mr Narain personally engaged in any conduct relating to the preparation or sending of the 29 September letter. 78 The 27 September letter raises different issues.
