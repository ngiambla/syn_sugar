 CTF believes that an equally valid and more accessible market for Citrofresh is for use as a penile sanitizer pre or post intercourse ..." That letter, as did the 27 September letter, contained the name of Mr Narain as one of two persons to contact for further enquiries. 13 Between 1 September 2005 and 26 September 2005, CIL shares traded on the Stock Exchange between $0.20 per share and $0.25 per share.
 Shortly after the 27 September letter was sent to the Stock Exchange and released to the market, CIL shares traded on the Stock Exchange as high as $0.70 per share and were trading at $0.53.5 per share when the Stock Exchange applied a trading halt at 3.29pm on 27 September 2005. 14 At the close of trading on 28 September 2005 the price of CIL shares on the Stock Exchange had dropped to $0.35.5 per share and at the close of trading on 30 September 2005 the price of CIL shares on the Stock Exchange had dropped to $0.29.5 per share. 15 The drafting of the 27 September letter evolved in the following manner.
 Mr Taylor and Mr Narain prepared the table on the front page of the announcement and moved the section regarding Retroscreen to the end of the document. 18 At 4.48pm on 26 September 2005 Mr Wright sent an email to Mr Narain enclosing text to be included in the release.
 In short, Mr Narain did not personally contravene s 1041H ; and (c) the representations in the 27 September letter alleged by the Commission were not misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. 59 The expressions "financial product" and "financial service" are defined in Divs 3 and 4 of Pt 7.1 of the Act .
 In short it was not a statement that was in relation to, or was related to, shares in CIL. 63 Mr Narain submitted that s 1041H dealt with the mischief of false statements in product disclosure statements, prospectuses and circulars concerning share issues and other securities and that ss 1041E and 1041F were sections which caught announcements in relation to subject-matter such as the 27 September letter.
 The provisions in the Corporations Act and other applicable legislation will be harmonised to provide a single regime with respect to conduct in relation to financial products. " That provision supports the proposition that in order for conduct to be "in relation to" a financial product, it must on its face have a connection or relationship with the financial product. 65 The critical question is whether Mr Narain engaged in conduct "in relation to" a financial product.
 The words "in relation to" have a very wide meaning, but like the expression "in respect of", they do not extend to "any relationship however tenuous": Technical Products Pty Ltd v State Government Insurance Office (Queensland) [1989] HCA 24 ; (1989) 167 CLR 45 at 51; The Workers' Compensation Board of Queensland v Technical Products Pty Ltd [1988] HCA 49 ; (1988) 165 CLR 642 at 653-654.
 In our view, there is nothing in the present context to suggest that the term 'relating to', where used in s 580 and when picked up by s 581(4) , was not intended to have a wide operation or that an indirect, but relevant, connection would not be a sufficient relationship for present purposes. " 71 The analysis and propositions considered in these cases must be approached with caution as context is all important in considering the proper interpretation and reach of general expressions such as "in relation to".
 That is an inadequate factual basis for finding that Mr Narain engaged in the conduct of either preparing or sending that letter to the Stock Exchange. 77 I am not satisfied that Mr Narain personally engaged in any conduct relating to the preparation or sending of the 29 September letter. 78 The 27 September letter raises different issues.
 The act of sending the letter to the Stock Exchange was not undertaken by Mr Narain personally; it was undertaken personally by CIL's company secretary and it was undertaken by CIL. 80 The claim made against Mr Narain is one of direct personal liability, not accessorial liability or indirect liability.
