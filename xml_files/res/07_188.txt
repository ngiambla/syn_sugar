 The respondent Commissioner of Taxation assessed those repayments as liable to fringe benefits tax under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) (the FBT Act) in the FBT years ended 31 March 2000, 2001 and 2002. 2 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal allowed the appeal of the Company: Slade Bloodstock Pty Ltd and Commissioner of Taxation [2006] AATA 660 .
 The only remaining issue is whether the Commissioner has shown that the Tribunal made an error of law in concluding that the repayments were not "in respect of the employment of an employee" within the meaning of s 5B and thus liable to tax under s 66(1).
 The Company's turnover and profit or loss for the following financial years was as follows: 2000 2001 2002 Turnover 200,000 355,000 836,000 Profit/Loss (616) (9,907) 29,058 6 On 28 April 1999 Mr and Mrs Slade entered into a "shareholders loan agreement" with the Company.
