 The evidence shows that Arthur Que Noy and Marjorie Foster (Ms Foster) are named as representatives of the Kamu people, Gabriel Hazelbane is named as a representative of the Warai people and Paddy Huddleston is named as a representative of the Wagiman people.
 They focus upon the status of the current applicant to make the application or that applicant's conduct in relation to that application, and upon the putative applicant's authorisation to make and deal with matter arising in relation to that primary application.
 The status of the proposed new applicant to pursue the motion under s 66B require those cumulative conditions to be satisfied, but not necessarily an explicit separate authorisation by the claim group to seek an order under s 66B.
 I have expressed my conclusion that way because, as noted in [8] above, s 253 and s 61(2) together appear to treat "the applicant" as all persons authorised by a claim group to make and deal with an application.
