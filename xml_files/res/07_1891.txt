 Subclause 7 sets out a number of criteria (a) to (f) and those criteria include criterion (d) that the applicant has net assets of not less than $AUD250,000 to conduct or establish the business or alternatively a lesser amount that the Minister considers to be adequate to conduct or establish the business.
 Secondly, the Tribunal failed to identify the nature of the business; was distracted by the negative balance sheet of Faulkner Technologies Pty Ltd ('Technologies'); and failed to appreciate that the appellant's shareholding Technologies and Faulkner Technology Holdings Pty Ltd ('Holdings') was an asset of the appellant and ought to have been considered in applying the test of whether the appellant had net assets adequate to conduct the business.
 The appellant says the Tribunal's discussion under the heading 'Net business assets' of the financial circumstances of Technologies; the profit and loss statement for 1 July 2004 to 31 October 2004 and the October 2004 balance sheet for Technologies led to two conclusions at [28] and [29] of the Tribunal's reasons that betray error in the test actually applied by the Tribunal.
 It is not correct to say therefore that the Tribunal did not consider the type and nature of the business, the essential intellectual property character of the software assets or 'knowledge engines', the shareholding of the appellant in Holdings and postulated values of that interest as an asset of the appellant.
