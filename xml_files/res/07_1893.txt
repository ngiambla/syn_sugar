 The Tribunal accepted that, although the corrupt officials asked him to do work without pay, he had enough money to support his family.
 However, the Tribunal did not consider that withholding money for work performed would necessarily amount to persecution. 8 The Tribunal accepted the husband's claim that Mr W and other police officers visited his home in January 2006 to remove commercial documents from those premises.
 The way in which the Tribunal analysed the evidence and came to the conclusion that Mr W and his supporters were not persecuting the appellants for political reasons does not disclose any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. 21 Having reviewed the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the federal magistrate, I am not satisfied that there is any basis upon which this appeal should be allowed.
