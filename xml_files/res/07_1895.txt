 While there is much force in the criticisms of the generality of the assertions made by the plaintiff, I am satisfied in the words of Lockhart J that the claim in respect of damages for infringement is one " that may have some substance . " 40 Having regard to the expert evidence of Mr Fox, the claims are, it seems to me, genuine claims put forward in good faith, and which are more than mere assertion.
 Without looking too deeply at the issues of validity and infringement, the claims of the plaintiff in respect of damages for infringement are such that they have " some real chance of success ", to use the words of Young J in Intag Microelectronics Pty Ltd v AWA Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 284 at 289. 41 In my opinion, the conclusion that there is an offsetting claim in respect of the costs orders made by the Court on 9 August 2004 are even stronger. 42 On that day, the Court ordered that the decision of the AAT to affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents to decline an extension of time was set aside, and the matter was remitted to the AAT for consideration according to law.
 I think the figure of $97,825.58 is simply the addition of the solicitor's professional fees and outlays, and the fees for Senior and Junior Counsel, together with the costs of the assessment described as " anticipated " of the assessment, being a rounded figure of $3,000.00. 52 Notwithstanding the significant evidentiary difficulties and uncertainties concerning a cross claim for costs by the plaintiff against the defendant, I am satisfied that there is a claim for costs in respect of 69 of 2003.
 I am further satisfied that in respect of both proceeding 69 of 2003, and proceedings 174 of 2004, there is a cross claim by the plaintiff against the defendant that exceeds the amount of the debt in the statutory demand. 53 On this cross demand also, I would set aside the statutory demand. 54 I set aside the statutory demand on each of the bases referred to above.
