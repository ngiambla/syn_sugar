 The Tribunal conducted a review and on 5 October 2005 decided to affirm the decision not to grant a protection visa. 3 The applicant submits that the Tribunal made three errors of law which went to its jurisdiction.
 It said that its finding that the applicant was not of interest to the Iranian authorities was reinforced by the absence of information indicating that Iranians had been targeted merely for being friends with a Baha'i family.
 He gave evidence of such an intention, and it was appropriate for the Tribunal to consider that question in view of the evidence that those of the Baha'i faith are a persecuted religious minority in Iran.
