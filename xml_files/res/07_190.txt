 On 10 August 2004 a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (the Minister) refused to grant a protection visa and on 14 September 2004 the applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) for review of the delegate's decision.
 On 9 October 2006, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application pursuant to rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) on the basis that the applicant had failed to demonstrate an arguable case.
 The evidence before the reconstituted Tribunal omitted any mention of damage to the property until he was reminded of his previous evidence. 9 The Tribunal, having summarised those three matters, then observed that the applicant's evidence in relation to his material claims varied constantly during the hearing.
