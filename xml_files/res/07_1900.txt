 On 7 March 2005 that letter was returned to the Department but without notation. 14 On 12 July 2006 the applicant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision claiming that he had not received the decision refusing the grant of the visa until 11 July 2006.
 Section 348 of the Act provides that the Tribunal only has jurisdiction to review an MRT-reviewable decision if an application was properly made under s 347. 16 Section 338 of the Act and reg 4.02 of the Regulations define the various decisions that are MRT-reviewable decisions.
 First, the decision sought to be reviewed was not an MRT-reviewable decision in that the applicant was not sponsored by an approved sponsor and the proposed sponsor had not lodged an application for review with the Tribunal at the time the applicant's application for review to the Tribunal was made.
 Nor had an application been made for review of a decision not to approve the sponsor been made. 27 I agree with the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction on the ground that the applicant was not sponsored by an approved sponsor or the proposed sponsor had not lodged an application for review with the Tribunal at the time the applicant's application for a review was made.
