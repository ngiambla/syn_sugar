 Section 348 of the Act provides that the Tribunal only has jurisdiction to review an MRT-reviewable decision if an application was properly made under s 347. 16 Section 338 of the Act and reg 4.02 of the Regulations define the various decisions that are MRT-reviewable decisions.
 First, the decision sought to be reviewed was not an MRT-reviewable decision in that the applicant was not sponsored by an approved sponsor and the proposed sponsor had not lodged an application for review with the Tribunal at the time the applicant's application for review to the Tribunal was made.
