 INTRODUCTION History 1 In Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (No 2) [2007] FCA 493 (' Telstra No 2' ), I considered a Part A competition notice ('the Competition Notice') issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('the Commission') pursuant to s 151AKA(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act').
 The enabling legislation provides the reason why the Commission was not entitled to issue the Competition Notice. 75 All of these matters suggest a contrary intention, that is, an intention that the Commission is not entitled to make wholesale changes to the Part A competition notice by the application of the rules of construction in s 46 of the Interpretation Act .
 They do not agree on the nature of the declaration. 97 Telstra seeks a declaration that ' the decision of [the Commission] made on or about 12 April 2006 under section 151AKA ' of the Act to issue the Competition Notice was invalid.
