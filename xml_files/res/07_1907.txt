 The respondent parties are satisfied and have the view that the native title rights and interests set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft determination (being orders 3 and 4) are substantiated by the traditional laws and customs, as described in the connection material provided on behalf of the Eastern Kuku Yalanji People. 30 Paragraph 225(c) deals with the nature and extent of any other interests in relation to the Determination Area.
 The native title rights and interests the subject of orders 3(b) and 4 (but not 3(a)) do not confer possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the Determination Area on the native title holders to the exclusion of all others in relation to the entire claim area. 33 The orders, which are consistent with the terms agreed by the parties, recognise that the Eastern Kuku Yalanji People, as the common law holders of the native title in the Determination Area, are entitled to some exclusive, as well as non-exclusive, use and enjoyment of the land and waters in accordance with their traditional laws and customs.
 I am satisfied that the native title rights and interests are to be held on trust by the Jabalbina Yalanji Aboriginal Corporation for the common law holders of the native title. 38 I am satisfied that it is within the power of the Court to make the orders sought and that these orders can appropriately be made to give effect to the parties' agreement without a full hearing of the applicant's claim.
