 The appellate jurisdiction of the Court is exercised by a single judge: s 25(1AA) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the FCA Act "). 4 The Amended Notice of Appeal contained one ground of appeal: that the Federal Magistrate erred in not finding that the RRT committed a "jurisdictional error" in that the decision of the RRT was affected by apprehended bias. 5 The notice of appeal seeks an order that the decision made by the Federal Magistrate be set aside, the decision of the RRT be set aside and that "[a] writ of Certiorari issue directed to the [RRT] to quash its decision and the application be remitted to the [RRT] for further consideration according to law" (para [3]).
 The appellant's request that he be permitted to bring new evidence was not particularised and no attempt was made by him to explain how the additional material might be relevant to the allegation of apprehended bias (see [2007] FMCA 1267 at para [23] ).
 On 17 February 2006, the RRT advised the appellant that the hearing would resume on 27 March 2006 and on 24 March 2006, the RRT advised the appellant that the hearing would resume on 10 April 2006. 15 The appellant attended the resumed hearing on 10 April 2006 and submitted further documents.
 Although this statement was not entirely accurate, the appellant makes no complaint about this aspect of the RRT's decision making process. 18 Finally, the appellant was subsequently informed that the RRT had made its decision and was invited to attend the handing down of the decision by the RRT on 6 June 2006.
