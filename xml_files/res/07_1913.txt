 Mr Rivera remains in extradition detention but he is now in the Parklea Correctional Centre pending extradition to the United States. 2 On 29 May 2006, Mr Rivera filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that the conditions of his detention were contrary to his human rights.
 Please note that the President may decide to decline to continue an inquiry into a complaint if he is of the view that there is a more appropriate remedy in relation to the subject matter of the complaint that is reasonably available to the complainant (section 20(2)(c)(iv) of the HREOCA).
 At this stage, it's simply too premature for the President to form the view that my statement of claim would be a more appropriate remedy. 19 On 30 August 2007 the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services sent a fax to Ms McCabe.
 The reference to July 2007 instead of 2 April 2007 was not an operative error. 30 I also reject Mr Rivera's submission that the reference to the statement of claim dated July 2007 suggests that he "intentionally defied the Commission's warning".
