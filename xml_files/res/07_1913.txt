 Please note that the President may decide to decline to continue an inquiry into a complaint if he is of the view that there is a more appropriate remedy in relation to the subject matter of the complaint that is reasonably available to the complainant (section 20(2)(c)(iv) of the HREOCA).
 The reference to July 2007 instead of 2 April 2007 was not an operative error. 30 I also reject Mr Rivera's submission that the reference to the statement of claim dated July 2007 suggests that he "intentionally defied the Commission's warning".
