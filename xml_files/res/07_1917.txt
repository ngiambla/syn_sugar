 Section 665(1)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ") provides that, where an employer has contravened s 659 in relation to the termination of employment of an employee, the Court can impose a penalty of not more than $10,000.
 I stated previously that a penalty should be imposed in this case, although I left for further submission and evidence, if need be, the amount of that penalty. 3 In submissions yesterday, counsel for the respondent referred to Mason v Harrington Corporation Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 7 ( "Mason" ) and Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ( "Kelly" ).
 As counsel for Mr Claveria rightly conceded, FSU concerned conduct of a very different nature to that impugned in the present case: see Merkel J's characterisation of the conduct in FSU at [59] as "flagrant and deliberate".
