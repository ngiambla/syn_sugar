 Section 665(1)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ") provides that, where an employer has contravened s 659 in relation to the termination of employment of an employee, the Court can impose a penalty of not more than $10,000.
 Rather, it is appropriate to order, under s 665(1)(d) , that the respondent make a payment, in respect of Mr Claveria, to the superannuation trustee in an amount that represents what Mr Claveria has lost by reason of the respondent's failure to make superannuation contributions for him between the date of his termination and his reinstatement.
 Hence the limit or cap is the total amount of remuneration which was: (i) received by the employee; or (ii) to which the employee was entitled (whichever is higher) --- for any period of employment with the employer during the period of 6 months immediately before the termination (here, 24 January 2007).
 The respondent argued that, if the court, in the exercise of its discretion, determined that the maximum amount of compensation payable under the cap (or some lesser amount) was appropriate, then any deductions (such as those referred to in [12] above) should be made from this amount.
