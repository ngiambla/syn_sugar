 Section 61(2)(c) and (d) is more specific in its terms in regard to the Applicants, stating that ..." (c) the person is, or the persons are jointly, the applicant and "(d) none of the other members of the native title claim group or compensation claim group is the applicant. " In the present situation where two applicants have removed themselves without consulting the claim group or other applicants, the remaining applicants have been left to make decisions.
 Ms Campbell noted, ' Similarly, where applicants pass away, authorisation meetings are not held to reaffirm that the applicant is authorised, or to replace applicants' . 30 On 24 March 2006, the Gurang Land Council received a letter dated the previous day from the National Native Title Tribunal with the registration test reasons for decision attached.
 This view of authorisation does not however prevent revocation if it were considered to be necessary. ' 55 The contention by the Attorney-General is that the conclusion of Kiefel J is wrong, because it is inconsistent with the text of s 61(2) of the Act, and inconsistent with other provisions of the Act. 56 For my part, I do not see the authorisation of a number of persons as an 'applicant' as being an appointment of each of them 'jointly and severally' to deal with the matters arising with the matters in relation to an application.
 In other circumstances, it is used to refer to each person (who must be a member of the claim group) who has been authorised to be an applicant. 66 It is helpful to recall that s 62(1) commences: 'A claimant application (a) must be accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the applicant: (i) that the applicant believes ... ; and (ii) that the applicant believes ... ; and ...' 67 As a matter of language (and in fact of practice), the requirements of s 62 are satisfied by the filing of affidavits by each of the persons who constitute ' the applicant ' deposing to the specified beliefs.
