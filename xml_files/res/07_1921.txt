 In response, the applicants say that Mr Waters sought advice from Mr Pan on 13 June 1996 by facsimile and the advice sought was given by Mr Pan and Mr Ebbage to Mr Waters acting on his own behalf and that of Mrs Waters at a meeting that took place at Brisbane on 15 August 1996.
 The respondents say that the response does not particularise whether the advice received from Mr Ebbage and Mr Pan was written or oral or partly written and partly oral and no particulars have been given as to that part of the advice said to have been given to Waters by Mr Ebbage and that given by Mr Pan.
 By para 31 the applicants say that in the circumstances of the particulars pleaded in paras 22 and 30 of the SoC an inference arises that Jefferson and Stevenson, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, the BSA and the liquidator of Delvine were creditors for large sums of money; a time would come for payment of those monies by Waters; and Waters would not be able to pay.
