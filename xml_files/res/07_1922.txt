 The appellant's and respondents' boxes were sold side by side at Stuff and Nonsense as well as in the respondents' store in Eastland. 41 The learned Magistrate found that at least one example of each type of photo box was displayed out of its carton in retail outlets.
 When removed from their cardboard box the parties' photo boxes were virtually indistinguishable. 44 Mr Zheng's evidence as to how he came to market the photo boxes was as follows.
 Later in response to demands from the appellant, the respondents covered the whole of the large stickers with white paper and later still black paper. 47 The respondents sold 676 units with the word "memento" covered by the white stickers.
 All photo boxes sold by the respondents had the Better Homeware brand on them. 48 The learned Magistrate accepted Mr Zheng's evidence except in relation to the instructions that he gave his supplier for the packaging.
