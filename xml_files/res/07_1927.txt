 The Tribunal found that the appellant had invented his claims in relation to his Falun Gong activities in China. 5 The appellant gave evidence before the Tribunal and made submissions to it at a video-conference hearing on 27 October 2006.
 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 (2002) 209 CLR 597, the High Court held that, when the Immigration Review Tribunal had denied an applicant procedural fairness, it was open to that tribunal to take the view that it had not performed its statutory function, to set aside its purported decision and to revisit the matter.
 Those jurisdictional facts are not specified and the appellant has not expanded upon that ground in argument. 17 The only other ground is that the Tribunal failed to accept that the appellant is a Falun Gong practitioner.
 Indeed, as the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment demonstrate, the appellant did attempt to challenge in that court various findings of the Tribunal, on the basis that they were not reasonable, or were illogical.
