 Although the genesis of the claim is a contract between the parties which contains a clause in which the respondent submits to the jurisdiction of the Court, a question will arise as to whether the clause is an exclusive jurisdiction clause. 3 The respondent has filed a motion under Order 9 rule 7 of the Federal Court Rules seeking to set aside the order that was made upon it for service outside the jurisdiction.
 The issue which will arise on the hearing of that motion, which has been listed before me for hearing on 19 February 2008, will be as to the question of the jurisdiction of this Court. 4 The effect of Order 8 rule 3(2) is that one of the elements of which the Court has to be satisfied is that it has jurisdiction in the proceeding.
 He submits that on the hearing of the motion it is for the applicant to justify the order for service out of the jurisdiction, including the requirement that the applicant has a prima facie case for relief. 6 The authorities in this area establish that in determining such an issue, an applicant proceeds upon the basis that it need only establish the existence of a prima facie case at a stage in the proceeding where the procedures of the court, including discovery, have not been invoked. 7 Dr Bell relies, in particular, upon the observations of Giles J in News Corporation Ltd v Lenfest Communications Inc (1996) 40 NSWLR 250 at 261.
 It is convenient to set out the relevant passage of Giles J judgment, which is as follows: But against them stands the compelling consideration that Lenfest is a foreign corporation, served out of Australia, over which the Court asserts jurisdiction only when it is sufficiently shown by News that (inter alia) the proceedings fall within one of the cases in Pt 10 , r 1A of the Supreme Court Rules .
