 Although the genesis of the claim is a contract between the parties which contains a clause in which the respondent submits to the jurisdiction of the Court, a question will arise as to whether the clause is an exclusive jurisdiction clause. 3 The respondent has filed a motion under Order 9 rule 7 of the Federal Court Rules seeking to set aside the order that was made upon it for service outside the jurisdiction.
 The issue which will arise on the hearing of that motion, which has been listed before me for hearing on 19 February 2008, will be as to the question of the jurisdiction of this Court. 4 The effect of Order 8 rule 3(2) is that one of the elements of which the Court has to be satisfied is that it has jurisdiction in the proceeding.
