 The method of delivery was described in a way which was not restricted to infrastructure or equipment provided or connected to Foxtel customers. 2 A standard 'access agreement', which was Appendix 2 to the undertaking, identified in detail the circumstances in which Foxtel would actually provide the identified services.
 The terms of Appendix 2 made clear that Foxtel would be under no obligation to provide services to other telecommunication service providers using infrastructure or equipment which was not supplied by Foxtel pursuant to a current subscription arrangement with its individual customers.
 The practical effect of the stipulations was that Foxtel would not provide services to other telecommunication service providers which effectively allowed transmissions of material except to persons who were, at the relevant time, Foxtel's own customers who held a current subscription. 3 Foxtel characterised the stipulations as 'terms and conditions' about the manner of delivery of services.
 If terms and conditions are specified in a special access undertaking which is accepted by the ACCC there may not be a future arbitration which imposes obligations inconsistent with the terms and conditions. 25 The ACCC is directed that it must either accept or reject a special access undertaking (s 152CBC(2)).
