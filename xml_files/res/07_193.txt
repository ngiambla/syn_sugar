 Mr Guest's tax returns 59 For the tax years 1988 to 1991 (both inclusive) Mr Guest declared as taxable income the proceeds received from the sale of fruit and claimed interest on the Rural Finance loan as an allowable deduction.
 The Full Court (Lee, RD Nicholson and Merkel JJ) upheld the decision of the trial judge that there was a sufficient connection between the occasion for the payment of interest and the carrying on of the business.
