 Section 87 of the Act allows the Court, if it is satisfied that such an order is within its power, to make an order in, or consistent with, the terms of the parties' written agreement without holding a hearing. 8 Where the Court makes an order in which a determination of native title is made, s 94A of the Act requires the Court to set out details of the matters mentioned in s 225.
 On the basis of these interviews, and also based upon the outcome of the group meetings, it is the opinion of the research anthropologist that there is a widespread consensus in the regional Aboriginal community, that the claimants are; (1) Ngadjon-Jii, and (2) that they are the 'Traditional Owners' of the lands and water under claim by the claimant group. ' 16 Dr Pannell's report contains many examples in which the Ngadjon-Jii People have maintained their connection to the determination area.
 TERMS OF THE PROPOSED ORDER: 19 The proposed order, which is consistent with the terms agreed by the parties, recognises that the Ngadjon-Jii People, as the holders of the native title in the determination area, are entitled to the exclusive and non-exclusive use and enjoyment of the land and waters in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. 20 The proposed orders further recognise other interests in the determination area and the relationship of those interests with the native title interests.
