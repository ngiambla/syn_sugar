 The Liquidator agrees to notify ASIC upon conclusion of the winding up or subject to any order made by the Court so that the company may be deregistered. 15 I am satisfied those conditions will be met.
 The only faintly comparable instance I can find of a case to support any suggestion that a liquidator may be unnecessary is Johnston v Centralian Industries Pty Ltd (1995) 13 ACLC 1,064.
 The insurer appealed against that order contending that such an order was available only where the defendant could not be located and notice of the writ was unlikely to reach the defendant.
