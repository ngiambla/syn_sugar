 Factual and procedural background 2 Pastor Dorogori sought joinder as a party under s 84(5) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NT Act) by a motion filed on 22 July 2005, which was purportedly brought on behalf of Hiamo-Tureture Villagers.
 The motion was adjourned by order of Connard DDR on 25 August 2005 with a direction that any further affidavits upon which Pastor Dorogori proposed to rely should be filed and served by 8 September 2005 and that they should address the requirements of s 84 of the NT Act.
 On 22 September 2005 no affidavits had been filed and the notice of motion was dismissed by Connard DDR with no order as to costs. 3 Pastor Dorogori filed the motion now before the Court on 30 April 2007 in effect seeking review of the order of dismissal made on 22 September 2005.
 It was entitled: HOW WE HIAMO UMUMERE TRIBES SEPARATED OURSELF FROM DARU AND BOBO ISLAND 5 Pastor Dorogori referred to historical attacks upon Hiamo people living on Daru Island by other indigenous people in the area.
 He claimed to be an original inhabitant of the area. 10 The motion was opposed by the applicants on the basis that it was out of time and that there was no satisfactory explanation for the delay.
 The time limit for seeking review of a Registrar's decision prescribed for the purposes of s 35A(5) is set out in O 46, r 7B(1) which provides: Subject to any direction by the Court or a Judge to the contrary, an application under subsection 35A(5) of the Act for review of the exercise of a power of the Court by a Registrar under subsection 35A(1) of the Act must be made by motion on notice within 21 days after the day on which the power was exercised.
 Statutory framework --- joinder 16 The application for joinder was made under s 84 of the NT Act which, as it stood at the time of the Registrar's decision, provided in subs (5): The Federal Court may at any time join any person as a party to the proceedings, if the Court is satisfied that the person's interests may be affected by a determination in the proceedings.
