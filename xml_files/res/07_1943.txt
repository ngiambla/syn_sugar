 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 1 It is a condition precedent to the formation of any contract for the supply of goods and services to a Retailer pursuant to these Purchase Terms that the Retailer has been approved by the Company and the Supplier to place orders electronically through the Company and no notice has been received by the Supplier that the Retailer is no longer approved to receive supply under these Purchase Terms ("Approved Retailers").
 To the extent that those observations related to court appointed receivers and managers, they apply with greater force to receivers and managers privately appointed with extensive powers under a company charge. [44] In Re Jay-O-Bees Pty Ltd (in liq) (2004) 50 ACSR 565; [2004] NSWSC 818 Campbell J said (at [46]): [46] The appeal to the court from a liquidator's rejection of a proof of debt arises under s 1321 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
 No order could be made by the Court which would differentiate between the entitlements to or the burden of the individual applicants in respect of such costs. 76 Were the joinder of the several cases in one set of proceedings to be permitted, the burden falling upon the Court would be considerably greater than that which would be the case if each case was dealt with separately.
 Amendment of an Application requires an order of the Court that a document in the proceeding be amended or that leave be granted to a party to amend the document in such manner as the Court thinks fit (see Order 13 rule 2(1)). 84 If a pleading is amended pursuant to Order 13 rule 3(1) without leave the Court may by order disallow the amendment. 85 The applicants' application for a grant of leave to file the Amended Application (MFI 'B') and the Amended Statement of Claim (MFI 'C') has been addressed by the parties as what one might call a pre-emptive application for summary dismissal under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
