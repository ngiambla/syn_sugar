 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 1 It is a condition precedent to the formation of any contract for the supply of goods and services to a Retailer pursuant to these Purchase Terms that the Retailer has been approved by the Company and the Supplier to place orders electronically through the Company and no notice has been received by the Supplier that the Retailer is no longer approved to receive supply under these Purchase Terms ("Approved Retailers").
 To the extent that those observations related to court appointed receivers and managers, they apply with greater force to receivers and managers privately appointed with extensive powers under a company charge. [44] In Re Jay-O-Bees Pty Ltd (in liq) (2004) 50 ACSR 565; [2004] NSWSC 818 Campbell J said (at [46]): [46] The appeal to the court from a liquidator's rejection of a proof of debt arises under s 1321 Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
 No order could be made by the Court which would differentiate between the entitlements to or the burden of the individual applicants in respect of such costs. 76 Were the joinder of the several cases in one set of proceedings to be permitted, the burden falling upon the Court would be considerably greater than that which would be the case if each case was dealt with separately.
