 In proceeding NSD 1448 of 2007, I had ordered that the plaintiff, Crown Limited (Crown), convene a meeting of all holders of shares in Crown for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to a scheme of arrangement (Demerger Scheme). 2 The PBL Scheme Meeting was held on 23 November 2007 and the Demerger Scheme Meeting was held later on the same day. 3 The PBL Shareholders present and voting (either in person or by proxy) passed a resolution approving the PBL Scheme by the majorities referred to in s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act).
