 Mr Feltis admitted that he was directly knowingly concerned in and party to Netti Atom's contravening conduct for the purposes of being subject to injunctions (s 80(1)(e)) and pecuniary penalties (s 76(1)(e)). 5 The principle underlying the prohibition in s 48 is that competition in the distribution of goods and services is undermined if vertical price restraints, such as resale price maintenance, are permitted.
 The letter stated that while Netti Atom will continue to provide dealers with recommended prices, it "[does] not require Dealers to sell bikes at these or any other prices [and] Dealers will not lose their dealership status if they sell bikes at other prices. " The respondents also substantially acceded to the relief sought by the Commission at an early stage of the proceeding.
 The statement of claim was filed on 1 August 2007 and in their defence, which was filed on 3 September 2007, the respondents agreed with each proposed remedy with the exception of certain proposed adverse publicity orders.
 Netti Atom's conduct and financial position is most similar to that found in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd (2005) ATPR |P42-072 and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Tooltechnic Systems (Aust) Pty Ltd (2007) ATPR |P42-154, where penalties of $250,000, $150,000 and $125,000 respectively were imposed against the corporate respondents.
