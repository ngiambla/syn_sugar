 It includes income that "is dealt with on behalf of the bankrupt or as the bankrupt directs": s 139M(1)(c). 5 For the purposes of this application the relevant contribution assessment period is 4 June 2005 to 3 June 2006.
 In his notice of objection the trustee alleges that the bankrupt failed to disclose other income, namely twelve monthly payments of, respectively, $1,610 and $2,600 each that had been paid by Lockwood Investments (Australia) Pty Ltd into "two investment property loan accounts" with Westpac Banking Corporation.
 From that account $1,610 per month was paid into account number 71-11129 and $2,500 per month was paid into account number 71-1110. 14 Upon these facts the first question that arises is whether the monthly payments were income derived by the bankrupt.
 Because the bankrupt in this case could not act on his knowledge and exercise any control over the funds (because the accounts were frozen), the credit entry in the accounts may be regarded as a mere technical receipt rather than income. 25 As regards the application of s 139L(1)(a)(v), it is certainly true that the word "benefit" is given a very wide meaning.
