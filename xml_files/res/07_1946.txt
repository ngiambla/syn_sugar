 In his notice of objection the trustee alleges that the bankrupt failed to disclose other income, namely twelve monthly payments of, respectively, $1,610 and $2,600 each that had been paid by Lockwood Investments (Australia) Pty Ltd into "two investment property loan accounts" with Westpac Banking Corporation.
 The objection states that: "Disclosure of the payments received would have increased [the bankrupt's] income by approximately $50,520 and generated a liability to pay income contributions. " 6 It is common ground that Lockwood Investments made the payments to which the notice refers.
