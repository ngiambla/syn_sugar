 In a formal sense, therefore, she has satisfied the requirements of s 33C(1)(a). 10 On the other hand, the statement of the applicant's claim will likely not remain in its current form.
 Accordingly the duty that is payable on land on which a house is constructed is more than the duty that would be payable on the transfer of the land if it had no house.
 According to the statement of the applicant's claim each agent was involved in the scheme; the tenth respondent allegedly operated the agency between September 1999 and February 2004 when the fifth respondent took over the operation of that agency (though there may have been some overlap late in February).
 The tenth respondent was joined because it was the agent with whom some group members dealt. 13 In substance, therefore, the proceeding does not comply with s 33C(1)(a), although, in a technical sense, that may not become apparent unless (as is likely) the statement of the applicant's claim is amended.
