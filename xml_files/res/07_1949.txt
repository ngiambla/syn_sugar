 That letter in response stated in part: I have not been provided a transcription or recording tape for the Departmental interview up to now; and I am not sure that it is my mistakes or the ones caused by the interpreter.
 The opportunity was extended to the Appellant to comment in such manner as he saw fit in response to the Tribunal's letter. 16 Third, the first occasion upon which a copy of the transcript or a copy of any tape recording was sought was subsequent to the Tribunal hearing.
 The Federal Magistrates Court expressed that: [28] Turning to the Applicant's claims in his application, I am not of the view that the Applicant has any entitlement to receive any tape-recording or transcript of an interview with an officer of the Department of Immigration Citizenship.
 Thus it is clear that the " clear particulars " had in fact been provided to the Appellant and, to the extent that findings were made as to any " inconsistencies ", s 424A does not apply to such matters.
