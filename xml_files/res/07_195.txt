 The applicant says that his statement of claim in the principal proceeding is 67 pages, her Honour's judgment is 37 pages, the judgment of her Honour is a 'final judgment' and thus he has 21 days from publication of the judgment to file a notice of appeal. 4 The applicant further says that alternatively, her Honour's judgment may be an 'interlocutory judgment' in which event, he says, he has 'seven days to file a notice of appeal'.
 Her Honour observed at paragraph 120 of the judgment that: 'It is arguable that the applicant was coerced. ' Having regard to those two matters, her Honour was in error it is said, in concluding that the statement of claim does not disclose any connection or nexus between conduct on the part of the respondents and a claim for personal injury on the part of the applicant.
 The particular circumstance advanced by Mr Rogers is that during the period between pronouncement of the judgment and the hearing of this application in February 2007, Mr Rogers has not been in a position to prepare a notice of appeal and therefore he proceeded on the footing that an application ought to be made within 21 days seeking an extension of time within which to prepare, file and serve a notice of appeal.
 Rather, Mr Rogers seeks to identify by oral submissions grounds going to an arguable error on the part of her Honour, secure an allowance for such further time as the court determines and then file and serve a notice of appeal within such time as might be allowed. 38 I propose to determine the application on the following basis. 39 Since the respondents contend that the effect of her Honour's order would be to bring about a res judicata in respect of the claims Mr Rogers has sought to agitate in his further further amended statement of claim, I propose to treat her Honour's judgment as a final judgment.
