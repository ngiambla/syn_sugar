 The Tribunal accepted that Falun Gong might be considered to be a religion, and that those practising Falun Gong might constitute a particular social group for the purposes of the application of the Convention.
 The Tribunal also accepted that Falun Gong practitioners face persecution in China and that such persecution is for a Convention reason. 6 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was involved with Falun Gong as he claimed.
 The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has practised Falun Gong in Australia, either in public or in private or that he was engaged with Falun Gong in any other manner in Australia.
 The Tribunal finds that the applicant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner and that if he returns to China now or in the foreseeable future, he will not engage in the practice of Falun Gong.
