 A purported change of the scheme's responsible entity is 'ineffective unless it is in accordance with this Division' (s 601FJ(2)) and 'a company cannot be chosen or appointed as the responsible entity or temporary responsible entity of a registered scheme unless it meets the requirements of section 601FA ' (s 601FK ).
 In order to maintain continuity for those persons dealing with the register, a company recorded by ASIC as a responsible entity of a registered scheme remains the responsible entity until the record is altered to name the new entity, notwithstanding anything in Division 2. 34 A responsible entity might retire or be removed by members.
 Since the Notice of Meeting for each scheme recites members calling and arranging to hold a meeting representing 44% (Project 4) and 65% (Project 5) of members, the incorrect inclusion of Whelan, Mack and Bysouth does not reduce the notices to a call for a meeting by members holding interests carrying less than 5% of the votes that may be cast at the meeting.
