 One of her proposed claims was for, among other things, distress caused by the misleading or deceptive conduct, and or negligent misrepresentations, she alleged had been made by Adept's employee, Mr Budin, in November 2004. 12 In consequence of Suncorp's action, Mrs Clark was able to negotiate a settlement of these proceedings with ING.
 They asserted that by force of O 22 r 3 the 'usual' order consequent upon discontinuance of proceedings is that the discontinuing applicant must pay the costs incurred by the relevant respondent up to the date of the notice of discontinuance.
 In addition, claims for relatively small sums (although in the lives of Mr and Mrs Clark, the sum of $250,000 is no doubt of great significance) tend to become swallowed up in the legal costs required to be expended in the final resolution of those claims.
 It is not difficult to see that costs potentially involved in a case like the present, listed for a week's hearing with ING and Adept, could present a formidable burden to Mrs Clark by themselves --- the more so were she to add, as Adept said she should, a second insurer and a second broker.
