 Given his senior position and subject to challenges to specific elements of such testimony in cross-examination, I accept that his statement of purposes and reasons can be regarded in this respect as those of Woodside Petroleum and Woodside Energy.
 He said that the reason for hedging in the first place was "to make sure we can protect cash flow [sic] and maintain the business in a healthy basis to achieve our long term objectives to shareholders".
 He did not, however, accept the proposition that: ... there is no necessary relationship between a hedge contract giving rise to a gain and loss in these proceedings and the sale of oil from Laminaria.?
 He observed that futures contracts and collars were two of the authorised financial instruments and that to the best of his recollection the WTI futures contract was the only instrument used to place cargo specific hedges.
