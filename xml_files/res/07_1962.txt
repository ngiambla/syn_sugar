 INTRODUCTION 1 The principal issue in this proceeding is whether the liability of a director under s 588M(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act ) for insolvent trading is provable in the bankruptcy of the director under s 82(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (the Bankruptcy Act ).
 The reason for the change from a focus upon a creditor recovering a debt to the liquidator recovering loss and damage suffered by a creditor in relation to a debt is set out in pars 200 and 201 of the Discussion Paper and in the legislative proposals then put forward.
 In this matter, the trustee argues that the liability of the directors to the company enforceable by the liquidator under s 588M is unliquidated and does not arise in the circumstances otherwise mentioned in the section, that is, it does not arise by reason of contract, promise or breach of trust.
 In my view, Div 4 of Pt 5.7B of the Corporations Act does not have that purpose or intention. 30 The wording of s 588M(2) also, in my view, tends to confirm that no such dramatic change was contemplated by the introduction of Div 4 of Pt 5.7B.
