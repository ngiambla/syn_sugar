 The reason for the change from a focus upon a creditor recovering a debt to the liquidator recovering loss and damage suffered by a creditor in relation to a debt is set out in pars 200 and 201 of the Discussion Paper and in the legislative proposals then put forward.
 In this matter, the trustee argues that the liability of the directors to the company enforceable by the liquidator under s 588M is unliquidated and does not arise in the circumstances otherwise mentioned in the section, that is, it does not arise by reason of contract, promise or breach of trust.
