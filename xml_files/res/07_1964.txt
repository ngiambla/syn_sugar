 My understanding is that on 15 June 2007 his Honour made an order the effect of which was to provide for the consolidation of the two sets of proceedings. 2 The proceedings as presently constituted were the subject of a Consolidated Application filed 2 July 2007 and a Consolidated Statement of Claim filed 2 July 2007.
 I will not go into the chain of correspondence in any detail beyond indicating that the fifth respondent viewed the applicants' demands as being unwarranted and proffered undertakings which were not acceptable to the applicants in their terms. 10 Upon the motion coming before the Court today the fifth respondent sought an adjournment of the motion.
 A further order was made in respect of similar conduct in relation to another party. 13 It is said by the applicants that the conduct complained of was in the nature of contempt of court and that it was appropriate for threatened contempt to be the subject of restraint by injunctive relief.
