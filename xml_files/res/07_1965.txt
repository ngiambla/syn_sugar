 Virtually all of its laundry and about 60% of its dry cleaning are done at the Richmond premises. 59 At the time of Heads of Agreement and the Deed Poll of Restraint, Tip Top provided dry cleaning to retail customers and laundry services, both retail and wholesale.
 The prohibition does not apply to dry cleaning services which, at the date of the agreement: (a) were carried out by the applicants or their related entities; and (b) were not carried out by the respondents or their related entities. 111 An evaluation of the reasonableness of the restraint requires first and foremost an answer to the question: What dry cleaning services were provided by Old Co at the date of the Heads of Agreement?
