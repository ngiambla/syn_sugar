 In October 2004 the Bank's solicitors wrote to the applicants' former solicitors reiterating that the applicants' claim against the Bank was hopeless as the applicants had executed a Deed of Release in 2002. 6 The Bank expressly pleaded the Deed of Release in its defence filed on 1 November 2004.
 They argue, however, that there should not be an immediately enforceable order for party and party costs followed by the possibility of a "top up" order because that could involve two taxations, with attendant duplication of effort and cost. 18 I should say something briefly about the Bank's submission that this Court can order either indemnity costs or solicitor and own client costs as alternatives to party and party costs.
 The Full Court assumed, without discussion, that both types of costs orders were available in this Court. 21 In G E Dal Pont, Law of Costs (Butterworths, 2003) the learned author notes that there is conflicting authority in Australia as to whether indemnity costs differ from solicitor and own client costs.
 He observes that New South Wales, the Northern Territory, and Queensland have specifically removed any power there may once have been to order costs on a solicitor and own client basis, retaining only the power to order costs on either a party and party or an indemnity basis.
