 An inference therefore arises that they are the children referred to in par 11 and consequently the only children considered by the Minister in the context of primary considerations. 17 Additionally, Mr Nassif's children are referred to under the heading "Primary Considerations" only for the purpose of recording that they are over the age of 18 years (that is, not children whose best interests were a primary consideration).
 It is open for you to find that Joshua would suffer significant emotional hardship should Mr Nassif's visa be cancelled. ' The minute does not advise the Minister that, depending on the nature of the relationship between Mr Nassif and Joshua, this emotional hardship could be a primary consideration.
 Indeed, the Minister is nowhere advised by the minute that she should give consideration to whether the relationship between Mr Nassif and Joshua is a "parental or other close relationship". 20 Having regard to all of the evidence and other material to which the parties drew my attention, I consider it appropriate to draw the inference that the Minister did not give consideration to whether the relationship between Mr Nassif and Joshua was a "parental or other close relationship".
 In doing so I place particular weight on the failure of the Departmental minute to identify the nature of the relationship between Mr Nassif and Joshua as an issue for the Minister's consideration and the failure of the statement of reasons explicitly to address the issue.
