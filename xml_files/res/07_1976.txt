 (Revised judgment) 1 This is an appeal by six Appellants from a decision of Emmett FM delivered on 24 July 2007. 2 Her Honour dismissed an application for constitutional writs in respect of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal on 13 October 2006.
 The Notice of Appeal as filed on 13 August 2007 set the following grounds of appeal: Her Honour prevented me from addressing the court and explaining my circumstances as I have prepared a four page statement in my own language and was not able to do so.
 That statement, it is understood, was the " four page statement " referred to in the Notice of Appeal . 6 In addition a community volunteer, Mr Laba-Sarkis JP, sought the indulgence of the Court to make submissions on the Appellant's behalf.
 Nothing is known as to the qualifications of the interpreter and nothing is known as to the basis upon which it is contended that the interpreter did not properly discharge his functions. 12 The grounds of appeal seeking to allege a denial of procedural fairness in the Federal Magistrates Court are rejected.
