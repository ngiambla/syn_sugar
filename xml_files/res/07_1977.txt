 Mr Boensch claimed that any interest he held in the property was only as trustee for a trust established by him and his former wife for the benefit of their children.
 He advised that he would seek funding from creditors to pursue the investigation and litigation and also an indemnity against any adverse costs orders (for which otherwise Mr Pascoe would be personally liable).
 Mr Pascoe informed creditors that at the meeting he would seek approval of administration costs already incurred ($20,079.50), estimated fees to conduct further investigations, litigation and administration ($30,000) and that further remuneration might need to be approved in the future.
 Mr Boensch responded, in part, on 16 February 2006 by asking for 'reversal' of the notice and saying: 'If I don't receive confirmation I will not only file an objection to this notice but also make an application to have you removed/replaced as my Trustee' .
