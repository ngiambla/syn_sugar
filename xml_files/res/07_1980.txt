 In the statement attached to the application for review the appellant repeated the claims that he made in his application for a protection visa. 10 The Tribunal wrote to the appellant at the Pitt Street address by letter dated 2 November 2004 and provided details of how the appellant's application for review would proceed.
 The Magistrate referred to various sections in the Migration Act and decisions of this Court, including the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 (" SZFDE ").
 The Magistrate took the view that an agent's wrongful conduct, whether fraudulent or not, in failing to inform an applicant of a hearing of the Tribunal of which notification had been given did not give rise to jurisdictional error.
 He said that the outcome of the application for constitutional writs in relation to the decision of the Tribunal did not turn on whether or not the agent's conduct in not informing the appellant of the proposed Tribunal hearing was fraudulent.
