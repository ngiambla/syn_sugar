 The Magistrate referred to various sections in the Migration Act and decisions of this Court, including the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 ; (2006) 154 FCR 365 (" SZFDE ").
 The Magistrate took the view that an agent's wrongful conduct, whether fraudulent or not, in failing to inform an applicant of a hearing of the Tribunal of which notification had been given did not give rise to jurisdictional error.
