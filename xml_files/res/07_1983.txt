 No other specific order of the Court was sought or made in relation to the particular discovery. 15 It is well known that a discovery affidavit is 'conclusive' including on the question of whether a party has or has had in its possession, custody or power any relevant documents other than those discovered ( Mulley v Manifold [1959] HCA 23 ; (1959) 103 CLR 341).
 A party may also seek discovery of specific documents supported by an affidavit when a prima facie case identified can be made out that the other party has or has had certain specific documents or classes of documents that relate to the matter in question. 16 Betts avoided attempting to rely upon a contentious affidavit to challenge the discovery.
 The question then in those circumstances is whether the usual rules as to information and belief in an interlocutory affidavit, give way to specific rules specifying the manner in which a discovery affidavit is to be sworn. 19 Two things might be noted.
