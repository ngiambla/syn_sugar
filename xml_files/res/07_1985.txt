 Introduction 1 The liquidators of Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (Forestview) seek from the Court an extension of the period for obtaining the Court's approval to an agreement which they entered into on behalf of Forestview on 31 August 2007 with First United Developments Pte Ltd (First United) (the Agreement).
 It has prepared a lengthy Deed of Acknowledgement and Release which would require, inter alia, that First United and Forestview release any claim they may have to a contingency amount of $500,000 retained by the receivers and managers against the possibility of litigation threatened against them by Mr Carey.
 The appointment of the expert was to be made within 48 hours of execution of the agreement. 29 Clause 12 of the Agreement provided that First United would pay a once only amount to Forestview of $25,000 upon execution of the Agreement as a non-refundable deposit against the purchase price of the Stage Two Land.
