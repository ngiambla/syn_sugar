 Natural Waters has also marketed Fiji Water as a "celebrity water"; that is, a water consumed by film and television stars in Hollywood. 55 Photographic evidence of Natural Waters' promotional activities emphasise different individual features of the 2003 and 2005 get-ups.
 From about June 2002, Mr Dayal commenced inquiries into appropriate bottle shape, name and label designs and artwork for the Dayals product. 63 Mr Dayal made the decisions for Dayals on the marketing of a bottled water product from Fiji.
 There is no doubt, based upon Mr Dayal's evidence, that he was keenly aware of Fiji Water and its 2003 get-up when he made the decision to produce and distribute a bottled water from Fiji.
