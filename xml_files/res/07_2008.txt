 The reasonableness of this allowance and the reasonableness of the costs and disbursements are dealt with in Mr Thompson's affidavit. 36 The second part of the settlement sum would be directed to an organisation known as Link Market Services ("Link") which manages Telstra's share register.
 In short, it is proposed to pay to Mr Taylor and all members of the group, excluding those who purchased shares on 11 August 2005, 5 or 6 September 2005, or who purchased and sold shares within the period in question, the amount of $3.75 million less the costs and disbursements and administrative expenses to which I have referred above.
 A significant part of the strategy is the requirement, as much as is practicable, that persons seeking to make a claim do so by completing a web-based proof of claim form which will be located on a webpage hosted by Slater Gordon to be found at www.slatergordon.com.au/pages/telstrasettlement.aspx.
 The scheme provides for Slater Gordon to request supporting documentation and to determine whether the persons are eligible to participate. 47 Under the scheme, Slater Gordon are authorised to add to the confirmed transaction schedules those unrecorded transactions that the firm satisfies itself to be in respect of purchases of eligible shares.
