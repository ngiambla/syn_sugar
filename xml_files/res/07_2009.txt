 BUCHANAN J: 1 This is an application for leave to appeal against orders made by Allsop J on 9 October 2007 which accompanied a judgment given on that day ( Aristocrat Technologies Australia Limited v IGT (Australia) Pty Limited [2007] FCA 1540).
 In that judgment his Honour found certain claims in a patent application made by the applicants (Australian Patent Application Number 748263) to be not novel in the light of another patent called the Bennett Patent (Australian Patent Number 633469).
 His Honour found that the patent application could not proceed to grant insofar as it contained the claims he found not to be novel. 2 The applicants seek leave to appeal for the purpose of challenging his Honour's finding that the Bennett Patent deprived the relevant claims of novelty.
