 There is no purpose now in Mr Jasper giving such evidence. 42 Hawthorn Glen submitted that the 14 February 2007 Board paper prepared by Mr Jasper evidenced an intention by Aconex that Hawthorn Glen as a shareholder be given by the offer documents an offer open for acceptance until 30 April 2007 contrary to paragraphs 78 and 79 of Mr Phillpot's affidavit.
 Mr Jasper was on notice that this submission would be put by Hawthorn Glen and in that respect the rule in Browne v Dunn was complied with. 43 Hawthorn Glen submitted that Mr Jasper's evidence in his second affidavit sworn 9 October 2007 was virtually identical to the evidence given in Mr Phillpot's second affidavit.
 Rather they overlooked, and did not take into account sufficiently, the issue of intention and the documents referred to by Hawthorn Glen in its final address; (d) The defendants had the opportunity to seek leave to call further evidence, of the type the subject of their present application, well before the time at which judgment was reserved.
 The defendants had a choice open to them: (a) Apply to the Court before final addresses commenced for leave to call further evidence in response to the matters raised in Hawthorn Glen's final written submissions; or (b) Make a submission in the course of final addresses that the rule in Browne v Dunn had not been observed or complied with by counsel for Hawthorn Glen and that certain consequences should follow.
