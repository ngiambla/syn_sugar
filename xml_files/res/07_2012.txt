 It is not clearly stated in the Bankruptcy Act or the Assets Recovery Act whether a restraining order under the Assets Recovery Act, such as the Supreme Court order, operates as "stay" of a judgment for the purposes of the issue of a valid bankruptcy notice under the Bankruptcy Act . 7 Federal Magistrate Smith, for reasons to which I will refer, was satisfied that it was appropriate to make the sequestration order (at [36]).
 The question before his Honour was whether an order pursuant to s 18 of the Commonwealth Act effectively stays execution on an outstanding judgment against the party subject to that order for the purposes of ss 40(1)(g) and 41(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act (at [1]).
 Section 10 of the Assets Recovery Act 18 Mr Ollis contends that s 10 of the Assets Recovery Act, which provides for a restraining order, does not provide for a right on the part of the owner of the property to make an application in respect of it.
 He submits that an ancillary order requires the continued existence of the Supreme Court order in the terms in which it was made. 23 Such a submission is contrary to s 12(1), which specifically provides for an application to vary the interests in property.
