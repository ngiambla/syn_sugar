 The contraventions were the demand for payment and the coercive behaviour. 27 In Caelli (FC) , Jessup J considered that it was relevant that the definition of industrial action excluded action based on a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to the health or safety of the worker.
 His Honour held that by establishing those limitations the legislature must be taken to have turned its mind 'to the question of where the line should be drawn between permissible, and impermissible, health and safety related stoppages': at [142].
 The conduct of the fourth and fifth respondents was deliberate in the sense that they intended to make the claims for payment and participated in the stoppages in order to force Multiplex to pay the moneys sought.
 Although technically the Union was penalised for the industrial action taken on 25 and 26 August 2003 in the Caelli case, the circumstances which gave rise to that industrial action were the same circumstances as gave rise to the contraventions in the present case.
