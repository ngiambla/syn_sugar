 It was contended that the Magistrate should have found that there was a separate contractual undertaking, comprised or evidenced by a letter of 25 March 2002 from Beaumonde, to indemnify Mr Roger Gaunt completely. 6 Atrium cross-appealed against the decision of the Magistrate to award Atrium damages in the sum of $15,450.
 The Magistrate referred to the case of Ladbroke (Football) v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273 at 289 and concluded that, by reason of the original work undertaken by Atrium in relation to the Atrium Gaunt plans, it had copyright in those plans.
 The Atrium Gaunt plans were created and transferred into the possession of Mr Richard Gaunt as agent for Mr Roger Gaunt, pursuant to a business model founded on an expectation that, the plans would be used by Mr Roger Gaunt as part of a further contractual arrangement, which would include the consideration for the use of the plans.
 Whether Mr Hille was a copyright owner 93 Mr Roger Gaunt, in grounds 9 and 10 of his notice of appeal, contended that the Magistrate erred in determining that there had been an infringement of Mr Hille's copyright by the copying of the Atrium Gaunt plans because Mr Hille was not the author of the Atrium Gaunt plans.
