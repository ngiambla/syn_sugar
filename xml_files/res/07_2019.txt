 That information is housed by CGL on a combined computer software and operating system package called the "RAC System" (the RAC database). 35 Mr Porteous explained that the addresses entered on the RAC database for policyholders were often incomplete or were not entered at all.
 Of the 163 listed CGL reinsurers, Mr Porteous was able to find a current address for 104 of them, unable to locate a current address in the case of 32 of them, and the remaining 27 of them were reinsurers who were underwriting syndicates forming part of Lloyds of London, each of which syndicates had ceased operations, had closed and no longer existed.
 The first group was marked "OK", the second group "NA", and the third group "LL" on the Outward Reinsurance Spreadsheet. 46 Mr Porteous also searched the RAC database and obtained details of the reinsurance brokers who were responsible for the placement and administration of all contracts of reinsurance entered into by CGL.
