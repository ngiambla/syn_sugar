 In those proceedings it sought preliminary discovery in order to determine whether it had any cause of action against any person and, if so what person, in relation to the use of its confidential report. 3 On 7 September 2006 I made orders for preliminary discovery against each of the respondents.
 By that motion it sought additional preliminary discovery, an order for forensic examination of, inter alia, electronic databases held by the Incat group, preservation orders with respect to discovered documents and the examination of some ten persons before a Registrar of the Court. 7 The motion came on for hearing on 9 November 2006.
 The time for Austal to commence proceedings was extended to 16 February 2007 and will be further extended. 8 Austal subsequently filed a substituted minute of proposed orders which reflected in its abandonment of the orders for further discovery and forensic examination of the electronic databases held by the Incat Group.
 The Merrigan email predated the alleged disclosure of the Report by Mr Thurlow in May 2006. 16 What Messrs Clifford and Carter did with the Reports after they came into their hands may be relevant to the question whether Incat Tasmania, of which both are officers, is a party to an infringing reproduction, assuming copyright to subsist in favour of Austal.
