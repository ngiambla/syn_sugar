 1 On 12 December 2007, pursuant to s 29(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (the Act), I ordered that the Court request the Royal Court of Jersey to act in aid of, and be auxiliary to, this Court in matters of bankruptcy concerning the bankrupt estate of the late Rene Walter Rivkin in the respects set out in the order.
 The application for the order had been made by the wife and one of the sons of the deceased pursuant to s 247 of the Act acting as persons administering the estate of the deceased.
