 Mr Ruaro also said that he would have come back to the Rose Bay mooring after having Seaquest slipped in 2000, whether or not he had had the conversation with Mr Holmes at that time.
 I do not consider, on a fair reading of the exchange between Mr Ruaro and Mr Holmes in 1996, which is set out above (see paragraph [6]), that the exchange constituted the representation alleged.
 Mr Britton was asked to express his opinion as to whether mooring number 60 was, on 24 August 2003, reasonably adequate for a vessel of the dimensions, displacement, weight and design of Pavana.
