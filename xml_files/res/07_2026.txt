 The Commission has had produced to it and has taken possession of documents that are prima facie subject to legal professional privilege of one or other of the applicants. 23 The Commission did not at any relevant time have any written or other documented policy in place in relation to the question of how the Commission would deal with, or treat, legal professional privilege in the event that documents were produced to it containing communications that were subject to legal professional privilege or if claims were made by the recipient of a notice in relation to legal professional privilege.
 Thus, they say, they should have been notified of the fact of the issue of a notice to a recipient where that recipient might be in possession of documents that were subject to the privilege. 29 Alternatively, the applicants say that, by reason of the subject matter, scope and purposes of the Act, the right to claim legal professional privilege was a factor that the relevant Examiner was bound to take into account.
 Finally, it also follows that each recipient of a notice was entitled to communicate with the applicants in order to clarify the existence or otherwise of legal professional privilege of the applicants in documents in the possession of the recipient and to ascertain whether the applicants wished to claim privilege. 32 However, while legal professional privilege is not abrogated by the Act, as a matter of pragmatic practicality, the holder of the privilege may not be in a position, himself, herself or itself, to claim or assert the privilege in relation to the production of documents pursuant to a notice under s 29 if that holder of the privilege is not aware of the existence of the notice.
