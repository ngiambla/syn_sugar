 REASONS The First Ground of Appeal 11 In my opinion, the learned Federal Magistrate correctly held that it was for the applicant to establish her case before the Tribunal: Minister for Immigration Ethnic Affairs v Guo [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 596.
 The applicant was invited by the learned Federal Magistrate to provide details in support of that ground but she did not do so. 12 It is no part of the duty of the decision-maker to make the applicant's case for him: Prasad v Minister for Immigration Ethnic Affairs (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-170.
