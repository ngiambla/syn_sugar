 Had the employees been aware of this and the misstatement made to them by Mr James Sutton, they would not have entered into the AWAs. 3 The employees were not provided with the AWAs for the seven day period prescribed by s 337(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ("the Act ").
 The AWAs provided for a less generous entitlement for each year of service and the amount payable was capped at 12 weeks. 6 The applicant is a Workplace Inspector appointed under s 167(2) of the Act .
 I raised with the parties the prospect of paying part of the total penalty sum to each of the employees such as to make good, in each case, the shortfall in their redundancy payments, that shortfall being calculated by deducting from each employee's redundancy entitlement under the certified agreement the amount to be paid to him by the liquidator by way of redundancy entitlements under the AWAs both figures calculated on a pro-rata basis by reference to the sum available to the liquidator for distribution.
