 Further telephone conversations took place on 19 and 27 September 2007 and 30 November 2007. 10 It is clear that Mr Yeo is aware of these proceedings and of the fact that the ACCC wishes to seek to join him as a respondent.
 He also told the ACCC in an earlier telephone conversation that it was his intention to come back to Australia "in the near future". 12 As appeared from the initial conversation with Mr Yeo in 2006, Mr Yeo was instrumental in establishing the business of Study Overseas Now in Western Australia.
 In that event the Court may order such steps be taken as are specified in its order for the purpose of bringing the document to the notice of the person to be served. 17 The threshold condition upon the exercise of the power to order substituted service is that set out in O 7, r 9 namely that "for any reason it is impractical to serve a document in the manner set out in the Rules".
 There is also a deemed service of originating process where the respondent files an appearance or defence or appears in court. 18 There is authority for the proposition that an order for substituted service cannot be made in respect of a party outside the jurisdiction where leave has not been granted to serve that party out of the jurisdiction.
