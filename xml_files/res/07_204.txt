 The appellant's case centred on the claim that his father was an active member of the Bharatiya Janata Party ("BJP"), and, because the appellant was the eldest son of his father, he feared that his political opponents, especially the Congress Party workers, believed that he may seek a political position as his father had done.
 The final ground alleged that the Tribunal misapplied the law by making adverse findings as to the availability of protection, because the decision was based on the appellant's ability to avoid the feared persecution, and because the findings were not based on evidence. 5 The Federal Magistrate accepted that the first ground had been made out but not for the reasons advanced by the appellant.
 Notwithstanding the failure of the Tribunal to observe the requirements of s 424A of the Act there existed a separate and independent basis for the decision to which the Tribunal came: see SZCJH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1660 at [23] ; SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 at [232] --- [233].
