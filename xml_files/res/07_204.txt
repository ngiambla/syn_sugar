 1 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate, delivered on 14 December 2006, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") given on 28 January 2005 and handed down on 17 February 2005: see [2006] FMCA 1833.
 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant. 2 The appellant is a citizen of India.
 The appellant's case centred on the claim that his father was an active member of the Bharatiya Janata Party ("BJP"), and, because the appellant was the eldest son of his father, he feared that his political opponents, especially the Congress Party workers, believed that he may seek a political position as his father had done.
