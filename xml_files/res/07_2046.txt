 DENIAL OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS 4 The Applicant contends that the Tribunal used a number of " publications " in a manner which has denied him procedural fairness. 5 There are a number of answers to this ground of appeal.
 In those paragraphs of the Tribunal decision in Re Howard , there is reference to two further decisions of the Tribunal, namely, Re Sorensen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] AATA 96 at [29] , and Re Azar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] AATA 1061 at [37] .
 A statement by the Tribunal, that it had given the letter no weight, did not absolve it of the necessity to disclose the substance of the letter to enable submissions to be made. 12 In the present proceedings, the " evidence " referred to in the earlier decision of the Tribunal was not evidence personal to the present Applicant.
 The issues arising from having available to the Tribunal such expertise and knowledge has to some extent been discussed by Katzen in 'Procedural Fairness and Specialist Members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal' (1995) 2 Australian Journal of Administrative Law 169.
