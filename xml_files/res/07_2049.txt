 The respondent has invited the Court to dismiss the proceeding, not simply for non-appearance by the applicant, but pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), on the ground that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. 2 In form, the proceeding is an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal").
 The substantive letter notified the applicant that the respondent would argue at this directions hearing that the proceeding should be struck out, on the basis that it relates to an intermediate decision and not a final decision of the Tribunal. 5 The nature of the decision that the Tribunal is said to have made can be discerned in part from the notice of appeal itself.
 It follows that, to the extent to which the notice of appeal seeks to rely on the proposition that the Tribunal lacked power to adjourn the proceeding, and lacked power to obtain by summons information from the accountants, the appeal would have to fail. 13 There are perhaps greater difficulties in relation to the questions of bias and discrimination.
