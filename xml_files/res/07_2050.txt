 On 20 April 2007, a Federal Magistrate made an order dismissing the appellant's application for constitutional writs under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal").
 The Tribunal member said that communal riots in Nigeria were well-documented by local and international press agencies and by human rights groups and that although there was evidence of communal riots in Kano in October 2001 and again in May 2004, there was no evidence of communal riots in 2002. 10 The Tribunal member found that the appellant had remained in his employed position at his college in Kano throughout 2002 and that he put in his notice "in an orderly fashion" and then left Kano.
 The Federal Magistrate's reasons 15 It seems from the Federal Magistrate's reasons that it was argued before him that the Tribunal had failed to consider a claim that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution by Jihadists who would pursue those persons who had converted from Islam to Christianity.
 However, he said that in relation to the submission that the Tribunal had failed to consider the individual personal circumstances of the appellant and in particular his psychiatric condition, that was not an issue which was squarely raised by the appellant.
