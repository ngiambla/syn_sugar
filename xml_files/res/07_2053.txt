 Mr Singh, a member of BCR's board, gave affidavit evidence that at the meeting 'all points raised by [ACMA] were covered by us, all questions answered'. 15 On 18 May 2007, BCR forwarded to ACMA a 38 page submission, to which supporting documentation was attached.
 But there is nothing irrational or illogical in an administrative decision-making body with responsibility for allocating and renewing broadcasting licences using its own knowledge or understanding of community broadcasting to assess the representativeness of a particular organisation made up partly of outsiders.
 Mr Singh's evidence was that at the meeting all points raised by ACMA had been covered by BCR and all questions answered. 47 Thirdly, it is by no means obvious that any of BCR's board members in fact misinterpreted ACMA's comments.
