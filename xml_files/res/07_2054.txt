 Mr Perlinski exhibited a copy of "the template or pro forma written licence agreement Dais enters into with each of its clients by way of licensing arrangements. " This agreement is drafted very favourably for Dais, and contains wide and tight requirements as to confidentiality.
 Mr Muys said that he had, without prompting or assistance from anyone, accessed and downloaded the table file and the editor file from the HR Advantage site simply by directing his browser to the following addresses: www.hradvantage.com.au/_script/CDAITable.js and www.hradvantage.com.au/_script/CDAIEditor.js.
 THE CORPORATIONS ACT CLAIM 100 Dais contends that, when Mr Petro downloaded the source code for the table file and the editor file in about June 2004 and subsequently used that information, he contravened s 183(1) of the Corporations Act .
