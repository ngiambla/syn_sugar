 In practice, this may involve the parties adducing evidence from expert costs assessors addressing whether the costs claimed by the successful party were ' necessary or proper for the attainment of justice or for maintaining or defending the rights of a party ' (O 62 r 19) or, in more general terms, whether the amounts sought would have been recoverable on a taxation of costs. 30 Care should be taken, however, to ensure that the process does not take on too many of the characteristics of a taxation of costs.
 It is no disrespect to them to observe that by reason of my own involvement in the proceedings, I am in a better position than they to assess whether certain kinds of work undertaken, or expenditure incurred, by Telstra's solicitors were necessary or proper for Telstra's defence.
 However, in assessing this commitment of resources it is necessary to bear in mind the nature and complexity of the case, the vast amount of documentation, the issues of fact and law peculiar to Telstra (including some ultimately not pressed by Seven) and the need for continuity of representation.
