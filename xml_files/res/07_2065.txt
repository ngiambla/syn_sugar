 Simply because it may be difficult to ascertain the finer detail of those pleadings and assess with accuracy the likelihood of success does not mean the prospects of success in the litigation should be amplified for the prospective applicant through the effects of an invasive order for preliminary discovery.
 The first is that Optiver has crossed the threshold of "a bare pleadable case", and therefore does not satisfy O 15A r 6(b). 31 The information which Optiver has at present --- in particular, the termination or resignation of the fifth to ninth respondents, their subsequent establishment of Tibra, the discovery of two emails by Mr Keldoulis, and Mr Shale's calculations --- sufficiently equips it to decide whether to commence proceedings.
 While it is true that a strict confidentiality regime could be instituted, this would almost certainly introduce an undesirable degree of complexity, delay and cost which the evidence presently before me does not warrant. 37 I am not satisfied that information of such sensitivity to Tibra should be disclosed at this early stage.
