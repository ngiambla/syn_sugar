 The substance of the proceeding is that the applicant says the complaints that he made to the Commission arising out of his detention and involving a number of persons required investigation and remedy, but that the Commission did not properly carry out its function under its statute to investigate those complaints but rather terminated them without a proper basis.
 However, it should be done on terms that the applicant is not prejudiced as to costs and I, or whoever is managing this case, will ensure that that is honoured. 4 Secondly, there is a difficulty occasioned by the fact that there is a guardianship order in force in relation to the affairs of this applicant in the New South Wales jurisdiction.
 I do not pretend to have understood the full ramifications of that but it makes it desirable, in my opinion, that special liberty be reserved to the applicant to revoke this order once the position in relation to guardianship is resolved.
