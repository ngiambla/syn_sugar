 His Honour found both that there was an absence of the necessary jurisdictional fact on the basis that the magistrate's view was arbitrary and capricious, and that there was an absence of procedural fairness afforded as a matter of fact and law.
 His Honour held that the denial of procedural fairness was not cured by the s 21 review as held by the primary Judge but preferred not to decide the question whether failure to satisfy s 19(1)(d) of itself required quashing the orders of the magistrate.
 How failure to accord procedural fairness comes within the rubric of a s 21 review was not explained (cf Hill J in Republic of South Africa v Dutton (1997) 77 FCR 128 at 136D, noticed by Conti J in Knauder [2002] FCAFC 404 ; 127 FCR 327 at [36] ). 7 The question was discussed by Black CJ in Brock [2007] FCAFC 3 ; 157 FCR 121, particularly at [28] and [30].
