 On 8 November 2007 Rares J made declarations and orders, the effect of which was to declare invalid and quash successive notices purporting to have been given pursuant to s 16 ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 3) [2007] FCA 1898).
 His Honour found both that there was an absence of the necessary jurisdictional fact on the basis that the magistrate's view was arbitrary and capricious, and that there was an absence of procedural fairness afforded as a matter of fact and law.
 How failure to accord procedural fairness comes within the rubric of a s 21 review was not explained (cf Hill J in Republic of South Africa v Dutton (1997) 77 FCR 128 at 136D, noticed by Conti J in Knauder [2002] FCAFC 404 ; 127 FCR 327 at [36] ). 7 The question was discussed by Black CJ in Brock [2007] FCAFC 3 ; 157 FCR 121, particularly at [28] and [30].
