 Notice of that hearing had not been personally served, as Order 19, r 4 would have required, if not dispensed with. 17 To similar effect, Kiefel J's analysis of the effect of Order 35A, at first instance, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 at [46], appears to assume implicitly that notice of the default judgment proceedings is not necessary unless the relief ultimately being sought is different to that expressed in the statement of claim.
 This could be overcome by a statement, preceding the declarations, that orders are made 'upon admissions which [the respondent in question] is taken to have made, consequent upon non-compliance with orders of the court'. 22 To similar effect is the judgment of Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815 , which was, like Dataline , a case where judgment was given on the basis of deemed admissions under O 35A.
 Having noted the historical reluctance to base declarations on admissions, his Honour went on to approve and adopt the statements of Kiefel J in Dataline and to exercise his discretion to make declarations on the basis of those deemed admissions, at [13]-[16]. 23 Accordingly I propose to make the declarations sought, predicated by a statement that they are made on the basis of deemed admissions.
