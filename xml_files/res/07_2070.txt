 COMPULSORY ACQUISITION PROCESS 6 On 1 August 2006, Mitsui informed Sempurna and Hanwha that it would exercise its right under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act ") to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares of SAH held by Sempurna and Hanwha. 7 On 19 January 2007, PKF Corporate Advisory Services (NSW) Pty Ltd provided Mitsui with its independent expert report.
 The Expression "Cash Sum" 28 The expression "cash sum" is not defined in the Act . 29 The following sections of chapter 6A of the Act are relevant to the construction of "cash sum" (italics added) 664B(1) [ Terms of Payment ] The 90% holder may acquire the securities in the class for a cash sum only and, subject to sub-section (2), must pay the same amount for each security in the class acquired. 664C(1) [ Compulsory acquisition notice ] To compulsorily acquire securities under section 664A , the 90% holder must prepare a notice in the prescribed form that: (a) sets out the cash sum for which the 90% holder proposes to acquire the securities; ... 664F(3) [ Obligation to approve acquisition ] If the 90% holder establishes that the terms set out in the compulsory acquisition notice give a fair value for the securities, the Court must approve the acquisition of the securities on those terms.
 Likewise the recipient of a notice of compulsory acquisition ought be able to calculate the definite cash sum in order, importantly, to decide whether or not to object. 62 A formula or mechanism which is incapable of ascertaining a precise dollar amount for each of the shares in question at or about the date of a notice of compulsory acquisition does not, in my opinion, constitute a "cash sum", within the meaning of s 664C(1)(a) of the Act. 63 It is not sufficient that at some indeterminate date in the future, if at all, a determinate amount of money may be calculated as the "cash sum" for the purpose of the Notice.
