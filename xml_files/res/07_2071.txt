 ACTION WAD 63 OF 2007 11 In a separate proceeding, WAD 63 of 2007, Mitsui applied, given the objections, for approval under s 664F of the Act , of its compulsory acquisition of the ordinary and A class shares in SAH held by Hanwha and Sempurna. 12 By Orders in that proceeding dated 11 April 2007, Nicholson J, under para 2, ordered, relevantly, that Hanwha be entitled to file a statement listing the grounds of and reasons for its objection to the compulsory acquisition of its shares in SAH by Mitsui. 13 Hanwha filed such a statement dated 4 May 2007 entitled "Hanwha's statement pursuant to paragraph 2 of the orders made by Nicholson J on 11 April 2007" (Hanwha's Statement).
 THE PRELIMINARY ISSUE 18 The Cash Sum Objection was, in its effect, an issue whether on the proper construction and application of s 664C(1)(a) of the Act , the Notice sets out a 'cash sum' when it specifies a sum that is subject to the specified adjustments set out under para [9] above. 19 The preliminary issue has been determined, in effect upholding the Cash Sum Objection ( Mitsui Co Ltd v Hanwha (HK) Co Ltd [2007] FCA 2070).
 The legitimate interests of minorities therefore need to be recognised and protected; [1.12] The regulatory objective was to balance the interests of all shareholders, to avoid either minority oppression or minority dictation;' [1.13] 26 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporate Law Economic Reform Bill (CLERP) 1998, contains the following: 'The Bill will extend the current legislative mechanisms for the compulsory acquisition of securities.
 The Committee recommended that s 664A be amended so that a compulsory acquisition can only occur within 6 months of the proclamation of the legislation or within 6 months of the person seeking to make the acquisition becoming a 90% shareholder (emphasis added). 3.11 The modification is to allow a longer period of 12 months from the proclamation of the legislation for an existing 90% holder to utilise the new compulsory acquisition power.
 By operation of s 664AA(b) of the Act , Mitsui had until 31 January 2007 to lodge compulsory acquisition notices with ASIC concerning Hanwha and Sempurna's ordinary (and A class) shares in SAH. 86 In August 2006 Mitsui decided to seek to compulsorily acquire the remaining ordinary (and A class) shares in SAH held by Hanwha and Sempurna. 87 On or about 15 September 2006 Mitsui engaged PKF to prepare the independent expert's report to accompany the Notices. 88 From August 2006 to January 2007 Mitsui sought to obtain, and obtained, an independent expert's report . 89 In September 2006 Mitsui first prepared notices to give to Hanwha and Sempurna.
 However, Mitsui could not settle the notices until receipt of PKF's independent expert's report. 90 On 19 January 2007 PKF issued to Mitsui its final independent expert's report, in which it concluded that Mitsui was a 90% holder of the ordinary and A class shares in SAH under s 664A(2)(c) of the Act , and that Mitsui's offer to Hanwha and Sempurna under the notices for their ordinary and A class shares in SAH gave a fair value. 91 Mitsui prepared the notices so that the value offered to Hanwha and Sempurna for their ordinary and A class shares in SAH mirrored the price to be paid by Mitsui to Akzo under the Sale Agreement for Akzo's ordinary and A class shares in SAH. 92 On 25 January 2007 Mitsui lodged with ASIC and dispatched to Hanwha and Sempurna compulsory acquisition notices concerning the ordinary and A class shares in SAH held by Hanwha and Sempurna.
 Such application was lodged with ASIC on 23 April 2007. 96 On 11 April 2007 the Court made orders concerning objections to be made by Hanwha and Sempurna. 97 On 4 May 2007 Hanwha provided reasons for its grounds of objections in "Hanwha's Statement Pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Orders made by Nicholson J on 11 April 2007", filed in Action No.
 The plaintiff took no steps to attempt to remedy the invalidity of its compulsory acquisition notice for 8 months, until it launched these proceedings on 23 October 2005; (b) even if the plaintiff and its legal representatives did not understand on 23 February 2007 the objection that was being taken by the defendant in relation to the "cash sum" issue, which is unlikely, that objection was spelt out in detail in the defendant's statement, dated 4 May 2007, pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Orders made by Nicholson J on 11 April 2007.
 Mr Matsuyama expressed the position in his second affidavit, dated 9 October 2007, in the following terms: "From 23 April 2007 until 12 September 2007 Mitsui waited for ASIC's determination of the First ASIC Application" (e) on 28 April 2007, one of the adjustments, to which the price offered in the compulsory acquisition notice was subject, namely, the Cyclone Insurance Payment component of the Cyclone Adjustment, was determined.
 The defendant first learnt of the determination, fortuitously, on about 12 September 2007, on receipt of the plaintiff's Second ASIC Application, in which the fact of the determination (not the amount) was disclosed because it was in the interests of the plaintiff to do so; (f) on 25 May 2007, a further adjustment, to which the price offered in the compulsory acquisition notice was subject, namely, the Completion Account Adjustment, was finally determined.
 I consider that during the period between when Mitsui acquired its interest in SAH on 31 July 2006, and when it filed its application with ASIC on 12 September 2007, Mitsui sought at each stage to advance the resolution of the compulsory acquisition process. 113 I accept the submissions of Mitsui in this respect, which are reflected below. 114 The plaintiff was active through until 23 April 2007, its activity on that date being an application to ASIC for comfort relief, pursuant to s 669.
 On 4 September 2007, approximately 4 months from that date, the plaintiff filed a second application to ASIC for relief pursuant to s 669 in relation to, among other things, the "cash sum" requirement in the notices of compulsory acquisition. 115 The plaintiff awaited ASIC's determination of the 23 April 2007 application, which was sought to resolve uncertainties arising from Hanwha not accepting service.
