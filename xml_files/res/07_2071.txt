 These were intended to emphasise that, in part, the policy considerations and legislative objective were to remove the potential of minority shareholders from demanding a price for their securities that is above fair value, a practice commonly described as 'greenmailing': Capricorn Diamonds Investments Pty Ltd v Catto [2002] VSC 105 ; (2002) 5 VR 61 at [28] cited with approval by Steytler P in Batoka Pty Ltd v Conocophillips WA-248 Pty Ltd [2006] WASCA 44 at [40] .
 However, Mitsui could not settle the notices until receipt of PKF's independent expert's report. 90 On 19 January 2007 PKF issued to Mitsui its final independent expert's report, in which it concluded that Mitsui was a 90% holder of the ordinary and A class shares in SAH under s 664A(2)(c) of the Act , and that Mitsui's offer to Hanwha and Sempurna under the notices for their ordinary and A class shares in SAH gave a fair value. 91 Mitsui prepared the notices so that the value offered to Hanwha and Sempurna for their ordinary and A class shares in SAH mirrored the price to be paid by Mitsui to Akzo under the Sale Agreement for Akzo's ordinary and A class shares in SAH. 92 On 25 January 2007 Mitsui lodged with ASIC and dispatched to Hanwha and Sempurna compulsory acquisition notices concerning the ordinary and A class shares in SAH held by Hanwha and Sempurna.
 Mr Matsuyama expressed the position in his second affidavit, dated 9 October 2007, in the following terms: "From 23 April 2007 until 12 September 2007 Mitsui waited for ASIC's determination of the First ASIC Application" (e) on 28 April 2007, one of the adjustments, to which the price offered in the compulsory acquisition notice was subject, namely, the Cyclone Insurance Payment component of the Cyclone Adjustment, was determined.
 The defendant first learnt of the determination, fortuitously, on about 12 September 2007, on receipt of the plaintiff's Second ASIC Application, in which the fact of the determination (not the amount) was disclosed because it was in the interests of the plaintiff to do so; (f) on 25 May 2007, a further adjustment, to which the price offered in the compulsory acquisition notice was subject, namely, the Completion Account Adjustment, was finally determined.
