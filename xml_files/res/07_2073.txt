 BJT Legal acknowledged receipt of the Notice by facsimile dated 24 October 2006. 10 On 26 October 2006, the Court in VID 884 of 2006 ordered that A Chaid be wound up and appointed Sellers as liquidator. 11 On or about 9 November 2006, the Commissioner lodged a proof of debt with the liquidator in the amount of $244,866.96.
 I reject that submission. 36 As the liquidator notes, the relevant law on this point is helpfully summarized in the reasons of Dutney JA (with whom Williams and Jerrard JJA agreed) in Surfers Paradise Investments Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Davoren Nominees Pty Ltd [2004] 1 Qd R 567 (" Surfers Paradise" ).
