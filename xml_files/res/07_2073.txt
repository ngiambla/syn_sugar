 BJT Legal acknowledged receipt of the Notice by facsimile dated 24 October 2006. 10 On 26 October 2006, the Court in VID 884 of 2006 ordered that A Chaid be wound up and appointed Sellers as liquidator. 11 On or about 9 November 2006, the Commissioner lodged a proof of debt with the liquidator in the amount of $244,866.96.
 As Emmett J said, " [t]here is no doubt that the effect of winding up and of sequestration is that there is a restriction imposed on the capacity of a creditor to enforce payment of a debt without the leave of the Court . " However, s 468(2)(a) provides that a disposition by the liquidator is exempt if made pursuant to a power conferred on him by the Corporations Act .
 I reject that submission. 36 As the liquidator notes, the relevant law on this point is helpfully summarized in the reasons of Dutney JA (with whom Williams and Jerrard JJA agreed) in Surfers Paradise Investments Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Davoren Nominees Pty Ltd [2004] 1 Qd R 567 (" Surfers Paradise" ).
