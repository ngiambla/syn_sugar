 The assets of the Company, at present, are less than $20,000, although the Administrator's report indicates that, in the last 12 months, substantial assets of the Company were transferred to its director in exchange for a payment of $800,000, although the details of the payment are not explained.
 On the material that is presently available, I would not be satisfied that it is in the interests of the Company's creditors for the Company to continue under administration rather than be wound up.
