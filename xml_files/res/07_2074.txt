 The Commissioner criticises the proposal on the basis that there is no reliable evidence as to the financial position of the director, his wife or the related company, to indicate that they would be in a position to meet any claim on any such guarantee.
 The assets of the Company, at present, are less than $20,000, although the Administrator's report indicates that, in the last 12 months, substantial assets of the Company were transferred to its director in exchange for a payment of $800,000, although the details of the payment are not explained.
 On the material that is presently available, I would not be satisfied that it is in the interests of the Company's creditors for the Company to continue under administration rather than be wound up.
