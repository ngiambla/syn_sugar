 The Full Court refused the application of the applicant (Cadbury) for a new trial and remitted the matter to me as the trial judge for the purpose of receiving the wrongly rejected evidence and relevant opposing evidence on behalf of the respondent (Darrell Lea).
 Survey 5 As the Full Court made clear in a second judgment when the matter was brought back on Cadbury's application ( Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCAFC 102) there is not to be a new trial of this matter enabling Cadbury to call any evidence and ask any questions which it now thinks would be helpful.
 That may have the consequence that Darrell Lea would seek to adduce its own evidence in response to the disputed evidence. [8] We indicated in our reasons (at [110]) that, if proper objections were taken to the disputed evidence at the further hearing and the evidence was rejected, it would be open to the primary judge to allow Cadbury to elicit further evidence to overcome the objections .
