 On the same day, the Customs CEO extended the period until 22 October 2007. 16 On 22 October 2007, Chanel commenced the present proceedings against the respondent, seeking remedies for infringement of its trade mark. 17 On 4 December 2007, a representative of Customs informed Chanel's solicitors that the time had expired for Chanel to seek a court order restraining the Customs CEO from releasing the goods to the respondent.
 This obligation, however, only arises if: 'after 20 working days from the day on which the action was brought, there is not in force at any time an order of the Court ...' (Emphasis added. ) 27 There seems to be an internal inconsistency, or at least infelicity, in the language of s 137(5).
 Yet, as I have pointed out, if the Court has power to make an order after the expiration of the 20 day period, the utility of any such order seems to depend upon the Customs CEO not having complied with his or her statutory duty to release the goods in a timely fashion.
