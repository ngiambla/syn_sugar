 Rosalind gave evidence that general discussion occurred about a readjustment of family assets and that Mr McKenzie addressed that topic, possibly in the context of his letter of 10 November 2000.
 The letter was headed: "D L and D Mackinnon family rearrangement". 40 The letter commenced as follows: Further to meetings with the family last weekend, I now enclose a draft document detailing the terms of the proposed rearrangement which has now been agreed by the family members.
 There has been unnecessary delay in registering Rosalind as a member of the companies and there is no apparent injustice to third parties if such an order were made: see, In re Sussex Brick Company [1904] 1 Ch 598.
 Rosalind was entitled to be recognised as a member of Rocklands Pty Ltd from at least 1 July 2005 on the payment of the price of those B Class shares and of shares in Dalness Pty Ltd from the time of the grant of probate on her father's estate on 21 June 2004.
