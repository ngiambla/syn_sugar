 These reasons incorporate the consideration that I gave to the issue. 6 On 4 December 2007, the Scheme Meeting was held and the members agreed to the Scheme by the required statutory majorities. 7 On 10 December 2007, at the second court hearing (which had been adjourned part heard on 5 December 2007), I made orders under s 411(4)(b) of the Act approving the Scheme. 8 The evidence before the Court on the second court hearing included that which had previously been before the Court.
 Although the Court did not scrutinize the naked no vote fee in its opinion, it did observe (at 1023): [T]he bottom line is that the public stockholders will have an opportunity tomorrow to reject the merger if they do not think the price is high enough in light of the Company's stand-alone value and other options.
 In sum, the break fee payable by Coeur is payable in comparable circumstances to those in which the Bolnisi break fee is payable: a failure by Coeur's shareholders to pass a resolution that its directors would wish them to pass in order that the Scheme be implemented. 38 I accept that if Bolnisi's directors had not agreed to the Bolnisi naked no vote break fee provision, Coeur's directors would not have agreed that Coeur should accept a liability to pay Bolnisi a break fee if the Coeur shareholders failed to pass a resolution increasing the number of Coeur's authorised shares.
