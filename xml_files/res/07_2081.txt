 1 When I published my reasons in Fadu Pty Ltd v ACN 008 112 196 Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1965 , I directed that the parties file and serve draft minutes of order to give effect to my findings and reasons and to make submissions on costs.
 The differences between them that were evidenced in the hearing subsist still. 2 As to the orders to be made, I should indicate that I intend to dismiss the Amended Application (which sought relief in respect of restraints of trade at common law) for the reason that, by virtue of s 4M of the Trade Practices Act 1976 (Cth), the law relating to restraint of trade at common law was, in the circumstances, not capable of operating concurrently with s 87(3) of the TP Act, which was invoked by the first, fourth, seventh and eighth respondents ("the respondents") in their cross-claim of 2007.
 The Restraint Givers jointly and severally covenant that they will not (and that they will procure that their related entities do not): 2.1 Conduct, or be involved, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of, a laundry hire business; 2.2 ... in any part of the area within the boundary line marked out in Appendix 'B' in the reasons for judgment published in this proceedings on 11 December 2007 for a period of three years after the Completion Date (as that term is defined in the Heads of Agreement). " 4 On the issue of costs, the applicants seek that the respondents pay their costs of the proceedings.
