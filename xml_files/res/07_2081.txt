 1 When I published my reasons in Fadu Pty Ltd v ACN 008 112 196 Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1965 , I directed that the parties file and serve draft minutes of order to give effect to my findings and reasons and to make submissions on costs.
 It was only the respondents invocation of s 87(3) --- and the respondents in the circumstances had the incentive to do so --- that resulted in a lesser success for the applicants. 3 Accordingly, I will order that: (i) the application be dismissed; and (ii) on the cross-claim, the terms of clause 2 of the Deed Poll dated 30 September 2005 be varied so as to read as follows: "2.
 It is equally well accepted that in the exercise of that discretion: (i) ordinarily costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order; (ii) where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of the claim, the circumstances may make it reasonable that the litigant bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he or she has failed; and (iii) a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other parties' costs of them.
