 By letter from ONGC to Clough dated 15 April 2006, and in response to these requests, ONGC provisionally extended the time for completion of the works to 31 January 2007 without prejudice to its rights to recover liquidated damages, in accordance with the provisions of the Construction Contract.
 On the basis of the two variations to which I have referred, Clough, within a reasonable time of the date of each variation, was required to extend the performance guarantees to 31 March 2008 and June 30 2008 respectively.
 I do not accept Clough's submissions that the date for Practical Completion was at large and therefore that cl 3.3.2 could not be complied with because the duration of the extension was not clear.
 It follows that, in calling up the performance guarantees in respect of those breaches, ONGC was acting according to a legal entitlement under cl 3.3.3 untainted by conduct which could even arguably be characterised as unconscionable in contravention of the TPA.
