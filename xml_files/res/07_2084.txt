 ASIC INVESTIGATION 11 Since June 2005, pursuant to subs 13(1) and (6) of the ASIC Act , ASIC has been investigating suspected contraventions of ss 184 and 588G of the Act, s 12DA of the ASIC Act and ss 373 and 409 of the Criminal Code of Western Australia for the period from 1 July 2003 and continuing by several entities associated with the Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd ("Westpoint Group"). 12 Since about March 2006, ASIC has made enquiries for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the corporations legislation for the period from 1 January 1998 and continuing by several entities, including the Defendant, which have been associated with the sale of financial products of the Westpoint Group ("Westpoint Investments"). 13 In Ms de Boer's affidavit, she states that she suffered a depressive illness "largely due to worry" arising from the Westpoint Group collapse in late 2005 early 2006.
 Ms de Boer, according to her affidavit, was still undertaking comprehensive weekly counselling to enable her to cope with depression as well as undergoing occasional hospitalisation. 14 In or about early 2006, Ms de Boer reduced the office opening hours of the defendant, its assets were sold and she resolved to close the business.
 She advised that as from 30 June 2006 the defendant would cease to carry out any financial services business that required such a licence. 15 In about late May to June 2006, the defendant "sold" its clientele to a Mr Cubbage, and transferred its client files to him. 16 Between March and December 2006, ASIC sought to contact Ms de Boer and served notices under s 912C of the Act, on the defendant.
 She also says that she is unable, for medical reasons, and because she has not retained any documents relevant to the matter to produce any written statement as requested by ASIC or otherwise to assist ASIC. 18 As at 16 January 2007 the defendant had not and to date still has not filed a copy of its audited financial statements to 30 June 2006 in breach of the Act. 19 From enquiries made on behalf of ASIC, the defendant quite evidently is unable to carry on its financial services business and indeed has ceased to do so.
