 There must be service of notice of the application for a stay on all creditors and contributories, and proof of this; Re South Barrule Slate Quarry Co (1869) 8 Eq 688; Re Bank of Queensland Ltd (1870) 2 QSCR 113. 3.
 Without recording all that evidence, I am persuaded and so find that the company is solvent and is likely to remain so for a reasonable period of time. 12 The evidence is that Mr Carrello, the deed administrator, currently has clearly more than sufficient funds for payment of all outstanding fees, costs, expenses and liabilities which it incurred during the administration of the DOCA and during liquidation.
 Further, during the course of the administration the company has received revenue of about $2.2 million, its ordinary operating expenses are less than $30,000 a month and it is expecting to continue to receive substantial income between now and July 2008. 14 The original applicant for the winding up order was the Australian Taxation Office.
