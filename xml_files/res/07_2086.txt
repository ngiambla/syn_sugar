 The respondents have now made an application for costs, including indemnity costs, in the amount of $203,909.89. 2 The basis of the claim for indemnity costs is that on 20 July 2007 the respondents made an offer of compromise to settle the proceedings.
 His Honour concluded, in that case, that costs should be awarded, but only such costs as 'would not have been incurred in relation to the s 347 cause of action in any event and are only attributable to the other successful causes of action'.
 In Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 Jessup J followed Seven Network Operations observing that it appeared to be 'the only occasion upon which the Court has decided a costs application by reference to the fact that the proceeding involved claims arising under different federal statutes, one of which was the WR Act'.
 It would be unjust to deny the respondents indemnity costs, having regard to the terms of the offer, the outcome of the proceedings and the reasons for the result. 27 That leaves the question of costs prior to the abandonment of claims under the WR Act.
