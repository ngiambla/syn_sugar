 The respondents have now made an application for costs, including indemnity costs, in the amount of $203,909.89. 2 The basis of the claim for indemnity costs is that on 20 July 2007 the respondents made an offer of compromise to settle the proceedings.
 It would be unjust to deny the respondents indemnity costs, having regard to the terms of the offer, the outcome of the proceedings and the reasons for the result. 27 That leaves the question of costs prior to the abandonment of claims under the WR Act.
