 The deed was a confidential exhibit in the proceeding. 2 By order dated 30 November 2007 (as varied by a further order which I made this morning) I ordered that: "1... 2... 3 On or before 3 December 2007 the Applicant's solicitors shall post by ordinary mail to all group members in the representative proceeding: a a notice of proposed settlement in a form approved by the Court in respect of settlement of the representative proceeding in terms of the Deed of Settlement between the Applicant's and the first and second Respondents dated 13 November 2007 ("the Deed of Settlement"); and b an opt out notice pursuant to s 33J of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Act ") in a form approved by the Court; 3A any group member who wishes to exercise their right to opt out of this representative proceeding shall on or before 4.00 pm on 18 December 2007 file with the Court a completed opt-out notice. 4 Any group member, who pursuant to s 33Y of the Act , wishes to object to approval of the settlement of the representative proceeding in terms of the Deed of Settlement shall, on or before 4.00 pm on 18 December, file a notice of objection setting out the reasons for their objection."... 3 I fixed the hearing of the application for approval of the MFL settlement for hearing this morning. 4 The applicant's solicitors complied with order number three which I made on 30 November 2007.
 It is sufficient for present purposes to note that it provides for measures by which title to their properties will be restored to group members. 10 It is clear from the material exhibited to Mr Warren's affidavit that the applicants' legal advisers have dealt with the considerations that were identified in the authorities, which bear on the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 33V of the Act .
