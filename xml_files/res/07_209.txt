 The account of the evidence given by the applicant at the 5 May 2004 hearing contained in the decision of the previous member was, without objection by the applicant, treated as accurate.
 The appellant claimed he was elected team leader of the Falun Gong tutorial centre and promoted Falun Gong in his spare time as well as participating in a "sit-in" in Beijing.
 The appellant claims he continued to practise Falun Gong in secret and that police attended the house of a fellow Falun Gong practitioner while the appellant was there practising Falun Gong and arrested the appellant and his friend: both being subsequently sentenced to a labour camp for one year and two years respectively.
