 There is simply no purpose to be served in making an Order or a declaration to the effect that the events of 7 November 2007 resulted in the passing of a resolution to remove AOL and conditionally appoint a company to act as responsible entity that will not act as responsible entity.
 Secondly, AOL contends that the meeting on 7 November 2007 was properly convened; the members present, properly elected Mr Johnston as chairman; the conduct of the meeting fell within the authority and control of the chairman of the meeting and Mr Johnston was entitled to decide that the motion ought not to be put to the meeting.
 Section 252B provides that a responsible entity must call and arrange to hold a meeting of scheme members to consider and vote on a proposed special or extraordinary resolution on the request of members with at least 5% of the votes that may be cast on the resolution or at least 100 members who are entitled to vote on the resolution.
