 They include the necessity of maintaining confidence in, and respect for, the authority of the Courts ..... [70] The power to strike out a statement of claim or to dismiss an application as an abuse of process is to be exercised sparingly and upon an examination of the relevant circumstances of the particular case before the Court.
 Clearly, His Honour would not have considered that the orders he made in that case constituted the resolution of any " issue ". 65 The principles of res judicata and issue estoppel apply where earlier proceedings are in the nature of an application for judicial review, including the " review " undertaken pursuant to s 21.
 The lawful discharge of the functions conferred by s 16 " must necessarily have been determined " in reaching the conclusion that Mr Brock was eligible for surrender. 67 It is considered unnecessary to resolve the question as to the extent of -- or the nature of -- the review which is permitted under s 21 as to whether the requirements of s 19(1) have been satisfied.
 His Honour, however, also there referred to Knauder v Moore [2002] FCAFC 404 ; (2002) 127 FCR 327 and Brock v United States of America [2007] FCAFC 3 ; (2007) 157 FCR 121 as providing a basis for the " current practice " that some form of review was permissible. 68 For present purposes it is sufficient to note that there was no challenge in the s 21 review to whether or not there had been compliance with s 16(2)(a)(ii) and to note that there was no outstanding collateral challenge to the s 16 notice prior to the s 21 review being concluded.
