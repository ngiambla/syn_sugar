 The reason why the Company had sought an adjournment under s 440A(2) is that a meeting of creditors had been convened for 23 November 2007 for the purpose of considering a proposal that the Company enter into a Deed of Company Arrangement.
 The Company indicated that, if the Court is not satisfied that all of the prerequisites for the making of the winding up order are satisfied, it would consent, to the extent necessary, to the waiver of any rules or other formal requirements necessary for the making up of winding up order.
