 1 It appears from the materials before me and from what I am told by the corporate receivers appointed to the sixth defendant on 20 April 2006, that there may have been arrangements in place with companies in and associated with the Westpoint Group whereby Westpoint Realty Pty Ltd (Westpoint Realty), the sixth defendant, arranged insurance of properties held by those companies and that it did so as one of the insured parties.
 I am concerned, however, that there is a real possibility that the commercial property holders, a number of which are related to each other, may be prejudiced if the sixth defendant were to allow the insurance to lapse without prior notice to them, or to their administrators, so that appropriate action could be taken. 4 It appears that the matter has acquired this degree of urgency because of the very short notice upon which Mr McMaster was informed through Mr Carey, the director of Westpoint Realty, of this expiry of the insurance.
 The Corporate Receivers shall be entitled to immediately reimburse themselves, without the authorisation of the signatories required for the operation of the Sixth Defendant's bank accounts, from the Sixth Defendant's bank account for so much of the cost of such insurance as is incurred by the Corporate Receivers and the Sixth Defendant's bankers shall be permitted to allow such reimbursement. 3.
