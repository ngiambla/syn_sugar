 On 4 March 2004 a delegate of the first respondent refused the application and, on 24 March 2004, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.
 On 13 July 2004 the Tribunal was reconstituted due to the retirement of the member who had conducted the original hearing. 3 On 31 August 2004 the appellant was sent a letter pursuant to s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") informing him of the reconstitution of the Tribunal.
 The appellant attended and was assisted by a Hindi interpreter --- the same interpreter who had assisted at the hearing on 2 June 2004. 4 Having regard to the grounds raised in the appellant's application to the Federal Magistrates' Court and to the grounds of appeal on which he relies in this Court it is unnecessary to rehearse the claims which he made in support of his application for a protection visa.
