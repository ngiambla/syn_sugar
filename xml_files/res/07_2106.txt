 The applicant asserts that the Minister's practice of providing legal assistance for asylum seekers and not for people facing visa cancellation under s 501 amounts to unlawful discrimination in circumstances where no specific law sanctions such a practice.
 The applicant asserts that the fact that the Minister discriminates between asylum seekers and permanent residents facing visa cancellation is beyond anything that could reasonably be regarded as within his discretionary power. 13 I do not consider that there is any merit in that contention.
 The possible consequence of deterring other non-citizens from committing similar offences is not an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 501(2) of the Act, in deciding whether a visa holder should be permitted to remain in Australia, see Tuncok v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 172 at [44] . 20 Next, in relation to this ground, the applicant appears to advance a contention that having regard to the provisions of s 201 , the use of s 501 is for an improper use or an act of bad faith.
 If I decide that the applicant does not pass the character test, I must consider whether to exercise the discretion in s 501(1) not to cancel the applicant's visa, notwithstanding that the applicant does not pass the character test.
