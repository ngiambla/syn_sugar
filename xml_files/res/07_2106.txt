 The applicant asserts that the Minister's practice of providing legal assistance for asylum seekers and not for people facing visa cancellation under s 501 amounts to unlawful discrimination in circumstances where no specific law sanctions such a practice.
 The applicant asserts that the fact that the Minister discriminates between asylum seekers and permanent residents facing visa cancellation is beyond anything that could reasonably be regarded as within his discretionary power. 13 I do not consider that there is any merit in that contention.
 If I decide that the applicant does not pass the character test, I must consider whether to exercise the discretion in s 501(1) not to cancel the applicant's visa, notwithstanding that the applicant does not pass the character test.
