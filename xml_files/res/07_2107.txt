 Unless the special circumstances are so cogent and the risk so very low that the proper exercise of discretion requires the grant of bail, any real risk of flight should be decisive against the grant of bail. ' (Their Honours' emphasis. ) 11 As I have noted, the present case is somewhat unusual to the general one which their Honours were considering, namely: Mr Tervonen has succeeded, in front of two single judges of the court, in his applications under ss 16 and 19 .
 I am able safely to conclude that Mr Tervonen has not discharged the onus of showing an absence of risk of flight. 14 I am also mindful that, although he has spent a considerable period in custody since his original arrest in mid-2006, the two appeals will be heard in a reasonably short period of time. 15 In my opinion, I should order that Mr Tervonen be kept in custody until Finland's appeal against Gyles J's decision and the orders made by him on 20 December 2007 is heard.
