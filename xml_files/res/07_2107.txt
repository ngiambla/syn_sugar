 1 This is the return of a warrant issued by a judge of the court on Friday last for the arrest of Jan Tervonen pursuant to s 21(6)(e) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth). 2 The circumstances in which Mr Tervonen came to be arrested were that, on 20 December 2007, the previous day, Gyles J had ordered that a magistrate in New South Wales, in respect of whom there was an arrangement in force under s 46 of the Act, order Mr Tervonen's release from custody: see Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067. 3 On Friday 21 December 2007 a number of things occurred.
 Unless the special circumstances are so cogent and the risk so very low that the proper exercise of discretion requires the grant of bail, any real risk of flight should be decisive against the grant of bail. ' (Their Honours' emphasis. ) 11 As I have noted, the present case is somewhat unusual to the general one which their Honours were considering, namely: Mr Tervonen has succeeded, in front of two single judges of the court, in his applications under ss 16 and 19 .
 Forensic examination suggests it had been altered by the substitution of a new photograph of the passport holder and a change to his date of birth without alteration of the machine readable data on the passport as issued, thereby demonstrating an alteration or unusual disparity between the details apparently recorded on the passport and those previously inserted by the country of issue.
 I am able safely to conclude that Mr Tervonen has not discharged the onus of showing an absence of risk of flight. 14 I am also mindful that, although he has spent a considerable period in custody since his original arrest in mid-2006, the two appeals will be heard in a reasonably short period of time. 15 In my opinion, I should order that Mr Tervonen be kept in custody until Finland's appeal against Gyles J's decision and the orders made by him on 20 December 2007 is heard.
