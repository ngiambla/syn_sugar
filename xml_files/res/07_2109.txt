 In my opinion, the nub of the question is that raised in the last submission by counsel for the Repatriation Commission, when it was put that if the matter goes back, the Tribunal would be able to reject the claim. 3 In my opinion, that submission is contrary to the principal decision --- see Hall [2007] FCA 2021 at [22] ).
 In my view, once the hypothesis was found to be reasonable, and once the facts were found as the Tribunal did, then, when the concept of beyond reasonable doubt is properly understood, the Tribunal could not properly find, as required by s 120(1) of the Veteran's Entitlement Act 1986 (Cth), that there was no sufficient ground for making the determination beyond reasonable doubt. 4 In my opinion, it is only at a very high level that to so hold may be regarded as a finding of fact.
 The course of having the matter remitted would lead to further delay and cost, and risks a misunderstanding of the effect of the principal decision if a submission such as that just made to me was made to the Tribunal. 5 Accordingly the decision of the Repatriation Commission under review is set aside and in lieu thereof I determine that the death of Robert Thomas Butler was war caused and that the applicant, Ruth Isobel Hall, is entitled to a war widow's pension as from 27 February 2005.
