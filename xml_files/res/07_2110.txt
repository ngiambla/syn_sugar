 In such circumstances the threshold for obtaining leave is somewhat lower than otherwise might be the case: Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd [2000] FCA 1572 at [45] ; Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 147 at [39] . 8 There will be undoubted prejudice to the applicant which, to an extent, at least arguably, may be irreparable, if the stay is not granted and the injunctions are not extended to enable the leave application to be made.
 It is necessary for the applicant to establish that there are reasonably arguable grounds of appeal: Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [1991] HCA 59 ; (1991) 66 ALJR 219 at 220. 11 It cannot be said, emphatically, in my opinion, that the correctness of my construction of clause 3.3 of the Construction Contract, and in particular clause 3.3.3, is unassailable.
 The same is the position in relation to my findings on the balance of convenience. 13 In my opinion, it is appropriate to grant a stay and to extend the injunctions: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Merribee Pastoral Industries Pty Limited [1998] 84 FCR 367. 14 In light of those reasons, the orders that I will make, therefore, are, as to the first four orders, in terms of paragraphs 1 to 4 of the notice of motion as amended.
