 The parties have put forward a summary of Scott Cane's book and they have agreed that the facts in the summary are true facts. 8 I have read an affidavit by Mr Gavin Dunn for the State of Western Australia.
 It is also good that it has happened this way, because a lot of people have had goodwill and have come together to make the agreement; and that is a very good thing. 11 Also, of course, it is relevant that I take into account that the parties have acted freely, with goodwill and with expert advice from the lawyers and anthropologists.
 The claimants have been very careful to put their case properly and the State of Western Australia has considered it very well. 12 Now, I am going to make the orders in the terms agreed, but before I do so, I want to say something more as a law person.
 I live - because of old people taught me which our land is and I've been waiting and talking for the last 20 years or more and now I got it here for people and for all our young people to come, in years to years to come, generation to generation.
