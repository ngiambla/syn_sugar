 1 This is an application for the judicial review of a decision by an acting Magistrate on 6 May 2001, to issue a warrant for the arrest of the Applicant, in respect of what was then alleged to be an offence against s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 .
 For reasons that will transpire it matters not whether it is that statute or the Judiciary Act 1903 , which is called in aid in some way to ground the relief sought, or at least a declaration in respect of the validity of that warrant.
 And then (iii): A decision in connection with the issue of a warrant, including a search warrant or a seizure warrant. 8 At present there is pending before the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland, an appeal from a decision given by Byrne J on 13 July 2007, in which his Honour dismissed an application which, in essence, sought to challenge the arrest warrant I have mentioned.
