 The appellant suggested that the Tribunal may have sent the invitation to his old address despite the fact that he had given notification of a new address. 5 The Federal Magistrate considered the procedural issues raised by the manner in which the proceeding had been commenced.
 Two specific issues do appear to be raised in those documents, namely, that the Tribunal did not consider the appellant's refugee claim and independent country information and that the Tribunal did not invite the appellant to the hearing as required by the Act .
 The notice of appeal asserts that the Tribunal sent the hearing invitation to the appellant's old address when he had already notified his change of address. 10 At the hearing of the appeal before me the appellant appeared in person.
