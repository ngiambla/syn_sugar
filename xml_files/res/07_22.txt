 1 Motion of the second respondent to transfer the proceeding to the Victoria District Registry. 2 The proceeding is an application by way of appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).
 The applicants applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) to review a decision of the first respondent determining under the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 (Cth) the extent of what the AAT called the King Valley wine region in Victoria.
 Order 53 r 1 defines "appropriate Registry" as a "District Registry in the State or Territory in which the Tribunal heard the matter. " 11 The researches of counsel have not revealed any authorities as to what is meant by the "hearing" referred to in O 53 r 1, nor any discussion as to the term "appropriate Registry". 12 In Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglon (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 519 Ryan J indicated that because O 53 was not qualified in any way by reference to the other Rules, it should in the first instance determine the practice and procedure applicable to appeals from the AAT.
