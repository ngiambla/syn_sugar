 1 Motion of the second respondent to transfer the proceeding to the Victoria District Registry. 2 The proceeding is an application by way of appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).
 Order 53 r 1 defines "appropriate Registry" as a "District Registry in the State or Territory in which the Tribunal heard the matter. " 11 The researches of counsel have not revealed any authorities as to what is meant by the "hearing" referred to in O 53 r 1, nor any discussion as to the term "appropriate Registry". 12 In Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglon (1990) 12 AAR 515 at 519 Ryan J indicated that because O 53 was not qualified in any way by reference to the other Rules, it should in the first instance determine the practice and procedure applicable to appeals from the AAT.
