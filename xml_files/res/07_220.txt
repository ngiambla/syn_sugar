 For the reasons that I gave in my principal judgment ([2007] FCA 97 at [269]-[271]) Triad should receive only a distribution of the proceeds of sale of Main Camp Plantation by way of a fully franked dividend, and should not be able to claim consultancy fees in the liquidation.
 CONSULTANCY FEES 15 The claim for consultancy fees arose in circumstances where there was a dispute whether an agreement was made in March 2001 between the three executive directors at the time, Mr Bax, Mr Gulson and Mr Reece, to suspend or defer invoicing the fees.
 They contended that I had found that the plaintiffs were not entitled to an order for payment of the fees in full and were also not entitled to an order for specific performance of an agreement to distribute in accordance with option B.
