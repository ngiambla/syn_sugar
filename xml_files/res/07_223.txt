 The background facts and circumstances are set out comprehensively in the reasons of the Tribunal, and I particularly refer to pages 4, 5 and 6 of the Tribunal's reasons, which are contained at pages 129, 130 and 131 of the Appeal Book. 3 One of the background facts of significance in this particular matter is that the Tribunal invited the appellant to attend before the Tribunal and put before the Tribunal any evidence upon which he may seek to rely.
 And the appellant has failed to appear before the court this morning. 4 There is, no doubt, consistent with authority, that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed to determine pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) the matters before it, upon the failure of the appellant to appear at the hearing.
 The appellant has failed to demonstrate any foundation for any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal, and in consequence, has failed to establish that Federal Magistrate Baumann fell into error by failing to find jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal. 5 Accordingly, the appeal must necessarily be dismissed with costs. 6 Leave is given to amend the title of the respondent Minister to 'Minister for Immigration and Citizenship'.
