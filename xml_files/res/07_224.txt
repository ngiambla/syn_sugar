 There is, in the Appeal Book before me, a transcript of the hearing and some aspects of the transcript require some attention. 5 The Tribunal Member at AB34, at about point 2, recognised that the appellant wished the Tribunal to take into consideration, as part of the application, a letter from an elder in the Ashfield Presbyterian Church.
 At AB53, the appellant seemed to recognise that the individuals who would be most disposed to difficulty in the practice of the Christian faith would be leaders of the church and the appellant is not a leader of the church. 14 At AB48 and 49, the Tribunal Member discusses with the appellant, in questioning, certain aspects of the Christian faith and, in particular, the appellant seemed unable to identify aspects of the resurrection which is, of course, the foundation of the Christian faith and the appellant was not able to explain in any detail aspects of the sacrament of baptism which reflects the rebirth in the Christian light.
 However, the Tribunal also made this finding at AB140: 'However I consider that the applicant has concocted his claims of being a Christian in China to support his application for refugee status and I consider his attendance at church has been for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence to strengthen his claims.
