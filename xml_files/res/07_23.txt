 Mr Hopkins claimed $23,888. 2 On 11 August and 19 October 2000 respectively the Commissioner for Taxation (the Commissioner) issued amended assessments under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (ITAA) to Messrs Starr and Hopkins in respect of the year of income ended 30 June 1996.
 If the taxpayer had not included, in the return, the amount included by the Commissioner or if the taxpayer had claimed a deduction or rebate disallowed by the Commissioner (s 224(1)(d)) then the taxpayer was liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax.
 Where the prescribed provision or provisions were applied in relation to a scheme within the meaning of Pt IVA and "the scheme was entered into or carried out for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling a person to pay no tax or less tax" then additional tax at 50 per cent or 25 per cent of the difference was payable by way of penalty.
