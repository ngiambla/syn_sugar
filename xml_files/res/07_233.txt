 In his application for a protection visa the appellant claimed to have a well founded fear of persecution as a result of his Falun Gong practice in the PRC.
 The appellant asserted that he suffered mental and physical torture at the hands of the PRC authorities. 3 On 24 June 2005 a delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa and on 21 July 2005 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.
 There was nothing to support the claims of the appellant besides unsubstantiated assertions; insufficient particulars were provided by the appellant; the credibility of the appellant could not be tested.
 When the appellant failed to appear at the hearing the Tribunal decided to exercise the power under s 426A(1) of the Act and proceeded to make a decision without taking any further action to allow the appellant to appear before it.
