 Either, accept withdrawal of the application made on the footing that the appellant was a refugee in circumstances where the appellant made it clear to the Tribunal that he did not press such a position or secondly, the appellant hoped that the Tribunal would formulate a report or recommendation that action be taken against the migration agent who had falsely and improperly induced the appellant to apply for a protection visa as a refugee.
 The Tribunal's role in undertaking that review is to determine whether it can be affirmatively satisfied that the appellant is a person who meets the description of a refugee and thus a person who holds a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason should the appellant return to his country of origin.
 There is no substance in this contention because the evidence upon which the appellant relied was properly provided, frankly and directly, by the appellant to the Tribunal and in those circumstances, no obligation arose in the Tribunal to put to the appellant the information which the appellant had himself and through his witnesses provided to the Tribunal.
 Accordingly, there is simply no contravention of s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) on the part of the Tribunal. 8 At page 72 of the Appeal Book, the Tribunal recites some of the background circumstances and they are these. 'In his original protection visa application, the Applicant claimed fear of persecution in Lebanon for Convention-related reasons of "religion. " Briefly, it was claimed that the Applicant is Muslim who lived in a Christian suburb in Lebanon and faced harassment from Christians.
