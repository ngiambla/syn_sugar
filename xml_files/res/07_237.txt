 I then foreshadowed the possibility that I would exercise my power to set aside my judgment, then allow Mr Wiegand's application, set aside the Tribunal decision in question and remit the matter to the Tribunal to be reheard and determined: see O 35 r 7(1) of the Federal Court Rules . 2 My reason for so acting can be shortly explained.
 On 29 November 2006 I heard a matter in another judge's docket which involved an appeal under the AAT Act, this time by Comcare, raising an issue of construction of the definition of "disease" in s 4(1) of the SRC Act which was contrary to that assumed to be, or else accepted by Comcare as, correct in the earlier matter and on which I had relied.
 Different counsel appeared in each matter. 3 It was only during the hearing of the latter matter that I became aware of the dictum of French and Stone JJ in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232 at [63] - [66] with which, with respect, I agreed, but which nonetheless was inconsistent with the test that I had applied in Wiegand . 4 On 19 January 2007 I delivered judgment in the latter matter.
