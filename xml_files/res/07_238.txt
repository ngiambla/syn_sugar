 At item 13 of that document (AB26), the appellant was asked, 'To which address do you want correspondence sent? ' and the appellant responded, 'To my postal address' nominated as '64 Harrow Road, Glenfield, 2167. ' 7 On 16 October 1998, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs wrote to the appellant advising that his application for the grant of a protection visa had been refused as he did not meet the relevant criteria, namely a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
 The Tribunal also advised the appellant that he would be entitled to ask the Tribunal to obtain oral evidence from another person. 12 The Tribunal noted in the correspondence that the appellant would need to tell the Tribunal whether or not he wanted to come to the Tribunal to give oral evidence and whether or not he wanted to ask the Tribunal to obtain evidence from other people.
 The letter also said: 'If you tell us that you want to give oral evidence, we will write to you shortly and advise you of your hearing date. ' 13 The letter also said: 'If you do not respond by 22 March 1999 we will assume that you do not want to come to a hearing and the Tribunal may make a decision on your case without further notice. ' 14 On 21 March 1999, a document (AB48) was sent to the Tribunal nominating a postal address of PO Box 1178, Bankstown, NSW 1885. 15 On 22 March 1999 (AB49), the Tribunal wrote to the appellant at the nominated address for service, namely PO Box 1178, Bankstown, NSW 1885 and responded to the response.
 In that letter the Tribunal says: 'We have received your "Response to Hearing Offer" telling us that you want to come to a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence. ' The letter says that the hearing will take place on Thursday, 22 April 1999 at 2 pm. 16 That letter invited the appellant to contact Ms Jennifer Livingstone if any assistance was needed.
 The letter also noted that the Tribunal will not change the hearing date unless there are very good reasons for doing so and said: 'If you think that you may be unable to attend the hearing, you should contact the Tribunal immediately. ' 17 The letter also said: 'If you do not attend the hearing and a postponement has not been granted, we will assume that you no longer want to come to a hearing and the Tribunal may make a decision on your case without further notice. ' 18 On 23 April 1999, a document (AB51) was sent to the Tribunal seeking an adjournment of the hearing.
 Many thanks. ' 19 That response or document was sent to the Tribunal purportedly on behalf of three individuals including the present appellant. 20 On 27 April 1999, the Tribunal wrote (AB53) to the appellant at the nominated address for service advising that the hearing had been re-listed for a new hearing date, namely Thursday, 6 May 1999 at 10.45 am.
 The letter advised: 'If you do not attend this new hearing, it will be assumed that you do not want to come to a hearing and the Tribunal may make a decision on your case without further notice. ' 21 At AB54 there is reference to evidence that that letter seems to have been collected from the post office relevantly attached to the post box number 1178 in Bankstown.
 The note records: 'I spoke with Rose at Bankstown PO, and she informed me letter had been collected on 29/4. ' 22 On 20 May 1999, the Tribunal wrote (AB55) to the appellant advising that a decision had been reached by which the Tribunal had concluded that the appellant did not satisfy the criteria for the status of a refugee.
 If I return to China I will be at risk of suffering persecution within the meaning of the 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees. (2) Member of the RRT failed to understand my claims and failed to consider relevant matters.
 He sought an extension of time in order to bring that application.

 At paragraph 139, his Honour said this: 'Whilst the consequences of fraud practised upon the decision-making process of an administrative tribunal might, in some cases, lead to the conclusion that a decision had been made without authority or exhibiting jurisdictional error, that conclusion will generally be reached by reference to notions of procedural fairness.
