 However it is necessary to consider whether there is any real prospect of the complainant securing through the process of conciliation the outcome identified, namely a protection visa. 4 The legal representatives of the applicant have drawn attention to the fact that some of the individuals who were interviewed by the PRC officials were later given protection visas, and it is submitted that the circumstances of the applicant (that he was one of the group who were interviewed) are such that he might secure a similar outcome from conciliation.
 Indeed, the fact that the Minister has very recently considered the circumstances of the applicant (including the fact that he was interviewed) and has rejected submissions on his behalf made by his solicitor directed to obtaining a protection visa fortify my view, having regard to the material to which I was taken, the applicant is not likely to secure through the process of conciliation the result identified.
 The Minister is under a statutory duty to remove the applicant from Australia: see s 198 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), and also more generally, Li v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1414 and Li v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 667. 5 In those circumstances it appears to me that as a matter of discretion, it would be inappropriate to grant an interim injunction under s 46PP and accordingly I dismiss the application.
