 For example, when asked if he was a Falun Gong practitioner at the hearing, the applicant claimed that he did not practise but thought about Falun Gong whilst sleeping.
 The applicant says he got this. 16 The applicant did not file any amended application in respect of his substantive claim although he had had the benefit of legal advice from a barrister.
 This evidence was not accepted by the Tribunal merely because the facsimile date showing on the paper contradicts to the applicant's claim that he received the copy two days before the hearing.
