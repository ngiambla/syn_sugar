 This evidence was relied upon by the applicant at trial in support of further declarations sought by him, that the University had acted in breach of cl 11 and cl 13 of Sch D of the 2004 certified agreement by the manner in which it had acted or failed to act in relation to the proceedings before the Committee.
 The Court was assisted by the University's submissions in this respect. 13 Finally, the applicant contended that the claim made by the University in its counterclaim, regarding the proper construction of the transitional provisions in the 2006 certified agreement, amounted to an unreasonable act because it 'depended upon the abstruse proposition that the defective nature of the appointment of the Committee members by the respondent rendered the proceedings nugatory'.
 I have already found that the making of that argument by the University did not amount to an 'unreasonable act' under the Act. 14 The applicant also contended that there was authority which supported the proposition that even if the appointment of the Committee was a nullity, its proceedings were not vitiated.
