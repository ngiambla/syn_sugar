 On 11 July 2005 the applicant successfully appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and that Tribunal set aside the respondent's decision and substituted a decision that an amount of $27,385.82 should be waived under s 1237AAD of the Act, leaving a recoverable balance of $3,000.
 The applicant's parents believed the Torrensville property to be their property and the applicant and his fiance intended to use the Flinders Park property as their home. 20 The Tribunal member referred to a number of cases which have considered the meaning of 'special circumstances'.
 The applicant submits that the correct test as to what constitutes special circumstances is whether the circumstances take the case out of the ordinary. 27 The Tribunal in Beadle said (at 3): 'An expression such as "special circumstances" is by its very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition.
 In the context in which the Tribunal reached this conclusion, it is to be understood as having made a judgment that neither hardship nor unfairness made it desirable to waive all or part of the applicant's debt because the applicant's circumstances were common-place rather than special.
