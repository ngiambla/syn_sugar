 The Tribunal is satisfied that this would have been sufficient motivation for a campaign of threats and intimidation against the family, including regular visits to the house to extort money, threats of acid throwing, the attack on the Applicant and her mother in a rickshaw in 1998, the beating of the Applicant's brother and the final forced eviction in September 2004.
 The Tribunal accepts that senior political figures may have directed this campaign but is not satisfied that they were motivated by anything other than a desire for monetary gain in doing so. ' 14 The 'campaign of threats and intimidation' particularised by the RRT was not because of her imputed political opinion.
 The RRT was not satisfied that any particular political opinion would be imputed to her. 20 In my view, the RRT did not make the jurisdictional error alleged, and the Federal Magistrate was right in his conclusion to that effect. 21 The appeal is dismissed with costs. 22 The name of the first respondent should be changed to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.
