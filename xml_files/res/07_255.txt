 1 I have before me an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Federal Magistrate Smith delivered on 21 November 2006 by which the Federal Magistrate made orders that an application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court by the present applicant be dismissed pursuant to rule 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules on the ground that the application did not raise an arguable case for the relief claimed.
 Those principles derive from Decor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc. (1991) 33 FCR 397 and are consistent with the principles in Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423. 6 In dealing with the application before Federal Magistrate Smith, his Honour turned to the requirements of rule 44.12(1) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules.
 Federal Magistrate Smith concluded that the application did not raise an arguable case for the relief claimed and accordingly dismissed the application. 7 In doing so, his Honour considered a range of matters put by the applicant concerning the criticism of the decision of the Tribunal.
