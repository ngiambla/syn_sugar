 Since sufficient time has elapsed to enable the applicant to appear before the court to agitate the merits of the application and the applicant has not appeared, I propose to deal with the application from the respondent that the matter be dismissed for non-appearance on the part of the applicant. 2 Accordingly, I dismiss the matter on that footing, with costs. 3 I have an application from the respondent in relation to the quantum of the costs.
 The proposition that is put to the court is that the solicitor-client costs associated with the preparation of a response to the application and incurred in addressing the merits of the application on a solicitor-client basis are approximately $2000.
 The respondent seeks an order for quantum of costs at $1,300 and I am prepared to make an order in relation to this matter on the papers at $1,300 and therefore fix the costs payable by the applicant to the respondent in that sum. 4 I make a direction that the title of the respondent be amended from Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to 'Minister for Immigration and Citizenship' and that that respondent become the first respondent.
