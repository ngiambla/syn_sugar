 The proposition that is put to the court is that the solicitor-client costs associated with the preparation of a response to the application and incurred in addressing the merits of the application on a solicitor-client basis are approximately $2000.
 The respondent seeks an order for quantum of costs at $1,300 and I am prepared to make an order in relation to this matter on the papers at $1,300 and therefore fix the costs payable by the applicant to the respondent in that sum. 4 I make a direction that the title of the respondent be amended from Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to 'Minister for Immigration and Citizenship' and that that respondent become the first respondent.
