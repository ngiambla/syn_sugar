 Moore J stated it 'was an unusual one' and it is not entirely clear 'why it was necessary for the affidavit to be ordered' or 'what information would likely be elicited in an affidavit filed in compliance with the order' (per Moore J at [31]-[33]).
 He said the applicant might be exposed to 'real injustice' from the possible consequences of non-compliance with the 15 April Order and the fact of non-compliance might 'prove to be a factor to which his Honour would attribute significance in his decision on the motion' (at [39]).
 Moore and Finn JJ dismissed the appeal in respect of the 15 April Order on the ground that it was an order made by a docket judge and a matter of practice and procedure involving the exercise of the discretion so that an appellate court should exercise caution in setting such order aside.
