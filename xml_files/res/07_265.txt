 The appellant claimed that in April 1999 after Mr Zhu attended a protest in Beijing, plain clothes police attended the training centre and tried to encourage the appellant to cease his practice of Falun Gong and told him that he was unable to practise in the park.
 The appellant claimed that in July 1999 when Falun Gong was certified as an anti-government religious organisation and banned, he and Mr Zhu organised a protest where he gave public speeches and organised others to distribute leaflets.
 The Tribunal dealt quite particularly with the question of Falun Gong not being a religion; the appellant's claim nonetheless to it being his religion; the appellant's contention that there may be a misunderstanding about the English meaning of the word 'religion' contained in the appellant's original protection visa application.
