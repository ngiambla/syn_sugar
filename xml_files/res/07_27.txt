 Mr Rydon, concerned to protect his client's rights in respect of those documents to which legal professional privilege may attach, attempted to make a "blanket" claim of privilege over all documents on the Birchgrove premises, until such time as he had inspected them ahead of the AFP.
 She acknowledged that she did not know whether it contained such evidential material. 36 Subsequently, on 30 June 2004, the AFP asserted through its solicitors that the laptop computer had not been seized under the Birchgrove warrant but had been removed from the Birchgrove premises on 24 June 2004 under s 3K(2) of the Act.
