 The applicant was advised that his application was supported by a letter dated 1 September 2005 from Mr Baiman Erkinbaev, President of the National Olympic Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic and a Parliamentary Deputy, which stated 'that you had been enrolled in the centre of Olympic preparing of national sports teams of the Kyrgyz Republic since 4 October 2003 and that you were provided with a monthly athletics scholarship of 2,000 soms'.
 The fact that your application for the visa on which you travelled to Australia was supported by the National Olympic Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic and that you left Kyrgyzstan legally, travelling on a passport in your own name, does not suggest that you were of any interest to the Kyrgyz authorities at the time you left the country.
 I put to the Applicant that Mr Erkinbaev's colleagues and most experts viewed the letter as a fake (see Nurshat Ababakirov, "Kyrgyz Parliamentarian Bayaman Erkinbaev Assassinated", Central Asia-Caucasus Analyst , 5 October 2005, downloaded from http://www.cacianalyst.org/issues/20051005Analyst.pdf, accessed 18 February 2006; Erica Marat, "Erkinbayev's Assassination Provokes Controvery in Kyrgyzstan", Eurasia Daily Monitor , 27 September 2005, downloaded from http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php? volume_id=407 issue_id=3473article_id=2370267, accessed 18 February 2006).
 The Applicant asserted that Baiaman Erkinbaev had said that the people of Kyrgyzstan needed Aidar Akaev and that this had been why he had been killed. ' 7 In its finding and reasons, the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a witness of truth in relation to his experiences which made him leave Kyrgyzstan.
