 1 The issue in these proceedings concerns the validity of Rule 31 insofar as it incorporates Rule 35 of Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations 2006 ('the 2006 Regulations') made pursuant to s 4AA(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ('the Act'). 2 The 2006 Regulations prescribe a table of diagnostic imaging services and rules for interpretation of the table.
 The question is, what does the language mean; and when we find what the language means, in its ordinary and natural sense, it is our duty to obey that meaning, even if we think the result to be inconvenient or impolitic or improbable. ' 24 The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) authorises a court to adopt a construction which would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (s 15AA).
 Issacs J distinguished between 'construction' and 'interpretation' with the latter referring to the 'meaning of the words' as opposed to their legal effect. 28 Applying the purposive principle to the interpretation of s 4AA(1) of the Act and assisted by the dictionary definitions of 'interpretation', it is apparent that Parliament intended that the eligibility for payment of fees in respect, inter alia, of diagnostic imaging services, is to be determined by rules of the type envisaged in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Act. 29 Rule 31 of the 2006 Regulations refers to items 63001 to 63482 of the table prescribed by Rule 5 of such Regulations.
 The applicant referred the Court to a decision of the Office of the Information Commissioner (Qld) in the matter of Anthony Hamilton Woodyatt v Minister for Corrective Services [1995] QICmr 1 ; (1995) 2 QAR 383, in which the Commissioner considered the words ' to remove any doubt ' and observed that such phrases ' sometimes appear in true declaratory Acts, generally in conjunction with words which make it clear that the legislature intends to declare the law (on a specific topic) as it is and has always been '.
