 The expression "nominated person" as used in the Act means 'the person identified in a patent request as the person to whom the patent is to be granted. ' As I understand it, Stack claimed to be the sole inventor of the relevant inventions.
 However the grounds ventilated at the trial appear from the reasons for judgment ( Stack v Brisbane City Council [1999] FCA 1279) and from the reasons of the Full Court ( Stack v Davies Shephard Pty Ltd Ors [2001] FCA 501).
 Such declarations were based upon his Honour's finding that Stack and Grieves were joint inventors of the relevant invention, and that it was not competent for one of two co-inventors to apply for and obtain a patent.
