 The amendment consisted of omitting the words "a substantive visa" and inserting the words "an entry permit or a substantive visa". 21 The explanatory Statement for Statutory Rules No 62 of 2000 states: "This item inserts a reference to an entry permit in 832.212(4)(b).
 The reference to an entry permit has been made because most applicants eligible under this subclass would have entered Australia under an entry permit rather than a substantive visa. " 22 Importantly for present purposes, Reg 1.03 of the Migration Regulations 1994 defined "entry permit" as follows: " entry permit has the meaning given by subsection 4(1) of the Act as in force immediately before 1 September 1994, and includes an entry visa operating as an entry permit. " The definition so picked up was that introduced by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 , i.e. "entry permit" means "permission to enter or to remain in Australia".
