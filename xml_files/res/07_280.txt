 As a consequence of the delay, this application is being made on the eve of a trial in circumstances where the application could have been made and considered by the Court much earlier.
 However, in substance, the application is being made many months after such a complaint could have been made and the jurisdiction of the Court invoked. 5 In those circumstances, it is inappropriate to grant an ex parte interim injunction the effect of which would probably be to stop a criminal trial which is scheduled to commence in three days' time.
 However, that is said in circumstances where there has not been a contested hearing and in circumstances where the reach of s 46PP , in the context of the criminal justice system, has not been explored. 7 I should note that the application purports to be a representative proceeding under Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 If the applicant is minded to do so the application for an interim injunction can be renewed. 9 The facts and circumstances giving rise to this application singularly relate to events in Queensland.
