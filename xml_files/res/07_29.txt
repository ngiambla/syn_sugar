 That is, the official records, while appearing to be a complete record of the company's transactions, did not include a great many transactions --- both receipts and expenditures --- that had been recorded in the unofficial records. 8 One fact that gives rise to some difficulty is that the entries in the unofficial records ceased at the end of December 2005.
 In my opinion Ms Stathakis was a credible witness whose evidence should be accepted. 11 Mr Blashki said that in his opinion the official records showed an unusually low profit and unusually high expenses for a business of this nature.
 In particular, the red book recorded $231,706 spent between July 2003 and December 2005 on "collating", $11,760 on "film" and $10,223 on "amenities. " The exclusion of these expenses had a significant impact on Mr Blashki's valuation and was a factor that led him to suggest that cash had been stolen from the company. 12 Mr Blashki's exclusion of the collating figure for the 2005/06 year resulted in an increase in estimated profit for that year of $192,400.
