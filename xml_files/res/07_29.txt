 That is, the official records, while appearing to be a complete record of the company's transactions, did not include a great many transactions --- both receipts and expenditures --- that had been recorded in the unofficial records. 8 One fact that gives rise to some difficulty is that the entries in the unofficial records ceased at the end of December 2005.
 In my opinion Ms Stathakis was a credible witness whose evidence should be accepted. 11 Mr Blashki said that in his opinion the official records showed an unusually low profit and unusually high expenses for a business of this nature.
 In particular, the red book recorded $231,706 spent between July 2003 and December 2005 on "collating", $11,760 on "film" and $10,223 on "amenities. " The exclusion of these expenses had a significant impact on Mr Blashki's valuation and was a factor that led him to suggest that cash had been stolen from the company. 12 Mr Blashki's exclusion of the collating figure for the 2005/06 year resulted in an increase in estimated profit for that year of $192,400.
 Mr Blashki conceded that if the disputed expenses were genuine, it would "knock the guts out of the profit" of the company. 13 The defendant and Ms Stathakis gave evidence that the collating expenses represented cash paid to casual labourers who manually put the various newspapers and other publications together for the printing business.
