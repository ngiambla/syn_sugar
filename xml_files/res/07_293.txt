 As I have indicated, it is clear from the consideration of ss 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and ss 24(1A) and 25 (2)(a) that leave is required to appeal from the decision of Scarlett FM.
 I make an order striking out the notice of appeal filed on 18 December 2006 and I make a further order that the appellants pay the first respondent's costs of and incidental to the application. 13 I further order that the quantum of the costs payable by the applicant/appellants to the first respondent be fixed in the sum of $650.00.
