 I say that the application is one, in effect, for leave to appeal because the appellants have filed on 18 December 2006, a notice of appeal from the orders and judgment of Federal Magistrate Scarlett.
 The applicant was unrepresented but assisted by an interpreter, who was not able to translate in the particular dialect of the applicants and thus the application was adjourned until 11 am on Friday, 24 November so that an interpreter with the relevant skills could be available. 8 The applicant attended the court on 24 November 2006 and gave evidence with the assistance of the interpreter.
 As I have indicated, it is clear from the consideration of ss 24(1)(d) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and ss 24(1A) and 25 (2)(a) that leave is required to appeal from the decision of Scarlett FM.
 I make an order striking out the notice of appeal filed on 18 December 2006 and I make a further order that the appellants pay the first respondent's costs of and incidental to the application. 13 I further order that the quantum of the costs payable by the applicant/appellants to the first respondent be fixed in the sum of $650.00.
