 By a process of transfer and amalgamation, which is not in dispute, that fund became subject to the Universal Super Scheme Trust Deed (as amended from time to time relevantly up to 29 June 2001). (3) The applicant's superannuation account contained only unrestricted non-preserved funds and thus could be withdrawn at any time subject to the powers and discretions of the Trustee under the deed. (4) The Trustee received a telephone request from the applicant's wife on 14 August 2001 to send withdrawal forms for the applicant.
 Mixed questions of fact and law will not found an appeal: Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 244 ; (2003) 133 FCR 290 per Branson J at [84] and Jacobson and Bennett JJ at [107], and even if (2)(b) was reformulated into a question as to whether the Trustee failed to comply with Clause 10.1(b) of the MLC Master Key Superannuation Trust Deed, that question, if a question of law, raises two difficulties: 1.
 On the other hand, underlying my concern was that if, in the circumstances of this case, reg 6.22 prohibited the Trustee from doing what it did, that is, paying the applicant's benefits into a joint bank account in the names of himself and his wife, then why, on any view, would the decision of the Trustee not to reinstate the applicant's account not be one which raised the issue of whether it was 'unfair and unreasonable': Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth), subs 14(2).
