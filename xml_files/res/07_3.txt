 APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES The onus of establishing that legal professional privilege applies to the documents or the communications they evidence is on the applicants: Grant v Downs [1976] HCA 63 ; (1976) 135 CLR 674 ( Grant v Downs 135 CLR ) at 689; Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian WorkCover Authority [2002] VSCA 59 ; (2002) 4 VR 332 ( Mitsubishi Electric [2001] VSCA 181 ; 4 VR).
 In Kennedy v Wallace , Black CJ and Emmett J inclined to the view that in the ordinary case of a client consulting a lawyer about a legal problem in uncontroversial circumstances, proof of those facts alone will provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that legitimate legal advice is being sought or given. ... (7) The concept of legal advice is fairly wide.
 It is also the case that there is no evidence concerning the role and position of the various persons identified in the schedule and most importantly any agency that may have existed with them to the applicants, namely Phillip Egglishaw (documents 41, 47, 83, 84, 104 and 109), Phil de Figueiredo (documents 39, 43 and 108), Strachans (documents 38, 93, 96, 99, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107, 111), Sanderstead (documents 86, 87 and 100) and Pantheon Trust (documents 89 and 97).
 The effect of the evidence here is similar to that described by Black CJ and Emmett J in Kennedy v Wallace [2004] FCAFC 337 ; (2004) 142 FCR 185 at 189, at [13]: '[13] The appellant's decision to base his claim for privilege in this way was attended with considerable risk since, as Lockhart J observed in National Crime Authority v S (1991) 29 FCR 203 at 211, it is not sufficient for a party merely to assert a claim for privilege nor will an affidavit asserting the purpose for which a document was brought into existence followed by a statement about the category of legal professional privilege to which the document is said to belong necessarily be sufficient.
