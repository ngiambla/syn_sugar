 The respondent had expected to arrive at the Army base at Holsworthy on or about 21 or 22 September 1980. 7 The respondent was not entitled to have his own vehicle transported to the place where he was undertaking his initial training (ie Kapooka and Puckapunyal).
 However, he was entitled to have his own vehicle with him at Holsworthy and the Army would either meet the cost of transporting the vehicle to Holsworthy or would pay a cash allowance and grant days of leave to the respondent to enable him to drive his own vehicle to Holsworthy.
