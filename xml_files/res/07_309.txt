 1 This judgment concerns the costs payable by the third respondent to the applicant in these proceedings. 2 In Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 726 , delivered on 14 June 2006, the Court held that the first and second respondents had infringed the applicant's trademarks and, as they had failed to establish any arguable defence, the applicant was entitled to summary judgment against them.
 Further, the Court ordered, by consent, that the proceeding be discontinued as against the fourth respondent, and that the fourth respondent pay the applicant costs and damages in the amount of $25,000 forthwith.
 The proceeding remains alive with respect to the second and third respondents. 5 At the 15 December 2006 directions hearing, the applicant agreed that the proceedings should be discontinued against the third respondent, subject to the resolution of the question of costs.
 I stated that, in the circumstances, my preferred course was to fix these costs, a course to which the applicant and the third respondent acceded. 6 The third respondent is apparently a person of limited means and education.
