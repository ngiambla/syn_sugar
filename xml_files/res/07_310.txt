 It is not disputed, and I accept Allan Carey's evidence, that his brother does not have any involvement in Rold or any other company in the Revetment Systems International Group.
 In my opinion it is likely that Norman Carey has exercised influence over Allan Carey in the past but that he does not now have significant influence at least in relation to the affairs of Rold.
 ASIC submitted that the benefit of the $1 million was received by Rold directly from Westpoint Corporation funds in circumstances where, on the face of it, there was no justification for the payment being made.
 There is no evidence of any immediate risk that Rold's assets will be dissipated in the absence of orders made under s 1323 or s 23 of the Federal Court Act.
