 It was tasked with coordinating a program for the provision of amenities and concert parties for troops serving in the South East Asia Region, and while initially established in NSW, it soon became a National organisation on the establishment of the RSL National Council.
 These were (i) the person provided welfare services to the Defence Force; (ii) in a prescribed operational area (here Vietnam); and (iii) as a representative of any one of six "approved philanthropic organisation[s]".
 That construction is reasonably open and more closely conforms to what I consider to be the intent of the Determination. 24 I am in consequence satisfied that the Tribunal erred in limiting the meaning of "representative" as it did.
 While it is distinguishable given its facts, the Tribunal's reasoning and the submissions made to the Court, I obviously do not agree with some of the very brief observations made by his Honour in that case.
