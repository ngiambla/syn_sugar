 These were (i) the person provided welfare services to the Defence Force; (ii) in a prescribed operational area (here Vietnam); and (iii) as a representative of any one of six "approved philanthropic organisation[s]".
 That construction is reasonably open and more closely conforms to what I consider to be the intent of the Determination. 24 I am in consequence satisfied that the Tribunal erred in limiting the meaning of "representative" as it did.
