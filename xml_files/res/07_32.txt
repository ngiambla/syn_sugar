 The Tribunal had affirmed the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse grant of a protection visa to the appellant, which decision was made on 31 January 2001. 2 The appellant is a 56-year-old woman who is a citizen of the Ukraine.
 Their concern for the appellant, though tacitly expressed, evinced obvious anxiety. 3 The appellant claimed that women living alone in the Ukraine can be subjected to attacks and there was no protective assistance for her against those circumstances, in the event of her return to the Ukraine.
 The appellant claimed that the Tribunal overlooked some critical points of her case and did not address all the relevant issues she had raised, including whether she was considered a 'traitor' because of the anti-governmental views of her family.
 The appellant also referred the Court below to the decision of SZARH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 615 , which was said by the appellant to raise similar issues to her proceedings currently before the Court. 10 The appellant's application below was heard on 22 May 2006, and a further submission was filed on 2 June 2006.
