 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister not to grant the appellant a protection visa. 2 The appellant, who is a citizen of Bangladesh, claimed to have a genuine fear of persecution if returned to Bangladesh in the reasonably foreseeable future on account of his political opinion and his relationship, as a Muslim, with a Hindu woman.
 It considered his claim that political opponents would harm him to be 'based on speculation' and it did not accept 'that there is any current threat of harm from persons who had opposed [the appellant] before his departure'. 7 Counsel for the appellant contends that the lawyer's letter was evidence that the current Tribunal was bound to take into consideration in coming to its decision.
 That was because, so the argument ran, the letter showed a risk to the appellant's well-being even after the change of government. 8 I agree with counsel for the Minister that it is not clear that that letter was not taken into account.
 Considering the reasons for decision of the current Tribunal beneficially, it appears that the letter was not specifically adverted to by the current Tribunal, having regard to its strong finding about a lack of danger to the appellant given his long absence from Bangladesh.
