 However due to a lack of country information and the Tribunal not accepting that CPIM hoodlums generally acted with the support of the CPIM, and due further to what amounted in reality to the appellant's low political profile, the Tribunal concluded that any harm and adverse attention relevantly to the appellant would be remote if he was to return to India. 7 The Tribunal further considered that there existed adequate state protection in India for the appellant in relation to his personal circumstances identified, especially in view of his family's social and economic standing in the community where he lived.
 The appellant provided further grounds and arguments in the written submissions which her Honour also addressed. 10 The Federal Magistrate considered the ambit of s 422B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") and found, in the light of authority, that she was bound to follow the decision of the Federal Court in SZBDF v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1493 ; (2005) 148 FCR 302, where Branson J considered the possible operation of principles of procedural fairness beyond the scope of the obligations imposed by s 424A of the Act and concluded there was no scope for any wider obligation to provide particulars of information in relation to the Tribunal's review process.
 In support of that proposition, the Minister referred the Court to Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407. 26 In relation to the second matter above, the Tribunal based its conclusion on the evidence that the appellant gave and in the course of which he described the activities he undertook under the instructions received from others.
