 The Tribunal raised the issue with her and said that the applicant's husband had not provided any statement or support for the claims that the visas were false and that this was contrary to her assertion. 7 The applicant asked if the Tribunal would itself check the visa stamps in the passport.
 The Tribunal not unreasonably state that she and her husband could make any necessary inquiries. 8 The Tribunal in reaching its conclusion relied heavily on the fact that the applicant's husband did not produce any evidence to corroborate her claim that the visas, although regular on their face were false, despite having been invited to do so.
 The Tribunal could properly consider that before it made any investigation of its own it should be persuaded that the appellant had provided all relevant evidence at her disposal or at least explain why it is not provided.
