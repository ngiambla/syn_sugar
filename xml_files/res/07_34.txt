 INTRODUCTION These are three appeals against appealable objection decisions made by the respondent ('the Commissioner') on objections lodged by the applicant against amended assessments of income tax ('amended assessments') for the years ended 30 June 1996, 1997 and 1998 (together 'years of income').
 On 13 July 1998 the sum of $500,000 was remitted from Ms Rule's trust account to Sparke Helmore's trust account to enable the purchase of the Quorrobolong to take place the following day, 14 July 1998.
 It is common ground that this sum was not paid to the applicant, however, the Commissioner contends that it was paid 'on behalf of, or for the individual benefit of' the applicant within par (b) of subs 108(1).
 THE 1998 YEAR OF INCOME During the year of income ended 30 June 1998, it is common ground that ACBB made the payments to Georgette listed in [11] above, save for $53,000 of the $103,000 paid by ACBB on 3 November 1997 which was paid to the applicant.
