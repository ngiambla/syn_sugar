 Introduction 1 The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has moved for the extension of orders appointing receivers to the property of various of the defendants, officers and members of the Westpoint Property and Finance Group (the Westpoint Group).
 ASIC had made determinations in 2005 and early 2006 pursuant to s 13 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act) to investigate suspected contraventions of the Corporations Act , the ASIC Act and the Criminal Code of Western Australia by companies and individuals associated with the Westpoint Group.
 The individual defendants were also directed to surrender their passports: Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey [2006] FCA 366.
 The interim injunctions granted by Siopis J were extended on 7 April 2006 until judgment on the substantive application brought by ASIC which was delivered on 20 April 2006. 10 In delivering judgment on 20 April 2006 I referred to affidavits filed by ASIC and by certain of the defendants.
 The defendants variously relied upon the affidavits of Calogero Tindaro Triscari sworn 11 April 2006, Glenn Anthony Tully sworn 11 April 2006, Cedric Richard Palmer Beck sworn 11 April 2006, John Norman Dixon sworn 11 April 2006 and Wayne John Carl Zappia sworn 11 April 2006. 11 The reasons for judgment delivered on 20 April 2006 set out in broad terms, based on the affidavit evidence, the composition and modus operandi of the Westpoint Group.
 Evidence from Oren Zohar included evidence of information received from Ms Tracey Fox who worked for the Westpoint Group that, between December 2005 and January 2006, she had been instructed by Mr Carey and by Mr Greg Nairn, the General Manager-Financial Accounting for the Group, to effect assignments of loans between entities within the Group in anticipation of Westpoint Corporation being placed into voluntary administration.
 The application for extension of the receiver and associated orders 22 ASIC seeks an extension of the Receiver Orders and Asset Preservation Orders as against Mr Carey, the fifth to tenth and twelfth defendants.
 At the time that the extension application was heard, on 18 December 2006, ASIC had almost completed negotiating with the representatives for Messrs Beck and Dixon, a final form of orders and undertakings.
 The preceding order to be subject to Mr Carey being permitted to receive and expend $4,000 per week by way of living expenses and to expend moneys for legal advice and services. 4.
 The affidavit was used to support an application for the orders which I made on 5 September 2006 requiring Mr Carey to, in effect, give discovery of documents relating to those dealings and to instruct both ING and Mercator to send relevant documents to the Registrar of the Court: Australian Securities and Investments Commission, In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Carey (No 8) [2006] FCA 1208.
 It is nationally resourced and extends to criminal, civil and administrative investigations and actions. 57 According to Mr Turton ASIC established a dedicated team of people in April 2006 to investigate the affairs of the Westpoint Group, including the conduct of its directors and officers.
 She said this was not supported when the cash deposits from Bowesco to Westpoint Corporation were considered. 99 Ms Carey-Hazell dealt with allegations concerning Richstar and in particular the transfer by Westpoint Corporation of $1,370,000 to Richstar and its loan of $1,891,268.
