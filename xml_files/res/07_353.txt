 For convenience the respondents will be referred to hereafter as 'the Moskalevs'. 2 On 30 June 2006 Driver FM dismissed an application made under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986 (Cth) ('the HREOC Act') which claimed discrimination by the Department in the provision of accommodation to the Moskalevs contrary to ss 5 , 6 and 25 (1)(b) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) ('the DDA').
 DECISION OF FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 8 By amended application filed on 26 August 2005 the Moskalevs commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('the FMC') under s 46PO of the HREOC Act claiming discrimination in the provision of accommodation by the Department contrary to ss 5, 6 and 25(1)(b) of the DDA. 9 A hearing took place on 19 June 2006 during which Mr Moskalev conducted the proceedings.
 At page 619 their Honours said: 'The power given by s 23 is expressly limited to the making of orders in relation to matters in which the Court has jurisdiction and it does not extend the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. ' Similar observations may be made of s 15 of the FMA which expressly limits that power to matters in respect of which the FMC has jurisdiction.
 However the order was made after his Honour determined that there was no discrimination under the HREOC Act. 24 Driver FM, referring to his decision in Tyler v Kesser Torah College [2006] FMCA 1 considered that even if unlawful discrimination has not been established s 15 of the FMA could be used to correct administrative error.
