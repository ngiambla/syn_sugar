 Hayes Knight applied to the Court in those proceedings (the Examination Proceedings) for an order discharging the summons on the basis that the power of the Court to conduct an examination in connection with the examinable affairs of a company did not extend beyond companies under external administration, and if the power did extend to a company not under such administration, it involved the exercise by the Court of non-judicial or executive power beyond the competence of the Parliament to confer upon it. 3 Hayes Knight also sought judicial review of the ASIC decision to authorise Highstoke to apply for the summons (the Judicial Review Proceedings).
 The parties were given an opportunity to make submissions as to the costs in the Examination Proceedings --- Highstoke Pty Ltd v Hayes Knight GTO Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 13. 6 Hayes Knight seeks an order that ASIC pay two-thirds of its costs in the Examination Proceedings from 8 February 2006, which was the date upon which ASIC intervened.
 In this regard: (i) the Respondents' first submissions on the constitutional matter dated 4 April 2006 set out the legal argument on the constitutional matter in 8 paragraphs (at [16] to [23]; (ii) ASIC's submissions filed on 2 May 2006 raised detailed arguments concerning the construction of s 596A of the [Corporations Act], as well as detailed arguments on the constitutional validity of the proposed examination; and (iii) ASIC filed supplementary submissions on 18 May 2006; (f) ASIC contentions have been held to be incorrect; (g) ASIC's involvement in this proceeding caused the Respondent to incur substantial, additional costs in responding to ASIC's submissions and additional hearing time; and (h) the Respondents were entirely successful' 7 Highstoke, seeking to spread the burden of the costs in the Examination Proceedings, submits that ASIC and itself should be ordered to pay them, in effect, jointly and severally.
