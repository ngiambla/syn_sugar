 His Honour did not consider it to be surprising that the Tribunal did not place significant weight upon the medical reports (at [35]). 8 His Honour said that the Tribunal had simply proceeded to make an adverse credibility finding against the appellant.
 In WAJR , French J considered the approach to be taken when findings of forgery are made and the Tribunal did not put to the applicant the basis upon which the authenticity of the documents might be called into question.
 Absent any such finding, there was no obligation to put to the appellant that the authenticity of the documents might be called into question or otherwise to raise concerns as to the genuineness of the documents. 17 In any event, s 422B of the Act applies.
 The analysis of the breadth of application of s 422B was dealt with by Heerey J in VXDC v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 ; (2005) 146 FCR 562 at [22] to [31].
