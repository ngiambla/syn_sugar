 Hardie has not led evidence as to its state of knowledge or belief as to validity of the innovation patent at the time the proceeding was commenced, nor as to the state of its evidence or belief as to infringement.
 The failure by Hardie to lead evidence to explain the conduct of the case in relation to the Top Hat Batten Patent and its persistent failure to comply with the orders of the Court to file evidence of infringement are sufficient to take the case out of the ordinary.
 In my opinion, the proper order to make in the present circumstances is that Hardie pay all costs of CSR that were reasonably and properly incurred rather than were necessary to be incurred.
