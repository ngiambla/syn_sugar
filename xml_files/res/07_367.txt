 The same circumstances support a contended abuse of power and jurisdictional error. 44 It can be seen from this review of the decisions sought to be challenged and the grounds of challenge that no particularised grounds are advanced in relation to the third decision under challenge, namely, the decision of Ms Jilani to execute the warrant, take possession of seized documents and deliver up those documents to the ATO (newly proposed amended review decision number 3).
 However, the challenged decision on the part of Mr Bell is not one required to be made or authorised in the relevant sense by s 3E of the Crimes Act . 67 Section 3E of the Crimes Act informs an applicant that an issuing officer will be required to reach a state of satisfaction as to a reasonable ground for suspicion about the relevant matters supported by information on oath.
