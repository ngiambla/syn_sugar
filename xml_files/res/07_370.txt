 The Court expressed itself as not being convinced that there was any error in the ultimate disposition of the matter in the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. 49 The present applicants rely on the holding by Merkel J that a decision not to consider exercising the s 417(1) power must be made by the Minister or by the Minister's properly authorised delegate.
 On any reckoning, the decision not to consider exercising the s 417(1) power was a purported privative clause decision. 61 If the former s 476(2) is governing, or if the present ss 474(1), (2) and (7), 476(2) and 476A(1)(a) apply but the argument based on 'purported' does not conclude the matter, the question that arises is whether the decision not to consider whether to exercise the s 417(1) power is vitiated for jurisdictional error in accordance with Plaintiff S157/2002 .
