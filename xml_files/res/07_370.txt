 The Court expressed itself as not being convinced that there was any error in the ultimate disposition of the matter in the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. 49 The present applicants rely on the holding by Merkel J that a decision not to consider exercising the s 417(1) power must be made by the Minister or by the Minister's properly authorised delegate.
 In addition to relying on the reasoning of Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA , they refer to the approval of his Honour's reasoning in the present respect by Wilcox J in Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1997) 147 ALR 673. 50 The applicants' present submission does not take into account Merkel J's other holding (at 125---128) to the effect that, even though the decision not to consider exercising the power had not been made by the Minister or his duly appointed delegate as required by the Act, it was nonetheless a decision made under the authority of, and in purported reliance on, s 417, and was therefore a decision 'of' the Minister for the purposes of the jurisdiction-denying provisions contained in the then ss 475(2)(e) and 485(1) of the Act. 51 The applicants rely on Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 (' Plaintiff S157/2002 ').
 On any reckoning, the decision not to consider exercising the s 417(1) power was a purported privative clause decision. 61 If the former s 476(2) is governing, or if the present ss 474(1), (2) and (7), 476(2) and 476A(1)(a) apply but the argument based on 'purported' does not conclude the matter, the question that arises is whether the decision not to consider whether to exercise the s 417(1) power is vitiated for jurisdictional error in accordance with Plaintiff S157/2002 .
