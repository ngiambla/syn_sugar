 1 This is an application for a determination of native title under s 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') in relation to all of the land contained in Lot 2084 in Deposited Plan 1075419 at Mount Hutton, Parish of Kahibah, County of Northumberland (formerly part Lot 2076 in Deposited Plan 1002743) ('the Land').
 Pursuant to s 61(1) of the Act the Land Council may make application as a non- native title interest holder for a declaration of native title. 3 A title search of the Land conducted by the legal representatives of the applicant on 3 May 2006 records that title was subject to restrictions on dealings under ss 40 and 40AA of the Land Rights Act.
 Section 40AA of the Land Rights Act provides that the Land Council may not sell, exchange, lease, dispose of, mortgage or otherwise deal with land vested in it unless it is the subject of ' an approved determination of native title' . 4 An application may be made to this Court under Part 3 of the Act for a determination of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title (s 13(1)(a) of the Act).
