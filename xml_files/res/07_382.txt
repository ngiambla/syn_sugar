 1 This is an application for a determination of native title under s 61(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') in relation to all of the land contained in Lot 2084 in Deposited Plan 1075419 at Mount Hutton, Parish of Kahibah, County of Northumberland (formerly part Lot 2076 in Deposited Plan 1002743) ('the Land').
 The application is supported by the affidavit of Barbara Guthrie sworn 7 November 2006 and Michael Green sworn 1 November 2006. 2 On 10 February 2005 the Land was transferred to the Land Council, as an estate in fee simple subject to any native title rights and interests in relation to the land immediately before the transfer, pursuant to s 36 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW) ('the Land Rights Act').
 Pursuant to s 61(1) of the Act the Land Council may make application as a non- native title interest holder for a declaration of native title. 3 A title search of the Land conducted by the legal representatives of the applicant on 3 May 2006 records that title was subject to restrictions on dealings under ss 40 and 40AA of the Land Rights Act.
 A notification day is defined in s 66(9) as a day: '...by which, in the Registrar's opinion, it is reasonable to assume that all notices under paragraphs (3)(a) and (d) in relation to the application will have been received by, or will otherwise have come to the attention of, the persons who must be notified under those paragraphs. ' 6 A Notice of Appearance was filed on behalf of the Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales on 31 July 2006 and a Notice of the Minister's Intention to Cease to Appear as a party to the application was filed on 26 September 2006.
 The Court is thus satisfied that notice requirements under s 66(2) and s 66(2A) of the Act have been complied with. 7 A letter dated 14 June 2006 from the National Native Title Tribunal ('the NNTT') addressed to the Land Council is annexed to the affidavit of Barbara Guthrie.
 A letter on the Court file dated 20 June 2006 from the NNTT describes the measures undertaken by the Registrar to comply with the requirements of s 66(3) and the Court is satisfied that the notice required by s 66(3) of the Act has been given. 8 The evidence of Ms Guthrie also establishes that Native Title Services conducted a search of the NNTT Register and found no record of any native title claim therein in respect of the Land. 9 A notice pursuant to s 86G of the Act was filed by Native Title Services on 24 November 2006 informing the Court that it does not oppose the determination sought by the Land Council that native title does not exist with respect to the Land. 10 The Court is satisfied upon the affidavit evidence that the Land Council is the holder of a non-native title interest in the Land and is entitled to bring the non-claimant application under s 61(1) of the Act.
