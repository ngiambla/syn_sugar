 The applicant, namely the Bahtabah Local Aboriginal Land Council ('the Land Council') by its 'non-claimant' application seeks a declaration that no native title exists in relation to all of the land contained in Lot 424 in Deposited Plan 755233 at Pelican, in the Parish of Kahibah, County of Northumberland (formerly known as Portion 424), Crown Plan 8691.2111 ('the Land').
 The application is supported by the affidavit of Barbara Guthrie sworn 7 November 2006 and Michael Green sworn 1 November 2006. 2 The Land was transferred to the Land Council, as an estate in fee simple on 5 August 2005 subject to any native title rights and interests that existed in relation to the Land immediately before the transfer pursuant to s 36 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW) ('the Land Rights Act').
 Pursuant to s 61(1) of the Act the Land Council may make application as a non-native title interest holder for a declaration of native title. 3 A title search of the Land conducted by the legal representatives of the Land Council on 3 May 2006 records that the title was subject to restrictions on dealings under ss 40 and 40AA of the Land Rights Act.
 Section 40AA of the Land Rights Act provides that the Land Council may not sell, exchange, lease, dispose of, mortgage or otherwise deal with land vested in it unless it is the subject of ' an approved determination of native title' . 4 An application may be made under Part 3 of the Act for a determination of native title in relation to an area for which there is no approved determination of native title (s 13(1)(a) of the Act).
