 The background to this application and the applicant's grounds of appeal filed on 18 August 2006 are set out in my reasons for judgment previously delivered on 21 November 2006: see MZXJN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624.
 This was a finding of fact, which on the evidence before it was open to be made by the Tribunal: see SZFYC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1810 at [22] . 4 The Tribunal also reached its conclusion about the absence of protection obligations on the basis of an independent reason.
 Nothing in the Tribunal's reasons suggest that it treated the examples in s 91R(2) as an exhaustive statement of what constituted or might constitute serious harm: see VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 332 at [60] to [66] per Merkel J.
 CONCLUSION 11 I should also indicate that upon the basis of what has been put before me, both by the applicant and the first respondent, and upon the basis of reading the Federal Magistrate's decision and the decision of the Tribunal, I am satisfied that the application on its merits has no basis to succeed.
