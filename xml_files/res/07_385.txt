 The background to this application and the applicant's grounds of appeal filed on 18 August 2006 are set out in my reasons for judgment previously delivered on 21 November 2006: see MZXJN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1624.
 Nothing in the Tribunal's reasons suggest that it treated the examples in s 91R(2) as an exhaustive statement of what constituted or might constitute serious harm: see VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 81 ALD 332 at [60] to [66] per Merkel J.
