 A subsidiary function is 'to carry on, outside Australia, any business or activity relating to postal services' (s 15, APC Act). 27 Section 16 provides that the functions of Australia Post include the carrying on, within or outside Australia, of any business or activity that is incidental to supplying postal services under s 14 or the carrying on of any business or activity under s 15.
 Section 16(2) makes it clear that, 'the functions of Australia Post include the carrying on, within or outside Australia, of any business or activity that is capable of being conveniently carried on by the use of resources that are not immediately required in carrying out Australia Post's principal or subsidiary function; or in the course of supplying postal services under s 14 or carrying on any business or activity under s 15. 28 By s 27 of the APC Act, Australia Post has an obligation to perform its functions, as far as practicable, in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
 That test required the Tribunal to determine, on the evidence, the purposes for which the list was brought into existence; whether there was one or more purposes and if more than one purpose including a purpose of carrying on Australia Post's commercial activities, whether that purpose was a substantial purpose. 37 The Tribunal inferentially found that such a purpose subsisted and was a substantial purpose although there is no express finding to that effect. 38 Other evidence was before the Tribunal which supported the pervasive nature of the commercial purpose influencing the bringing of the list into existence.
