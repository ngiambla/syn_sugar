 They found that Dr Ho had engaged in inappropriate practice by rendering 80 or more professional attendances on 24 days during the referral period (1 January 2000 to 6 November 2000) which constituted a prescribed pattern of services under s 106KA(1) of the Act. 6 Dr Do challenges the final report of Professional Services Review Committee No 293.
 At first blush, 'the operation of' s 106KA(1) to which s 106KA(2A) refers must be in respect of the remaining day or days --- that is, s 106KA(1) remains engaged despite one or more of the days in the pattern originally alleged being shown not to be part of any prescribed pattern.
