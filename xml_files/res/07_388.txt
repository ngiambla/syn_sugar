 They found that Dr Ho had engaged in inappropriate practice by rendering 80 or more professional attendances on 24 days during the referral period (1 January 2000 to 6 November 2000) which constituted a prescribed pattern of services under s 106KA(1) of the Act. 6 Dr Do challenges the final report of Professional Services Review Committee No 293.
 At first blush, 'the operation of' s 106KA(1) to which s 106KA(2A) refers must be in respect of the remaining day or days --- that is, s 106KA(1) remains engaged despite one or more of the days in the pattern originally alleged being shown not to be part of any prescribed pattern.
 He summarised the claims saying that the committee understood that the reasons advanced by Dr Do were the limited availability of medical practitioners in the practice due to a doctor leaving in late 1999 and said that the committee had difficulty in accepting that that constituted exceptional circumstances.
 Again, the committee found that exceptional circumstances did not exist on that particular day noting that a public holiday was a foreseeable event and that it was reasonable to expect Dr Do to implement a plan, such as a triage system, to limit the number of patients seen.
