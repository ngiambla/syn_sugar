 It is common ground that during 2002 and 2003 the applicant negotiated the 2002 Agreement with the respondent trading as Woolworths Limited Western Australian Supermarkets in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
 On the same day the applicant lodged a notification of an industrial dispute pursuant to s 99 of the Act in relation to the concerns the applicant had raised with the respondent regarding the negotiation of a replacement agreement.
 The respondent submits that the fact that no such negotiations took place is not of itself a breach of the clause in circumstances where the respondent did agree that negotiations to renew the 2002 Agreement would commence two months prior to its expiration.
