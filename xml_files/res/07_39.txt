 It will not include interests of an emotional, conscientious, ideological or intellectual kind --- Byron Environment Centre Inc v The Arakwal People (1997) 148 ALR 46 at 51-52 (Black CJ, see also at 84 Merkel J). ' 11 French J said at 36 and 37: '36 It cannot be said that the interests of traditional inhabitants of the Torres Strait regional claim area from PNG would be unaffected by a native title determination over the sea.
 The determination could protect the rights and interests of traditional inhabitants from PNG by limiting the scope of the rights and interests of the Torres Strait Regional Seas Claim applicants and their communities. ' (Emphasis added. ) 12 In the motion for joinder heard by French J, Mr Gamogab described himself as a subsistence farmer living in the Kupere Village in the South Fly District.
 Webb QC, counsel for the Commonwealth, pointed out that the Papua Act 1905 (Cth) was repealed by an Act which was itself repealed, and the effect of s 4 of the Papua New Guinea Independence Act 1975 (Cth) makes it plain that Mr Gamogab has no rights under the Papua Act 1905 (Cth) (as Mr Gamogab in one of his affidavits alleges).
