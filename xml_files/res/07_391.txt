 After considering the legislation, policy considerations and available evidence, the Tribunal finds that the visa applicant does not satisfy clause 457.223(8)(b): (b) the representation involves negotiating, or entering into agreements, for the sale of services but does not involve the actual supply, or direct sale, of the services; and 25.
 Mr Goo argued that the source of the description must have been taken by the Tribunal from the material which was given to the delegate for the purposes of the original decision the subject of the review and that because he was not given particulars in writing under s 359A(1), that that document, or that the information in that document, was to be used as the reason or part of the reason of the Tribunal, he had not been accorded procedural fairness in accordance with Pt 5 Div 5 of the Act. 13 Mr Goo's argument is that had the tribunal had regard to and used as the reason or part of the reason the description of Mr Goo as production manager in the printout provided as part of the submission of 2 May 2005, it would have said so.
 Mr Goo intended that the Tribunal act on the information he provided, including the website printout of 2 May 2005, and because of the operation of s 359A(4)(b)that was information which the Tribunal did not have to give back to him. 25 There was no part of the reasoning of the Tribunal which relied upon any distinction between the times at which that same information was provided to the delegate or to the Tribunal.
