 Its role is to represent the interests of its members and advocate what it describes in its evidence as a "sensible and proportionate regulation of the wholesale banking and financial markets". 4 It is an association made up of 141 direct and indirect participants ('Members').
 It has established a Conflict of Interest Working Group, which has a specialised role to consider conflicts of interest policy and regulation and its impact on Members' business. 7 In ASIC media releases and addresses, the Chairman and Deputy Chairman have made reference to the significance of the present case for the securities industry.
 Needless to say, ASIC and Citigroup, as well as other large investment banks, have a strong interest in these issues. 8 AFMA submits that it is uniquely placed to make submissions on these issues from a broader perspective than the parties to the proceedings, in particular in relation to the implications for the entire wholesale banking and financial markets.
 Mr Hutley SC, for AFMA, submits that this contribution would be unaffected by tactics and forensic considerations which necessarily enter into the approaches of the immediate parties to litigation. 9 He emphasised that AFMA's role would be limited to making written and oral submissions based upon the competing factual contentions that are likely to be put by the opposing parties at the conclusion of the evidence.
