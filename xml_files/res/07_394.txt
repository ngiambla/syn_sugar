 On 22 November 2005 the applicant wrote to the respondent enclosing the relevant fee. 16 On 21 November 2005 the respondent wrote to the applicant through its accountants advising the applicant that a default assessment would be prepared by the respondent as the applicant had failed to provide documents relating to the income tax return for the financial year ended 30 June 2002 and that the documents were necessary to determine the applicant's tax-related liability.
 The respondent advised the applicant of its right to object. 17 The applicant asserts that the respondent has incorrectly calculated the capital gain arising from the disposal of the property, and has incorrectly determined that the applicant is not entitled to the various capital gains tax concessions.
 Secondly, even if there was an obligation on the respondent to consider the information, it was an obligation imposed by the Act, and s 175 expressly provides that failure to comply with such an obligation does not affect the validity of the assessment. 35 In the further alternative, the applicant submitted that the failure to consider the package of information constituted a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and, in particular, the hearing rule.
