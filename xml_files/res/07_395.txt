 The loan offer 24 Under the loan offer the lender agrees that on behalf of the borrower he will pay all amounts due by the borrower to the licensor and the manager by way of licence and management fees less the $500 sum payable by the borrower for each vineplot on or before 30 June 1997 under the licence and management agreement.
 The Tribunal member considered the provisions of s 51(1) of the Act in relation to the deductions claimed for the income year ended 30 June 1997 and the provisions of s 8-1 of the 1997 Act in relation to the deductions claimed for the income years ended 30 June 1998 and 30 June 1999 respectively. 42 The Tribunal member considered whether the applicant was carrying on a business from the vineplots since they were licensed to him on 27 June 1997.
 He found that the applicant borrowed the relevant licence and management fees and interest cost of the loan save for an initial outlay of $2,204, and this was done in circumstances where the pre-payment of the licence and management fees by the lender on behalf of the applicant involved a 'round-robin' arrangement and the applicant's liability under the loan offer was limited to the primary instalment amounts per vineplot.
 He said no such inference could be drawn from the length of the period during which the scheme was to be carried out which he said pointed to a predominantly commercial purpose. 61 The fourth matter the Tribunal member considered was the result in relation to the operation of this Act that, but for this Part, would be achieved by the scheme.
