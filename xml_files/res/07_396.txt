 Introduction 1 In the course of these proceedings, the University of Western Australia (University) produced an exchange of correspondence between its solicitors and the solicitors for Dr Yan Chen who, at one time, was involved in research in association with the first respondent, Dr Gray, which led to the production of some of the intellectual property rights the subject of this litigation.
 The nature of the common interest privilege claim 3 On Friday, 16 May 2007 counsel for Dr Gray put to the Vice-Chancellor of the University in cross examination a bundle of correspondence and emails passing between the solicitors for the University and the solicitors for Dr Chen in the period 22 September 2003 to 23 March 2005.
 That does not of itself disclose a common interest with the University at the time that the correspondence came into existence unless the common interest relevant to the preservation of privilege against disclosure is supportable by the proverb that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend".
