 It should be noted that the court officer attended at level 16 before the matter was called but did not find the applicant there, nor did he respond when he was called by his pseudonym outside the courtroom before the hearing commenced.
 However, the first respondent's legal representative urged on me that I should consider the application on its merits and I have considered it appropriate to do so (see O 32 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules ). 3 Although the applicant has sought an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal, I agree with the submissions of the first respondent that the applicant requires leave to appeal and therefore requires an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal, rather than an extension of time within which to serve a notice of appeal.
 Were he to obtain leave to appeal, then the time for serving the notice would be fixed by the Federal Court Rules . 4 It has been urged on me that the leave required by the applicant should not be granted on the basis that any appeal would have no prospects at all of success.
 I am satisfied that the Magistrate's view in this regard was correct and that an appeal against that aspect of his Honour's decision has no prospects of success (see s 477 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and items 40 and 42 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Migration Litigation Reform Act 2005 (Cth)). 5 The applicant had also filed a notice of a constitutional matter under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) in the Federal Magistrates Court.
