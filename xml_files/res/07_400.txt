 It should be noted that the court officer attended at level 16 before the matter was called but did not find the applicant there, nor did he respond when he was called by his pseudonym outside the courtroom before the hearing commenced.
 However, the first respondent's legal representative urged on me that I should consider the application on its merits and I have considered it appropriate to do so (see O 32 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules ). 3 Although the applicant has sought an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal, I agree with the submissions of the first respondent that the applicant requires leave to appeal and therefore requires an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal, rather than an extension of time within which to serve a notice of appeal.
