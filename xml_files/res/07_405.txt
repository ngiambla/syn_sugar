 There may be cases, as Comcare points out, where proposed treatment, although of therapeutic benefit, is unreasonable having regard to the extent of the anticipated benefit of the cost involved, even if no similar treatment had previously been undertaken.
 There may be cases, also as Comcare points out, where treatment like the proposed treatment which in the past has had some therapeutic benefit may no longer be reasonable because the extent of the therapeutic benefit no longer justifies the cost in the light of past experience: see e.g.
