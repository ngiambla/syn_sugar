 That involved a cost of a little over $1000 for food and accommodation, and air fares of almost $600 to enable Mr Holt to travel between his home in Alice Springs and Brisbane, near where the retreat was to take place. 3 Comcare, by its delegate, decided on 22 August 2005 that Comcare would not pay for the attendance at the retreat or the expenses of the retreat, because the retreat did not constitute "therapeutic treatment" as defined in the SRC Act.
 This appeal turns upon whether it was reasonable for Mr Holt to undertake the retreat in the circumstances. 8 The term "medical treatment" is defined in s 4(1) of the Act to include: "therapeutic treatment obtained at the direction of a legally qualified medical practitioner".
 The term "therapeutic treatment" is also defined in s 4(1) to include: "an examination, test or analysis done for the purpose of diagnosing, or treatment given for the purpose of alleviating, an injury. " As noted, it was accepted before the AAT that the retreat was treatment given for the purpose of alleviating Mr Holt's injury. 9 Section 16(6) provides that Comcare is liable to pay compensation to an employee where compensation is payable in respect of the cost of medical treatment and the employee reasonably incurs expenditure in ... making a necessary journey for the purpose of obtaining that medical treatment [and/or] remaining, for the purpose of obtaining that medical treatment, at a place to which the employee has made a journey for that purpose.
