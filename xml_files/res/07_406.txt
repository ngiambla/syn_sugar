 The severe stressors ultimately relied upon, as described by the Tribunal, were the "scare charges" and the "full steam ahead incident". 18 The "scare charges" severe stressor was identified as occasions that HMAS Sydney was in port in Vietnam when small explosive devices were detonated in the water adjacent to the vessel to deter potential underwater saboteurs.
 The further range of information enabled the psychiatrist whose evidence was preferred to more critically analyse Mr Fenner's account; an illustration was Mr Fenner's claim (which that psychiatrist, and the AAT rejected) that he sought a discharge from HMAS Sydney after his first trip to Vietnam.
 The severe stressors involved Mr Fenner experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with events which involved a threat of death or serious injury to him, and which might have evoked intense fear or helplessness. 56 Mr Fenner's claim for compensation for his condition of alcohol abuse failed because the AAT was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he himself had not feared or felt helpless as a result of the scare charges or of the full steam ahead incident, despite those stressors having the character described.
 They are not part of the reasons for my conclusion. 67 The fifth and sixth grounds of appeal seem to suggest that, somehow, the AAT erred in its understanding of the way in which it should have gone about making its decision in the light of Deledio .
