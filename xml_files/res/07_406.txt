 The further range of information enabled the psychiatrist whose evidence was preferred to more critically analyse Mr Fenner's account; an illustration was Mr Fenner's claim (which that psychiatrist, and the AAT rejected) that he sought a discharge from HMAS Sydney after his first trip to Vietnam.
 Thirdly, the AAT shared the concern of that psychiatrist about the veracity of Mr Fenner's account of those traumatic events. 27 On the last matter, the AAT concluded: For reasons that we will set out more fully we do not accept the evidence that Mr Fenner has given on this aspect of the matter.
 I have come to the conclusion that the AAT erred in law in concluding that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fenner was not in fact affected by the severe stressors which he experienced, because he personally did not react to them at all.
