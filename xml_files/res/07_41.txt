 General (5) If you have 2 or more *tax losses, you deduct them in the order in which you incurred them. (6) A *tax loss can be deducted only to the extent that it has not already been deducted. (7) If you cannot deduct all or part of your *tax loss in an income year, you can carry forward to the next income year the undeducted amount.
 The other company must have enough assessable income to offset the transferred tax loss. (4) Neither company must be prevented from deducting the loss by Division 165 or 175. (5) The tax loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2 companies. (6) The tax loss can be transferred in the same year as it is incurred.
 Thus s 165-20 recognised, it was submitted, that it is possible for part of the tax loss to be referable to part of the loss year, whilst recognising that a tax loss, prima facie, relates to an entire year of income: s 36-10. 33 The use of text such as appears in s 165-20 is not isolated.
 The respondent equally relied on provisions such as ss 165-20 and 165-96(2) of the ITAA 1997 and ss 266-50, 266-95, 266-130, 266-170 and 267-50 of Schedule 2F to the ITAA 1936 as indicative of the type of specific provision that the Parliament employed when it intended the phrase "part of the tax loss" to encompass a loss referable to part of an income year. 37 The essence of this debate between the parties is, of course, the extent and scope of s 170-10.
