 1 A question has arisen whether legal professional privilege has been waived by the University of Western Australia (the University), which is the applicant in these proceedings, in relation to advice received by it before it commenced the present action. 2 In a number of paragraphs of Dr Gray's defence to the University's statement of claim, he pleads that the cause of action asserted by the University is time barred by reason of the Limitation Act 1935 (WA).
 He says that the University seeks to justify this assertion by reference to the timing at which legal advice was obtained and, by doing so and in fairness to the process, opens to scrutiny and waives privilege "over its state of mind and the basis by which that state of mind arose, prior to that discrete date" (sic).
 Absent disclosure of the material it is said that the question of the timing of the University's knowledge sufficient to enable it to commence proceedings could not fairly be assessed. 5 On the face of its Reply the University relies entirely upon the facts of Dr Gray's alleged non-disclosure of the relevant patentable invention and intellectual property as causative of its failure to commence proceedings before 21 December 2004 and as supportive of the estoppel which it raises.
 Again, this cannot, in my opinion, constitute a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to advice received by the University concerning the commencement of proceedings against Dr Gray. 8 I therefore reject the contention made that legal professional privilege has been waived in relation to legal advice received by the University prior to the commencement of these proceedings.
