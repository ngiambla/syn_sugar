 First Applicant/First Cross-Respondent BAYER CROPSCIENCE GMBH Second Applicant/Second Cross-Respondent AND: DELTAPINE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD Respondent/Cross-Claimant JUDGE: HEEREY J DATE: 15 MARCH 2007 PLACE: MELBOURNE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 1 The applicant/cross-respondent Bayer Bioscience NV (Bayer) is the patentee of Australian Patent No 623530 (the Patent).
 By notice of motion filed on 9 March 2007 Deltapine seeks leave to amend its defence and cross-claim by raising an allegation of invalidity based on the contention that the true inventor was Dr Christina Hofmann. 2 The invention the subject of the Patent relates to plant cells and plants, the genomes of which are transformed to contain at least two genes, each coding for a different non-competitively binding bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal crystal protein (ICP) for a specific target insect species. 3 In the particulars to par 9 of the draft further amended particulars of invalidity exhibited to an affidavit in support of the motion it is said that Dr Hofmann undertook research in this area between 1983-1989, and then in 1987 she spent some time working at the laboratories of a predecessor in title to Bayer.
 I agree with counsel for Bayer that the decision of the High Court in Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146 does not mean that parties have a right to withhold amendments or other procedural steps to suit their tactical assessments of the case.
