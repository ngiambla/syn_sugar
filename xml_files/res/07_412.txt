 First issue --- method of calculation of interest 4 The Commissioner contends that amounts received by Mr Guest with respect to fruit sales during the relevant year ought to be deducted from the principal before calculating the balance on which interest is charged in respect of that year.
 The loan books of account relied upon by Mr Guest show only $11,400 being credited to his loan account. 10 The Commissioner says that it does not follow that Rural Finance never received the full amount.
 The loan books of account are consistent with Rural receiving the full amount but then having wrongly applied $15,000 of it in payment of the maintenance fee that Mr Guest and his fellow investors owed to Johnson Farm Management.
