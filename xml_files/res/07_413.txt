 The Tribunal applies policy and finds that the visa applicant was not enrolled in a single full-time course of study at an educational institution leading to the award of a professional, trade or vocational qualification between 2000 and 2002.
 The Tribunal will assume that the visa applicant was dependent on his mother between 2000 and 2002, without assessing the evidence provided in relation to the review applicant's financial support for the visa applicant during that time.
 The Tribunal finds that, whilst the visa applicant did undertake some relevant study in preparation for his computer course at ITM during that period, there is insufficient evidence before the Tribunal to justify a delay of two years between finishing year 12 and enrolling at ITM.
