 1 The following are my reasons for an order that I made in each of these two proceedings on 12 March 2007, dismissing the proceedings. 2 In order to understand the genesis of these proceedings, it is necessary that I set out some background. 3 On 5 February 2007, there were eight Native Title claimant applications before the Court for judgment.
 As in those Reasons for Judgment, I will use the abbreviation "Cosmo" for "Cosmo Newberry". 5 The Reasons for Judgment were lengthy, and pursuant to an application made by the Wongatha applicants immediately following my making of the orders of dismissal and publication of my reasons, I ordered that the Registrar of this Court not notify the Native Title Registrar of the decisions for a period of 14 days.
 No party opposed the making of the order. 6 Subsequently, the Wongatha applicants asked that I extend the period but I declined to do so on the basis that whatever the position may have been immediately upon delivery of judgment on 5 February 2007, by 19 February 2007 it could no longer be said that it was not practicable for the Registrar of this Court to notify the Native Title Registrar of the decision.
