 The reason is that it was at that moment of time when any disposal of assets became operative: there was no disposal of assets until the Deed was executed and the condition precedent to its operation was satisfied. 76 (5) Payment to the Bank was at the joint and several direction of GCC and Claude Cassegrain.
 In the present case, however, the consideration provided for the payment of $8,835,083 and the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertaking, consisted of releases and contractual undertakings by GCC and Claude Cassegrain separately and jointly and severally. 78 (7) Arguably, a further reason why a Calverley v Green resulting trust did not come into being is that it would be inconsistent with the intention of at least one party to the Deed that it should do so.
 There was, of course, no agreement that the Settlement Sum was related to the different elements identified in the Cassegrain Letter. 80 (9) There is no reason to distinguish between CSIRO's paying $8,835,083 and the CSIRO Parties' releases and contractual undertakings, as making up the consideration for the Cassegrain Parties' releases and other contractual undertakings.
 I agree that, for the reasons given earlier, the Apportionment Agreement was not relevant to the operation of Part IIIA on the terms of the Deed, but hold that that Part IIIA 's operation on these terms was different from the one advanced by the applicants. 95 Thirdly, Ground 4(e) seems to assume that s 160ZN(1)(a) produces the result that GCC and Claude Cassegrain were beneficially entitled to the sum of $9.5 million as tenants in common in equal shares.
