 While the returning officers were awaiting legal advice, the candidates who had been nominated for offices caught by r 5.5 also received information to the effect that there might be problems with their nominations as a consequence of r 5.5.
 Mr Peisley advised Mr Campbell that he would reject his nomination for National Secretary, and that Mr Pryor would accept his nomination for Regional Secretary/Assistant State Secretary, Food and Confectionery Division, Victoria. 7 The returning officers rejected both nominations of Mr Reid on the basis that he already held yet another office entitling him to sit on the National Conference.
 I am only concerned with the decisions to reject Mr Reid's nomination for National Secretary, and to accept his nomination for State Secretary, Victoria, on the basis that the nomination Mr Pryor accepted was lodged first in time, and he decided not to accept its withdrawal by Mr Reid.
