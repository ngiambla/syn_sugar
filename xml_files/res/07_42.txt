 I need not enlarge upon the orders and their breach as it is clear, as her Honour found (at [78] of her reasons for judgment), that the transactions entered into by Mr and Mrs Balalis in encumbering and otherwise dealing with properties of JM Properties constituted a wilful and therefore contumacious breach of the orders.
 Rule 84.21 provides that: "A judgment or order against a body corporate which has been wilfully disobeyed may, by leave of the Court, be enforced by sequestration against the property of the body corporate or by attachment against the directors or other officers thereof or by sequestration of their property. " 5 The view taken by the Registrar's legal advisers in reliance upon a commentary in Lunn's Civil Procedure on r 84.21 is that no order could be made against Mr and Mrs Balalis as directors of JM Properties unless the applicant could also proceed against JM Properties.
 They indicated in that letter that, while the Registrar wished to continue the contempt proceedings against JM Properties, "the principal reason for this is to pursue the Directors, Mr and Mrs Balalis, for attachment pursuant to r 84.21 of the District Court Rules 1987 in relation to the alleged breaches of the Mareva Injunction Order by JM Properties".
 The letter to Mr Cooper went on to note that "subject to our receiving final instructions, we are likely to give an undertaking to the Federal Court that we will not pursue any financial penalty against JM Properties in relation to the alleged contempt of court". 8 On 19 January 2007 Mr Cooper indicated to the Registrar's lawyers that he had no objection to the application being made and he confirmed he would not be making any submissions in relation to the matter. 9 Though the present application is an unusual one, I am satisfied I ought give the leave that is sought but on the condition I will mention below. 10 There can be no doubting the seriousness of the question to be raised in the Registrar's proceedings.
