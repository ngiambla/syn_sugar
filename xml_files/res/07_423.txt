 The nature of the privilege asserted in the case before the Full Court appears to have been litigation privilege on the basis that the relevant affidavit had been prepared for use in litigation and that its filing did not destroy privilege because of the implied undertaking limiting its use.
 The Court distinguished Akins and Smoothdale on the basis that the affidavit was not brought in as part of the contemplated evidence for a hearing but as "a convenient procedural device in the nature of, but in lieu of a usual affidavit of discovery".
 It is whether answers given by Professor Robson in his cross examination by Sirtex amount to waiver of legal professional privilege in respect of the Advice. 17 Sirtex does not presently seek to adduce the Advice in evidence.
 What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large. 19 A mere reference in evidence to the fact that a person did not commence a proceeding until legal advice was taken does not imply a waiver of privilege.
