 I knew that it was not possible for the CFMEU or its employees or delegates to insist on a person joining the Union ...' The fourth respondent simply denied using the words attributed to him as set out above (see his Affidavit sworn 3 August 2006 paragraphs 18 and 19). 58 Notwithstanding the fourth respondent's knowledge that it was improper for the CFMEU or its employees or delegates to insist upon workers joining the union, nevertheless on 28 March 2003 he witnessed the third respondent's execution of the 'CFMEU Code of Conduct for Union Delegates' form which recorded the third respondent's agreement to abide, to the best of his capacity, by the Code of Conduct, which included the undertaking, referred to at [45] above, to ensure that all workers on the Fairy Meadow site were financial members of the relevant union. 59 In relation to the fourth respondent's conduct in contravention of Part XA of the Act, two contraventions were found.
 Once again no evidence has been proffered as to what was said, although one might infer that guidance as to the importance of compliance with the freedom of association provisions was provided. 76 Whether that be the case or not, the serious nature of the contraventions of Part XA of the Act by the first and second respondents and the complicity of those respondents in the contravening conduct of the third and fourth respondents through their provision and use of the 'CFMEU Code of Conduct for Union Delegates' form warrants the imposition of significant penalties against those respondents in respect of their conduct in contravention of Part XA of the Act. 77 Whilst there have been six separate contraventions, each of which could attract a penalty of $10,000, it seems to me that, firstly, the contraventions referred to in [2(e)] and [2(f)] above, and also in [2(h)] and [2(i)] should be addressed on the basis that they arise out of one course of conduct.
 I do not consider that contravening conduct by each of the third and fourth respondents, which simultaneously exposes both the first and second respondents to liability for the same contravening conduct in accordance with s 298B(2) of the Act, renders it appropriate that each of the first and second respondents should suffer the same maximum penalty, if a maximum penalty were, relevantly, in contemplation. 79 Having regard to these matters and to all the circumstances of the case, appropriate penalties would total $10,000 for each of the first and second respondents in respect of their conduct in contravention of Part XA of the Act which has been found to have occurred.
 Whatever other 'matters' may be inherent in the one legal controversy, the present case involved a proceeding in respect of a controversy which arose under the Act, whether the claims for relief be expressed as being made under s 170NC, s 298S(2)(a) or s 298SC(c). 102 Section 347(1) does not allow for separate determinations to be made in respect of costs by reference to different statutory claims arising from the one legal controversy.
