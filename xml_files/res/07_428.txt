 He also said that he had not applied for asylum in the Philippines because he had heard from friends that Australia was a good place for refugee status and he had been bound for Australia. 4 The Tribunal noted that the appellant had produced a number of documents in support of his application, and put to the appellant that many police documents submitted by applicants for asylum were forgeries.
 The Tribunal acted in breach of s 424A by not providing the appellant with particulars of information which was the reason or part of the reason for the decision of the Tribunal, in particular in relation to question 6 of the protection visa (whether the appellant had ever been charged with a criminal offence) referred to by the Tribunal at CB 94.2, and which was used to bolster its conclusion that the appellant did not face false charges and did not fear persecution at CB 104.1 and 105.9. 2.
 The Tribunal failed to discharge its duty in accordance with s 430 of the Act and failed to act in accordance with substantial justice and the merits of the case, in accordance with s 420 of the Act. 15 The submissions of the appellant were in terms however of error by her Honour as to her findings in relation to these grounds.
