 Section 711(5)(c) of the Act requires that if the prospectus for an offer of security states that the securities will be able to be traded on a financial market, the prospectus must state that an application for admission of the securities for quotation on that financial market will be made to the operator of that market within 7 days after the date of the prospectus. 2 The prospectus in this matter was issued by the applicant company Geopacific Resources NL on 22 December 2006 and was lodged with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ("ASIC") on that date.
 In light of s 723(3)(a) and s 724(1)(b)(i) of the Act, the company was under obligation to apply for quotation with the ASX within 7 days of the lodgement date, that is by 29 December 2006. 3 The quotation was in fact lodged on 5 January 2007, being 7 days after the end of the period for application prescribed by the two subsections to which I have referred.
 The purpose of the offer of shares was to enable the company to expand its program of drilling and exploration in response to copper and gold targets that had been generated by work to date done in Fiji, as well as to enable to company to acquire advanced exploration property. 5 Turning to the reason for delay, it emerges from the affidavit of Mr Pringle, a director of Geopacific Resources, that while he was not personally involved in the preparation of the quotation application, he was aware of the need for it, but was unaware of the obligation to lodge it with the ASX within 7 days of lodgement of the prospectus.
 On 5 January he received an email transmission from an official at the ASX which pointed out that the company had not applied to the ASX for quotation of the securities to be issued under the prospectus within the 7 day window. 6 Following receipt of that email, Mr Pringle contacted the company secretary who prepared a quotation application and informed him of the ASX email.
