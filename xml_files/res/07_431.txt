 If a conviction, act or omission of the applicant is not disregarded, it will need to be assessed, along with other factors, in order to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper person if that inquiry can still be made where the disqualifying factors do not apply.
 It may well be that a particular conviction (other than a disqualifying conviction) is to be taken into account and not 'disregarded', but that, for one reason or another, taking into account all the circumstances, the Board may still be satisfied that the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person.
 Accordingly, in my view, ss 85VZ and 85ZW have no application to the circumstances of this case. 31 Finally, other matters were raised by the applicant as to the Tribunal's failure to take into account certain matters, or reach various conclusions, which in my view involve no question or error of law.
 Each of the remaining grounds of the further amended notice of appeal and contentions went to the factual merits of the findings of the Tribunal, although as I have concluded, the Tribunal did not deal with the ultimate issue that needed consideration and determination, but considered the existence of 'special circumstances' for the purposes of applying s 251BC(3) of the Act.
