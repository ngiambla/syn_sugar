 This would be a matter of English law, but I do not understand that there would be any issue about this. 7 There is, however, no specific information (other than the conclusory assertion of the defendant's solicitor) available to the Court, or apparently to the plaintiff, as to whether Planetwide and the defendant contracted on the basis of the United Kingdom Warehousing Association Terms.
 The claim is one under s 4(3)(e) or (f) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) ("a claim for loss of or damage to goods carried by ship or a claim arising out of an agreement that relates to the carriage of goods or persons by a ship...").
 I am not clear as to whether the defendant will assert that there was a direct contract between the plaintiff and it or whether it will be said that on its proper construction the clause is wide enough to extend to non-contractual bailment counts supported by cases such as The 'Pioneer Container' [1994] 2 AC 324.
