 To the best of Mr Maurici's recollection, everyone attending trade school travelled there by private motor vehicle. 16 If an apprentice failed a module at trade school then he or she would have to repeat that module.
 He said that he was given the induction package at the commencement of his apprenticeship, and that he understood that this contained the 'rules' of his employment. 21 Mr Harrison attended trade school at the Technical and Further Education College at Marleston.
 The respondent accepted that there needed to be an approved contract of training under s 41 of the Training and Skills Development Act 2003 (SA) and that if there was not the contract of employment would be frustrated (s 37).
 In my opinion, the statutory and regulatory context of these cases is so different from that under consideration in this case that they are of very little assistance. 42 The applicant submitted that an amendment to the award made on 1 November 2004 supported the interpretation it advanced.
