 In my opinion, the words of the section are such that if the power to defer is exercised, consideration of the application for review must at least commence within a period of twelve months thereafter. 34 The Tribunal's general power to adjourn is not excluded by the fact that the power to defer is a power available to the Tribunal.
 The Tribunal might adjourn because of the unavailability of a party or witness or for any of the reasons that routinely lead to adjournments of a proceeding before a court or tribunal. 35 However, the general power to adjourn is affected by the provisions of the Act.
 What that means is that the power in s 14A was spent because consideration of the application did not at least commence within twelve months of 8 September 2004. 37 The exercise by the Tribunal of its general power to adjourn miscarried because it was not entitled to take into account the pending charge in considering whether to adjourn and, in any event, the Tribunal member misunderstood what would occur if the application was not adjourned.
