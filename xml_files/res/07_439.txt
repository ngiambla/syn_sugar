 I would simply note in passing that at the end of a letter signed by Mr Gray it is described in the following terms: "Corporate Investments: A Sovereign Pure Trust, Private Investment Organisation". 9 On 21 December 2006 Mr Gray drew a further Sight Draft in the amount of US$11,000,000,000 in favour of Gaden Lawyers which was payable to its trust account, "for the benefit of an offer by Corporate Investments arranged by Mr Andrew Garrett of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3".
 To anticipate matters, after a series of exchanges with Qantas' legal advisers, Qantas not only rejected the offer (such had been foreshadowed at the outset), it also indicated it proposed no longer to acknowledge or to respond to his correspondence or telephone calls.
 To that extent I would dismiss his application. 21 In relation to the second Sight Draft, I accept for present purposes that Mr Garrett, in his capacity as trustee of that instrument, has standing to institute proceedings in respect of it.
 He has contended that when Westpac took possession of the second draft on 3 January and provided Mr Garrett with the stamped credit slip, it thereby became the acceptor of the draft (as a bill of exchange) and incurred the liability of an acceptor under s 59 of the Bills of Exchange Act to pay the bill.
