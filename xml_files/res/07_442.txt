 The pharmacist is then free to make the substitution with a generic product and Servier loses the profit on that sale. 25 Servier submits that the purpose of the stamp is to assist a doctor to make a clear and visible statement to the pharmacist that brand substitution is not permitted for Coversyl specifically.
 Servier says that the stamp enables a doctor to indicate that brand substitution is not permitted for Coversyl in circumstances where other medications are prescribed and brand substitution for those medications (but not Coversyl) is permitted.
 Doctors may specify that brand substitution is not permitted to avoid the risk of patients, who may be familiar with the particular package, tablet appearance or dose and may be elderly or cognitively impaired, from being confused upon substitution of the branded product for a generic.
