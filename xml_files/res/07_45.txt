 The Tribunal's proposal to the Court for revised mediation timetables responded to chronic delays in the mediation of native title determination applications in the two regions, in particular in relation to the resolution of overlap issues and the preparation of connection materials by the various applicant groups. 2 The Tribunal had prepared outlines of proposed orders for revised regional mediation protocols.
 I made orders on 21 December 2006 for the parties to convene with the Tribunal in order to formulate precise minutes in respect of the applications in each region in order to give effect to the Tribunal's proposals.
 The directions hearings were otherwise adjourned to 29 June 2007. 3 A meeting was convened between the parties and the Tribunal on 15 January 2007 and on 18 January 2007 a minute of proposed orders was sent in to the Court by the Tribunal for each region.
 After discussions between Deputy Registrar Eaton and the Tribunal a revised version of the minutes was sent in by the Tribunal on 19 January 2007 which made variations to deal with claims involved in more than one overlap management strategy, to make the specific matter numbers more evident and to remove some claims from the revised mediation protocols.
