 1 In reasons for decision published on 21 December 2006 I foreshadowed directions that would be given in respect of native title determinations pending in the Geraldton and Pilbara region and subject to current referrals to the National Native Title Tribunal (the Tribunal) for mediation.
 The Tribunal's proposal to the Court for revised mediation timetables responded to chronic delays in the mediation of native title determination applications in the two regions, in particular in relation to the resolution of overlap issues and the preparation of connection materials by the various applicant groups. 2 The Tribunal had prepared outlines of proposed orders for revised regional mediation protocols.
 After discussions between Deputy Registrar Eaton and the Tribunal a revised version of the minutes was sent in by the Tribunal on 19 January 2007 which made variations to deal with claims involved in more than one overlap management strategy, to make the specific matter numbers more evident and to remove some claims from the revised mediation protocols.
