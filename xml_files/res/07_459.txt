 1 This appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal), pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (the Tribunal Act), concerns the proper construction of s 13(6) of the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992 (Cth) (the Act).
 The Tribunal said that the class is inextricably tied to, and identified by, the amount of its remuneration and must be linked in that way in order for the percentage variation under the provision to be calculated. 15 The Tribunal approached its task by identifying the class to which the Seafarer belonged by reference to the Award and the Award's categorisation of size of vessel and manning.
 For that reason, the Tribunal concluded that the amount of weekly payments to the Seafarer could not be adjusted under s 13(6). 17 The Tribunal rejected the contention on behalf of the Seafarer that the class be identified simply as " catering assistants ".
