 I find that, apart from the obvious typographical error in the third paragraph, the letter is in accordance with the instructions given to Mr Russo and that it says what Mr Russo intended it to say.
 The respondent did not dispute that he had signed this document, but claimed that the circumstances in which it was signed were the subject of ongoing proceedings in a Scottish Court and that in any event the furnishings ought to have been returned to him on payment of the money owing.
 It indicates that when it was signed and when it was filed the respondent believed that he was resident in Australia. 42 Mrs Lee's evidence was quite limited and I have no reason not to accept that she told the truth as she understood it.
