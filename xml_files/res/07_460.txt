 1 On 20 October 2004 George Christopher Wagner and Debra Lees Wagner presented debtors' petitions and shortly afterwards the present applicants Brett Richard Jeffrey Harrison and Paul John Cook were appointed joint trustees of their bankrupt estates. 2 The present application before the Court seeks an order under s 109(10) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) in respect of a reference sought by creditors Roberts Ltd and Monds Affleck Pty Ltd.
 Examinations conducted under s 81 of the Act led the trustees to believe that there were serious doubts as the veracity of the debt, that George Wagner's shares in the Company had not been transferred for market value and that the Alfred and Norma Wagner were aware of the financial difficulties of the bankrupts at the time of the transfer of the shares. 5 In late April 2006 Alfred and Norma Wagner, by their solicitors, offered the trustees the sum of $160,000 plus reasonable legal costs in full and final settlement.
 The other creditors were told of the proposed indemnity but did not join in. 6 After obtaining the indemnity the trustees filed an application in the Federal Court (TAD 29/2006) on 7 August 2006 in relation to the undervalue transfer of the shares and the proof of debt lodged by Alfred and Norma Wagner and the Company. 7 On 8 September 2006 Alfred and Norma Wagner and the Company offered the trustee $260,000, including costs, to settle.
 In the administration of the bankrupt estate of George Wagner, after payment of the costs, expenses and charges incurred by the applicants in the Federal Court of Australia in proceeding TAD29/2006, Roberts Ltd and Monds Affleck Pty Ltd be paid the sum of $65,000 to be shared rateably between them in proportion to their debts and the balance of the proceeds of the realised funds, after payment of costs and expenses of administration with the order of priorities set out in section 109 of the Act. 2.
