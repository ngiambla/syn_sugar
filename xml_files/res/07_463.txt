 On the basis of the same evidence, I find that, after March 2004, the Mod Shop companies offered for sale and sold client card sharing software, which was to be used for the purposes of card sharing activities by the customers of the Mod Shop companies.
 Mr Haddad and Mr Kolker were also based at those premises. 148 Mr Lalli-Cafini deposed that from his discussions with Mr Haddad and observations of Mr Haddad's role, conduct and responsibilities, Mr Haddad was 'the owner and controller of the Mod Shop companies'.
 Mr Lalli-Cafini said that with a 10 meg crystal capacity, he could basically double the volume of customers they could service with the card sharing server. 163 Mr Lalli-Cafini said that Mr Haddad told him to get what he needed to improve the performance of the server.
 The service provided by Mr Kelly, in housing the card sharing server, was an essential element of the business system of the Mod Shop companies, which included selling and offering for sale the card sharing hardware and card sharing software during the card sharing phase of the business activities of the Mod Shop companies.
