 In the 1990s, Mr Lang's spine was operated on several times; some of these operations were paid for by Comcare as compensation for his injury. 9 In 2004 Comcare reviewed Mr Lang's claim and, for that purpose, referred him to a consultant surgeon, Dr Griffith, for examination.
 As mentioned at [9] and [14] --- [17] above, the Tribunal accepted Dr Griffith's evidence. 33 Prima facie, Dr Talbot's report goes to the heart of the issue before the Tribunal, namely, whether Mr Lang was, as at the time of Comcare's decision in 2004, still entitled to compensation for the injury accepted by Comcare in 1984.
 It submits that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to a reconsideration of Comcare's determination and therefore, by ss 60 and 62 of the SRC Act the Tribunal was only entitled to consider Mr Lang's entitlement to compensation for the injury notified and for which liability had been accepted.
 Mr Lang's notice indicated the nature of his injury and its connection to his employment, and is consistent with the concept of injury to which the High Court referred. 48 Comcare's determination in 1984 that accepted liability for Mr Lang's injury made no mention of the circumstances in which the injury was incurred, save to say that it was in the course of Mr Lang's employment.
