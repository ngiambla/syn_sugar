 In the 1990s, Mr Lang's spine was operated on several times; some of these operations were paid for by Comcare as compensation for his injury. 9 In 2004 Comcare reviewed Mr Lang's claim and, for that purpose, referred him to a consultant surgeon, Dr Griffith, for examination.
 As mentioned at [9] and [14] --- [17] above, the Tribunal accepted Dr Griffith's evidence. 33 Prima facie, Dr Talbot's report goes to the heart of the issue before the Tribunal, namely, whether Mr Lang was, as at the time of Comcare's decision in 2004, still entitled to compensation for the injury accepted by Comcare in 1984.
