 The Applicant claims to fear persecution by the LTTE because she left them, and/or because the LTTE may think that she gave information about them to the Sri Lankan authorities, or because they regard her as a traitor or because she broke her promise to stay with the LTTE, or because they thought she had joined Karuna.
 Furthermore, given that the ceasefire has been in place for three years now, and the LTTE is well established as the controlling authority in some parts of the Vanni where the Applicant lived, the Tribunal does not accept as plausible that the LTTE would try to find her and persecute her so that she doesn't give the authorities information about them or identify them.
