 It said: 'Although some of the Applicant's oral evidence is inconsistent and unclear, and some of her written account is difficult to follow chronologically, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Applicant is a witness of credit and that the ambiguities and confusion in her evidence was due to her overwhelming feeling of depression and hopelessness when she had to re-live her experiences by giving an account of her situation. ' 6 The appellant had claimed a fear of persecution from both LTTE and Sri Lankan security forces.
 The Applicant claims to fear persecution by the LTTE because she left them, and/or because the LTTE may think that she gave information about them to the Sri Lankan authorities, or because they regard her as a traitor or because she broke her promise to stay with the LTTE, or because they thought she had joined Karuna.
 Furthermore, given that the ceasefire has been in place for three years now, and the LTTE is well established as the controlling authority in some parts of the Vanni where the Applicant lived, the Tribunal does not accept as plausible that the LTTE would try to find her and persecute her so that she doesn't give the authorities information about them or identify them.
 She has had to fend for herself and raise her two children since her husband abandoned her in LTTE territory in 1988 and she successfully protected both children from forced recruitment into the LTTE by getting them away from LTTE dominated areas, but at great emotional and financial cost to them all.
