 BUCHANAN J: 1 The sole ground for this application for leave to appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court is that the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the RRT') should have provided to the applicant, for his comment, his own visa application. 2 The applicant arrived in Australian on 20 December 2005.
 From May 2003 to December 2004 my network successfully transported and distributed thousands of copies of Bibles and religious promotion materials to the underground churches in south China areas and regions. 9 Our operation was so successful until 10 March 2005 when I received a phone call from Mr [Y], telling me that his distant relative Mr [A] was caught by the PSB in Shenzhen as he gathered some members to study the Bible at his dormitory, which was searched by the police and some of Bibles and religious materials were discovered.
 On 27 November 2006 Driver FM dismissed the application for judicial review pursuant to Rule 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court rules for the reason that it disclosed no arguable case of jurisdictional error.
