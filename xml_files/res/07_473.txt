 Alternatively, they sought an order that the statement of claim be struck out on the grounds that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. 3 At a directions hearing on 30 January 2007 I ordered that the applicants file and serve an amended statement of claim on or before 20 February 2007 and that the directors file and serve revised submissions in relation to their strike out motion by 27 February 2007.
 The applicants say that Clifton Partners engaged in conduct which was misleading or deceptive contrary to s 995(2) of the Corporations Law and that the first to fifth applicants are entitled to recover the amount of any loss or damage caused by that conduct. 14 The remaining applicants each plead misleading or deceptive conduct in respect of successive prospectuses issued on 11 February 2000, 13 March 2000, 11 May 2000 and 15 May 2000.
 These breaches relate to their alleged failure to provide, or cause KMF to provide, any or any adequate training to staff members of Clifton Partners to ensure that they understood the requirements placed on them under the Corporations Law and the Compliance Plan in various respects.
 They did so in reliance upon the six representations conveyed by the Clifton Partners' letter of 14 February 2000 and as a result of the directors' breaches of the duties imposed on them by s 601FD of the Corporations Law and as a result of their negligence.
