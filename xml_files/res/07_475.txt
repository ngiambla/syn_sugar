 1 The present proceedings came before this Court by way of purported appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 4 December 2006, whereby it was held by Senior Member Isenberg that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under s 25 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) to hear and address the applicant's complaints.
 He was not accompanied by any of his children on either occasion. 3 Mr Kunc explained to the Court on that earlier occasion that the applicant held many grievances against public authorities and that the Tribunal had been unable to identify those grievances as having been caused by the conduct of any relevant Commonwealth instrumentality falling within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.
 Mr Kunc and Ms Pownall made an application on behalf of their respective clients, then being second and third respondents to the proceeding, that they should cease to be parties to the proceeding, since they were not parties to the original proceeding before the Tribunal.
