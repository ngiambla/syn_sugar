 The letter included the following statement: "Pursuant to Article 20(3) of the Agreement, our client hereby notifies Hume Computers and Hume Business of its intention to terminate the Agreement with effect on and from 31 March 2007. " 5 There is evidence before me that the letter was delivered by hand to the offices of the solicitors on 22 December 2006.
 The first is whether there is any onus upon Exact to prove that the notice was effective under Dutch law. 8 The second issue is whether a notice not issued by Exact, but by its solicitors, was a valid notice. 9 The third issue is whether a notice not sent to either Hume Computers or Hume Business, but to its solicitors, was effective. 10 The fourth question is whether the letter contained an unequivocal statement of Exact's election to terminate. 11 The fifth question is whether the letter, considered as a whole, constituted a repudiation of the Distributorship Agreement by Exact. 12 If these questions are determined adversely to the Hume companies, they contend that a condition should be imposed on the discharge of the injunctions and release of the undertakings.
 It approves Mr Hambrett's draft letter to Hume' lawyers. 19 There is no other inference apart from the obvious one that Exact conferred actual authority on Baker McKenzie to give notice of termination in the terms stated in the letter of 22 December 2006. 20 Nothing in Article 20(3) of the Distributorship Agreement, or any other article, prescribes the method by which notices are to be given.
 Mr Leathem is the managing director of Hume Computers and a director and shareholder of Hume Business Solutions. 42 The expression "matters arising" is a broad one and is to be considered in the light of the subject matter of the letter of 20 January 2006 which demanded undertakings from Exact Software Australia prior to the institution of these proceedings. 43 It is also to be considered in light of the plain fact that Home Wilkinson Lowry are acting as solicitors for the Hume companies in the present proceedings, notwithstanding that no costs agreement has been produced relating to any such retainer.
