 The Tribunal is accordingly not satisfied that the applicant faced or faces persecution in China because of his association with his Church activity. ' 8 The RRT also dealt with claims that the appellant had been 'forced to go into hiding for six to seven years in the Chinese Provinces of Hernan and Hubei' but found: 'By the applicant's own admission, he was also employed in these Provinces as a plasterer, and worked for a brief period at a petrol station.
 The evidence leads the Tribunal to conclude that the applicant moved to the two Provinces in search of work, and not to hide from the authorities because of his association with his church. ' 9 The RRT found, as a result: 'The claims by the applicant do not disclose a credible basis to conclude that he was subject to persecution in China.
 The Tribunal is accordingly not satisfied that the applicant faced persecution in China because of Christian beliefs or that he faces persecution in China if he returns to that country. ' 10 All the findings to which I have referred were made by the RRT as a result of its consideration of the appellant's evidence to it.
 However, letters to the appellant dated 24 January 2006 (informing him that his application for review had been received) and 25 January 2006 (inviting him to a hearing before the RRT) both clearly informed him of his opportunity to provide to the RRT any documents upon which he wished to rely. 22 He said also that he only received a letter about the hearing the day before it occurred.
