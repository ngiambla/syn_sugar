 In an effort to further stabilise the structure and meet those problems he developed a stabilisation bar, but it added complexity to the structure and increased its weight and manufacturing costs.
 He identified a need to simplify: 'the mounting of the scissor bar elements, one to another into scissor units and the resulting scissor units into interconnected scissor or truss assemblies, and in the connection of such truss assemblies in a pivotal expandable/collapsible manner to respective corner and intermediate supports.
 The essential element is claimed to be the presence of planar contact surfaces on the sidewalls. 39 Mr McKinnon did not consider that the inclined side and rib of Product B provided a planar contact surface.
