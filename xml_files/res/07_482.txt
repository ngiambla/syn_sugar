 He admitted that his original explanation was speculation based on a misapprehension of the circumstances. 34 On 12 October 2006 the applicant's solicitor swore and filed an affidavit deposing to ASIC searches of the directorships that the first plaintiff has held.
 The first plaintiff said he knew during his time as a company director over the past 20 years that there was a responsibility to ensure that a company lodged returns and other documents with ASIC.
 However, the first plaintiff agreed that he had not sought to reregister any of the other companies that had become deregistered. 41 The applicant said that he did not engage his accountants to maintain the company records, nor did they prepare financial statements for the companies.
