 The Tribunal's reasoning is summarised in the following paragraphs: However, in relation to the review applicant's academic results, Monash University confirmed that the review applicant did not meet course requirements in semesters 1 and 2 of 2003 and that her enrolment had been terminated due to academic reasons.
 She submits that the statement in the letter that the information is relevant to the review because it may be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review was insufficient to comply with that requirement.
 I therefore failed four out of four subjects in the first semester and failed three out of four subjects in second semester of 2003. 25 I reject the first respondent's argument that the obligation in s 359A(1) did not arise because the information was information the appellant gave for the purpose of the application.
