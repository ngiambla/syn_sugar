 The first respondent makes a cross-claim against the applicant in which it alleges that, in breach of the distribution agreement, the applicant failed to pay the first respondent certain moneys owing to the first respondent. 18 The relevant orders in the amended notice of motion seek judgment for damages to be assessed on the cause of action based on the alleged contravention of s 51AD of the Trade Practices Act .
 The applicant said that in lieu of the orders in the amended notice of motion, it sought by way of summary judgment a declaration that the first respondent has contravened s 51AD of the Trade Practices Act and a declaration that the second respondent is a person who aided, abetted, counselled or procured or induced or was directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in the contravention of s 51AD by the first respondent. 19 The respondents opposed the applicant's application to further amend its notice of motion in this way.
 In my opinion it is not appropriate to grant a declaration of a contravention of the provision of the Trade Practices Act on an application for summary judgment unless the case is a particularly clear one and the other circumstances suggest that it is an appropriate case to do so.
