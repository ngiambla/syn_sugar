 The respondents, if successful, could find themselves with a costs order in their favour which they are unable to enforce. 3 The provision of security is rarely, if ever, a complete indemnity against the risk faced by respondents and needs to be pitched at some level which involves a reasonable recognition of the competing interests.
 In this case the respondents have provided evidence, which is not contested, of costs estimates on a party-party basis with two different figures dependent upon whether the proceedings are to go ahead in Perth or in the Brisbane registry of the Court.
 While ordinarily the docket judge will hear the trial of the action which he or she has been managing, it is not unusual for there to be cases in which the trial is allocated to another judge for reasons of convenience.
 Those are all case management matters which can be dealt with in due course. 12 Although this proceeding, in terms of the location of the respondents, might broadly be called a Queensland case from the respondents' point of view, it is not inherently a Brisbane case.
