 In fact, specific reference is made to Ms Saunders' past conduct, going back, it seems, to 2003. 15 I again stress that all allegations are denied by Ms Saunders, and that obviously it is not sufficient to simply rely upon allegations of criminal conduct against a legal practitioner as the sole basis for the court making a restraining order.
 Without going into all the elements of the allegations made by the applicant against Ms Saunders, the conclusion I have reached is based upon Ms Saunders' own evaluation as evidenced by and in the course of her application before me not to be cross-examined on the basis of the privilege of self-incrimination.
