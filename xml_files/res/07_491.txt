 In Bowen v Stott [2004] WASC 94 at [53] and [55], Hasluck J said that it may be appropriate to invoke this power in cases where the legal practitioner may feel compelled to justify or defend his or her conduct in representing a client, or where the practitioner's credibility is at stake as a potential witness. 14 I have not reached the conclusion that there is a real likelihood that the conduct of Ms Saunders will require evaluation in these proceeding just because the applicant has made a number of serious allegations against Ms Saunders.
 In the course of an application made on Ms Saunders' behalf that Ms Saunders be excused from cross-examination on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination, counsel for Ms Saunders stated that the application to remove Ms Saunders from acting in these proceedings was based upon, and inextricably linked with, the very allegations of criminal conduct alleged against her, and that it was clear from the material before the Court that the applicant intended to pursue these criminal charges.
 In fact, specific reference is made to Ms Saunders' past conduct, going back, it seems, to 2003. 15 I again stress that all allegations are denied by Ms Saunders, and that obviously it is not sufficient to simply rely upon allegations of criminal conduct against a legal practitioner as the sole basis for the court making a restraining order.
 Without going into all the elements of the allegations made by the applicant against Ms Saunders, the conclusion I have reached is based upon Ms Saunders' own evaluation as evidenced by and in the course of her application before me not to be cross-examined on the basis of the privilege of self-incrimination.
