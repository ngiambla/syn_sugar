 I consider that those words were surplus, and should be ignored. 11 I raised these concerns with the parties on 28 March 2007, and indicated to them that I considered that, as a matter of law, the proceeding had not been discontinued, and remained on foot.
 However, under O 62 r 3(3) --- An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceeding in which the interlocutory order was made is concluded or further order.
 The plaintiff had an established entitlement to its costs pursuant to orders made in the interlocutory stages of the proceeding, and I consider that, if the parties proposed that that right would be extinguished, clearer words than the general ones contained in clause 4 of the terms would have been required.
