 The Commission may issue a Part A competition notice where the Commission has ' reason to believe ' that the carrier or carriage service provider has engaged, or is engaging, in an instance of anti-competitive conduct (for a s 151AKA(1) notice) or at least one instance of a kind of anti-competitive conduct (for a s 151AKA(2) notice) (s 151AKA(7) and (8)).
 Anti-competitive conduct occurs, in substance, where the carrier or carriage service provider has a substantial degree of power in a telecommunications market and takes advantage of that power, or takes advantage of that power and engages in other conduct, with the effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in that or any other telecommunications market (s 151AJ(2)).
 This means, Telstra contends, that the Commission is obliged to specify a kind of anti-competitive conduct in the Consultation Notice and then allege, in the Competition Notice, that the carrier or provider has engaged in at least one instance of anti-competitive conduct of that kind.
