 One of the matters is the ongoing discussions with representatives of one of the secured creditors, with a view to attempting to ensure that there will be a dividend paid to the general unsecured creditors of Central Norseman Gold Corporation Limited. 7 The deed administrators have already exercised the power in para 4.1.3 of the deeds, to extend the time for the issue of the reports by obtaining the written consent of the secured creditors.
 Mr Smith expects that within that period of time he and Mr Hughes will be able to comply with their obligation to issue the reports. 8 It is well established that s 447A of the Act can be used to vary a deed of company arrangement ( Mulvaney v Rob Wintulich Pty Ltd (1995) 60 FCR 81; Re Pasminco Limited (No 2) (2004) 49 ACSR 470). 9 Mr Smith has deposed that the secured creditors have both been appraised of this application and have agreed to the orders that are proposed.
 I have been advised from the Bar table that all of the members of the committee of creditors of Central Norseman Gold Corporation Limited, who have been able to be contacted, also agree with the orders proposed. 10 It will not be possible to convene meetings of creditors of the companies, for the purpose of amending the deeds of company arrangement, prior to the expiry of the deadline.
 Secondly, the creditors will be better informed when it comes to voting on the proposal which will be put by the deed administrators. 12 Accordingly, I will make orders in terms of the application, save that the costs of photocopying the annexures to the Share Sale Agreement being exhibit "VAS3" to the affidavit of Mr Smith sworn 31 January 2007, which were voluminous but unnecessary for this application, should be borne by the plaintiffs' solicitors and not by the creditors.
