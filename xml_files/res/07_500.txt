 They successfully sought an order that Newpage be wound up and that Mr Hamilton, whom they had previously appointed as receiver and manager of Newpage under a security held by them, be appointed as liquidator of Newpage. 6 Mr Yii is the sole director and secretary of Newpage.
 Of that sum, Newpage paid two amounts of $610,000 and $1,527,000 (totalling $2,137,000) to the first respondent to the interlocutory process, Casino Busters International Pty Ltd ('CBI'), of which Mr Parsons is the sole director and shareholder. 7 On various bases Newpage and Mr Hamilton contend that Mr Yii is liable to reimburse Newpage in respect of those two amounts totalling $2,137,000.
 Lewis gave Newpage and Mr Yii notice in writing of the assignment. 14 Newpage and Mr Yii defaulted under the Loan Facility Agreement, and on 29 December 2006, Elderslie and Mr George appointed Mr Hamilton as receiver and manager of the property of Newpage. 15 Mr Hamilton's investigations as receiver and manager suggested that Newpage's major asset was 30,788,751 shares in the capital of Intermoco Limited ('Intermoco'), a public company whose shares were listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
 The interlocutory process also sought an order that Mr Parsons file and serve an affidavit disclosing the facts and circumstances under which the sums of $610,000 and $1,527,000 were received by CBI from Newpage on 1 June and 22 September 2006 respectively, and as to any disposition or use by CBI or Mr Parsons of those amounts, and their present whereabouts.
 He estimates that during his association with Mr Yii, the total sum provided by Mr Yii to him for blackjack gaming exceeded $10 million. 25 Mr Parsons used the amounts at various casinos in Australia and abroad, namely, Crown Melbourne, Jupiters Queensland, and Belaggios, MGM Grand and Wynns Casinos, all in Las Vegas, USA.
 Mr Parsons states: 'These funds were for the purpose of blackjack gaming'. 32 Mr Parsons has inspected the CBI Westpac trading account for the period 22 September to 24 November 2006 and identifies five withdrawals totalling $1,592,333.00 which he states were used for blackjack gaming. 33 Mr Parsons states (para 16): 'To the best of my knowledge and recollection Mr Yii received the return of all of his capital and a percentage of the winnings depending on the amount of the winnings.
 The letter advised that the solicitors were unaware of 'the interplay' between Newpage and Penthouse and that neither of those companies was a client of the firm. 60 I will not digress to attempt to reconcile the solicitors' letter to Mr Hamilton with Exhibits MYHY 1, 2, 3 and 5, discussed earlier.
