 On 5 January 2007, her Honour appointed Mr Hamilton as provisional liquidator of Newpage (see Elderslie Finance Corporation Limited v Newpage Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 4). 20 On 24 January 2007, Elderslie and Mr George filed an interlocutory process against CBI as first respondent and Mr Parsons as second respondent seeking freezing orders against CBI up to a sum of $2,137,000.
 He estimates that during his association with Mr Yii, the total sum provided by Mr Yii to him for blackjack gaming exceeded $10 million. 25 Mr Parsons used the amounts at various casinos in Australia and abroad, namely, Crown Melbourne, Jupiters Queensland, and Belaggios, MGM Grand and Wynns Casinos, all in Las Vegas, USA.
 The letter advised that the solicitors were unaware of 'the interplay' between Newpage and Penthouse and that neither of those companies was a client of the firm. 60 I will not digress to attempt to reconcile the solicitors' letter to Mr Hamilton with Exhibits MYHY 1, 2, 3 and 5, discussed earlier.
