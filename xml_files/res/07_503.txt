 BACKGROUND 11 The applicant is considering commencing proceedings against the respondent pursuant to s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 and/or applying for leave to commence and, subsequently, commencing proceedings in the name of the respondent against Mr Gilmour pursuant to ss 236 and 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 .
 The applicant did not accept this offer. 24 Mr Gilmour concedes that there were negotiations during which he told the applicant that he was prepared to pay him $200,000 subject to a restrictive covenant concerning his dealings in Kalgoorlie but that the applicant wanted $350,000 net of tax and with no clauses restraining him from approaching the respondent's customers.
 He asserts that they were calculated according to rates that the respondent was advised by its accountant Mr Tony Armenti as being lawful and appropriate to charge. 40 Mr Armenti's affidavit asserts that the management fees are calculated by reference to a portion of the electricity, rates and taxes, rent, stationery, postage, wages, staff amenities, telephone and managing director fees that were paid by Sola-Kleen.
 The 2004 tax returns (especially page 62 of Mr Armenti's affidavit and page 82 of the applicant' s 9 November affidavit) and the 2005 tax returns (especially page 68 of Mr Armenti's affidavit and 89 of the applicant' s 9 November 2006 affidavit) each record the respondent's expenses and profits consistently with the 2005 financial statements contained within the same affidavit --- i.e. the tax returns annexed to the applicant' s 9 November 2006 affidavit record the same expenses and profits as the 2005 financial statements annexed to the applicant' s 9 November 2006 affidavit and the tax returns annexed to Mr Armenti's affidavit record the same expenses and profit as the 2005 financial statements annexed to Mr Armenti's affidavit. 48 The 2005 financial statements annexed to Mr Armenti's affidavit are dated 17 January 2006 (page 53) and the 2005 financial statements annexed to the applicant' s 9 November 2006 affidavit are dated 14 February 2006 (page 74).
