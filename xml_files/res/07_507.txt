 The judgments for which he waited were that of Nicholson J in Duncan v Hotop [2004] FCA 274 delivered 22 March 2004; and my judgments in Duncan v Fayle [2004] FCA 723 and Duncan v Administrative Appeals Tribunal (No 2) [2004] FCA 1258.
 I allowed Mr Duncan's appeal against that decision on the basis that an application under the ADJR Act could not be treated as frivolous and vexatious merely because of the existence of an alternative remedy under section 44 of the AAT Act.
