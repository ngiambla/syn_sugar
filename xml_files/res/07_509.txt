 Federal Magistrate Lindsay referred to the Federal Court that part of the application which concerned the proposed decision of Mr Macks to abandon the appeals from the primary judgment. 8 Mr Moore has appealed from the decision of Lindsay FM of 27 April 2006.
 His Honour also concluded that there were no communications between Mr Macks and Mr Moore which provided any basis for the Court to infer that Mr Macks had some significant animosity towards Mr Moore.
 Mr Moore himself, being bankrupt, had no direct role or responsibility in deciding whether they should be prosecuted. 41 Before referring to the reasons for judgment of Besanko J, I note that Wilson and Lawton were the applicants in the primary action.
 They simply order some security for costs to protect Mr Macks if the appeals do proceed and are dismissed. 53 Accordingly, I make the following orders on the notice of motion in appeal SAD 84/2006. 5.
