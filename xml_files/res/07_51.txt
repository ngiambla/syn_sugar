 Ms Symon submitted that, properly understood, the opening timing differences were in the nature of an adjustment, and should be regarded as corresponding with the equivalent closing timing differences which had been deducted to obtain the fiscal income of the partnership at the end of 30 June 1997.
 By s 90 of the 1936 Act, the "net income" of a partnership is --- ...the assessable income of the partnership, calculated as if the partnership were a taxpayer who was a resident, less all allowable deductions ... except certain deductions not presently material.
 However, since work-in-progress is not income for the purposes of taxation law, when calculating the figure that will be returned as the income of the partnership under s 91 of the 1936 Act, Deloittes takes the value of work-in-progress out of the accounting income figure.
