 In my view Arrive Wealth Management's costs should be reduced by a factor that takes into account the time taken in pursuing claims in which it failed, particularly its claim in damages.
 I am still minded to take that course notwithstanding the strong submissions made by the plaintiffs that Ms Harkness should only recover costs on a party and party basis.
