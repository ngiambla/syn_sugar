 In my view Arrive Wealth Management's costs should be reduced by a factor that takes into account the time taken in pursuing claims in which it failed, particularly its claim in damages.
 In all the circumstances it is reasonable, in my opinion, to reduce Arrive Wealth Management's costs by 25 per cent. 7 The claim against Ms Harkness gives rise to different considerations.
 I am still minded to take that course notwithstanding the strong submissions made by the plaintiffs that Ms Harkness should only recover costs on a party and party basis.
 I trust the order will discourage other litigants from bringing hopeless actions. 8 There will be orders that Ms Manning pay 75 per cent of Arrive Wealth Management's costs and that the plaintiffs pay Ms Harkness' costs on a solicitor client basis.
