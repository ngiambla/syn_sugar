 No further order was sought from the Court prior to the date of dismissal on 2 November 2006 and as a consequence of this inaction the order came into force. 10 On 15 November 2006 the State was informed by the Deputy District Registrar that the matter was dismissed as of 2 November 2006 in accordance with the orders of 26 April 2006.
 On 13 December 2006 Drakopoulos Black Solicitors filed a Notice of Motion seeking to have the applications reinstated and this was supported by an Affidavit by Mr Black sworn on 27 November 2006 and other supporting material. 11 The issues raised involve the following questions: (a) Who has authority to bring the motion; (b) Whether the Court has jurisdiction to make the orders sought; and (c) What factors are relevant to the exercise of discretion in the event that jurisdiction is established.
 Notwithstanding this indication the applicant remained legally represented on the record by QSNTS until the applications were dismissed on 2 November 2006. 13 Mr Black has filed an Affidavit attaching a copy of an authority of 4 November 2006, which was two days after the dismissal, confirming that his firm had been appointed to represent the Kullilli applicant.
