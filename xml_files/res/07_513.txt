 Of course, once election inquiries concerning the correctness of the returning officer's actions in rejecting certain nominations and accepting others are over, it is necessary for the elections to be resumed, and in many cases that involves the conduct of ballots for various offices.
 The orders I made were simply orders that lead to the taking of those uncompleted steps on particular bases, namely that certain persons were to be regarded as candidates for certain offices, and certain persons were to be regarded as not being candidates for certain offices.
 I should say that, to the extent to which the orders have been sought, they have not been sought by reference to any admissible evidence, but only by reference to assertions of fact from the bar table, some of which are controversial as between the parties. 8 Counsel for the Union advanced his argument in favour of the making of the orders on the basis that they were orders for both the proper and efficient conduct of the elections.
 Once they do so, there is the possibility that someone may decide to seek leave to appeal from that judgment and may also seek a stay of the orders that I have made, or perhaps some other form of interlocutory orders that would have an effect on the conduct of the ballots.
