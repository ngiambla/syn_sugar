 No error has been, or could be, shown in that conclusion. 16 Despite the limited ground of challenge in his amended application for judicial review, and the fact that, by that amended application, he had effectively abandoned any allegation of bias, at the hearing before Emmett FM the appellant gave voice to such an allegation.
 As earlier discussed, it was not required to be put to the appellant for his comment. 22 At the hearing of the appeal the appellant, through an interpreter, in effect, repeated the matters set out in the Notice of Appeal but added as well that the RRT was biased.
 He was shown a copy of a letter addressed to him dated 28 February 2007 from solicitors for the first respondent telling him of the time and place of the hearing of the appeal and stating that a copy of the written submissions were attached thereto.
