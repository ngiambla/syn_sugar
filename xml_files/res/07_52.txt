 Schedule D to the 2006 certified agreement provided for a disciplinary procedure which was different to that contained in Sch D of the 2004 certified agreement. 7 The University's position was that, whilst it intended, in effect to abandon the proceedings before the Committee, that was established in February 2006, it, nevertheless, intended to deal with the allegations of misconduct against the applicant under the 2006 certified agreement.
 The University counterclaimed for a declaration that on the proper construction of the 2006 certified agreement, all allegations of misconduct against the applicant must be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Sch D of the 2006 certified agreement. 8 The admissions made by the University narrowed the range of issues left in dispute.
 The University contended that, upon the proper construction of cl 6.6.1 of Sch D of the 2006 certified agreement, 'disciplinary proceedings' are commenced when a 'properly appointed' Academic Member of Executive under the 2004 certified agreement chooses to refer the matter to a Misconduct Investigation Committee in accordance with cl 9.2 of the 2004 certified agreement, and that any allegation of misconduct that has not been the subject of deliberations by a 'properly convened' Misconduct Investigation Committee prior to 26 May 2006, must be dealt with in accordance with the 2006 certified agreement.
