 1 These reasons concern claims for costs by the First and Second Respondents/Cross Claimants, the University of Melbourne and Recaldent Pty Ltd ("the University parties") against the Applicant/First Cross Respondent and the Second to Fifth Cross Respondents ("the NSI parties") and the Sixth to Eighth Cross Respondents ("the Probiotec parties").
 They seek these costs on the basis that the First to Eighth Cross Respondents are jointly and severally liable for the costs incurred by the University parties. 6 On Monday 19 March 2007 I made unopposed orders against two of the NSI parties (the Second Cross Respondent, Topocal Pty Ltd, and the Fourth Cross Respondent, Pacific Biolink Pty Ltd) in relation the cross claims for infringement, revocation and unjustified threats.
 Accordingly, this means that the effect of the undertaking is not just interlocutory, but rather final and perpetual. 19 Finally, the Probiotec parties say that the invalidity issue was not raised by them, but rather in the cross claim by the NSI parties.
 I am also satisfied that the way in which the proceedings were conducted, and having regard to the Defence they filed, demonstrates that the Probiotec parties put the University parties to proof on their claims of infringement and denied the validity of the Complex patent.
