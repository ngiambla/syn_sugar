 Pursuant to Order 6 rule 8(1), alternatively Order 6 rule 17, alternatively Order 53 rule 5(3) of the Federal Court Rules , that the Tribunal: (a) be joined as a respondent to the proceeding; (b) alternatively be granted leave to intervene in the proceeding. 2.
 It invited discussion not on possible contravention by the applicant of reg 4.15 of the SIS Regs but in assisting the Tribunal in identifying all possible issues and gathering all relevant information before the matter (the respondent's complaint) was listed for a review determination.
 While the applicant has been successful in having the Tribunal's determination set aside and, in lieu thereof, the respondent's complaint to the Tribunal dismissed, by virtue of the provisions of subs 46(5) of the Complaints Act and what was said at [20] above, there can be no costs order against the respondent.
 It seems clear that the Tribunal would not have sought leave of the Court to intervene after the initial hearing but for the applicant seeking and being granted leave on that day to amend its appeal by the addition of grounds (g) to (j) inclusive.
