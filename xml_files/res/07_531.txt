 The first applicant and the second applicants (other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd) wish to have the quantum of the second applicants' claims, if they succeed on liability, determined after all other issues and questions in the proceeding (being all applicants' claims on liability and the quantum of the first applicant's claim, if it succeeds on liability) have been determined.
 Mr Solomon contends that it is appropriate to make this calculation after an assessment of the damages, if any, payable to Meadow Springs and concurrently with any directions the Court may give concerning the application of damages awarded to Meadow Springs. 8 Mr Solomon submits that any additional issues surrounding the quantum of the second applicants' claims will not require much evidence.
 A Court should not act otherwise than judicially and in good conscience simply to rubber stamp an agreement between those with an interest in litigation. 10 This is not an appropriate case to split the trial in the manner proposed by the first applicant and the second applicants (other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd).
 The first applicant and the second applicants (other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd) have not discharged the onus of proving that the course proposed is just or convenient so as to displace the usual position that all issues and questions in a trial should be dealt with at the same time.
