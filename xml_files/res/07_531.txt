 The first applicant and the second applicants (other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd) wish to have the quantum of the second applicants' claims, if they succeed on liability, determined after all other issues and questions in the proceeding (being all applicants' claims on liability and the quantum of the first applicant's claim, if it succeeds on liability) have been determined.
 Put simply, the critical issue is whether the respondent provided false and misleading valuations which caused the first applicant and certain of its shareholders (the second applicants) to suffer considerable financial loss with respect to a failed resort development. 3 The course proposed by the first applicant and the second applicants (other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd) is unusual.
 If that is the case, it appears to me that little time and expense will be saved by splitting the trial. 9 The primary reason for this application concerns an agreement between the liquidator of Meadow Springs and a receiver and manager (Mr G Carrello) purportedly appointed by a creditor about the representation of Meadow Springs at the trial.
 A Court should not act otherwise than judicially and in good conscience simply to rubber stamp an agreement between those with an interest in litigation. 10 This is not an appropriate case to split the trial in the manner proposed by the first applicant and the second applicants (other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd).
 The first applicant and the second applicants (other than Kids Holdings Pty Ltd) have not discharged the onus of proving that the course proposed is just or convenient so as to displace the usual position that all issues and questions in a trial should be dealt with at the same time.
