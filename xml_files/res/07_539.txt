 It recorded the intent of the respondent to make a collective agreement to which s 423 of the Act applies with "the other negotiating parties" stated to be the applicant and two other unions namely the AMWU and the CEPU.
 If s 423 has the effect for which CSBP contends then those other unions do not in fact become "negotiating parties" (in the particular bargaining period initiated by the giving of the notice) notwithstanding that they are named as "negotiating parties" in the notice.
 However, it does not automatically follow that the notice thereby becomes invalid or otherwise ineffective in initiating a bargaining period to which the employer and notifying union are negotiating parties. [17] (Emphasis added) Section 423(3) specifies how the bargaining period is initiated.
