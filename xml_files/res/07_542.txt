 To that end he ordered that Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd pay to ASIC $28.5 million and for ASIC to distribute the fund on a pro rata basis to non-rescinding shareholders.
 A later order provided for the fund to be established by Newmont Australia Limited (previously Normandy Mining Limited) either on its own behalf or on behalf of Edensor Nominees. 4 In due course the fund was established by Newmont Australia.
 That company will undertake that if a non-rescinding shareholder turns up before 3 January 2009 and seeks payment of the amount due to him Newmont will pay the amount. 6 In my view there is power to make the order sought.
