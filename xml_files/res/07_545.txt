 Based upon my examination of the OMI syringes and my knowledge of the RTI Confidential Information, there are a number of confidential aspects relating to the materials used in RTI's syringes that I am concerned are present in the OMI syringes; however, mere examination of the syringes is not sufficient to determine if the RTI Confidential Information was used or disclosed in relation to the production of the syringes.
 It took RTI a significant amount of time and resources to test various polymers to determine which one has the most favourable characteristics for use in syringes, including the physical and optical properties of the moulded part as well as the extent of leeching from the plastic into fluid used in the syringe; (b) the specified needle lubricant containing solvent and disperant.
