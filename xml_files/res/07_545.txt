 The letter of 5 October 2004 noted the acquisition by OMI of retractable needles through a 'commonly owned or controlled Affiliate of Double Dove [DDGCL]'; noted RTI's exclusive manufacturing agreement with Double Dove; drew attention to the commitment of Double Dove not to manufacture needle product utilising automated retraction technology of any type for any entity other than RTI; noted the disclosure of RTI's confidential information to Double Dove and advised OMI that RTI would take appropriate proceedings to protect its position against any relevant entity. 54 On 15 October 2004, OMI's solicitors responded and requested copies of the agreement in order to properly respond to the letter of 5 October 2004.
 Based upon my examination of the OMI syringes and my knowledge of the RTI Confidential Information, there are a number of confidential aspects relating to the materials used in RTI's syringes that I am concerned are present in the OMI syringes; however, mere examination of the syringes is not sufficient to determine if the RTI Confidential Information was used or disclosed in relation to the production of the syringes.
 It took RTI a significant amount of time and resources to test various polymers to determine which one has the most favourable characteristics for use in syringes, including the physical and optical properties of the moulded part as well as the extent of leeching from the plastic into fluid used in the syringe; (b) the specified needle lubricant containing solvent and disperant.
