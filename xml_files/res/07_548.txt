 The Deputy Commissioner says this is not so. 7 It is accepted on both sides that the court only has jurisdiction to wind up a company in insolvency if the company is insolvent.
 In the case of an application relying on a statutory demand, the court presumes the company is insolvent if it fails to comply with the statutory demand: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) s 459C(2)(a).
 In this connection I was told of a practice that has developed by which a company wishing to prove its solvency must produce audited accounts that evidence solvency.
