 The plaintiff seeks these costs on a solicitor and client basis. 7 Here it is necessary to consider what are the duties of an administrator on receipt of a proof.
 The risk was that if the plaintiff did better than his offer, he might have his costs taxed on a special basis. 9 In my view the plaintiff is entitled to his costs up to 11 October 2006 taxed on a party and party basis and thereafter on a solicitor and client basis.
 That should only occur in the case of misconduct or negligence and I do not think that the administrator is guilty of either. 10 There was some discussion whether the plaintiff's costs should be reduced for him having lost certain points that he had put forward in support of his appeal.
