 An order that the First Respondent and/or Second Respondent forthwith deliver to the Applicant, Jeremy Jones, a written statement of apology, signed by the Second Respondent, in the following terms: "I hereby unreservedly and unconditionally apologise to you and to the Australian Jewish community for having published materials inciting hatred against the Jewish people in contravention of the Racial Discrimination Act .
 It was the applicant's further case, as I have also foreshadowed, that Mr Grigor-Scott was the instigator and controller of the conduct complained of, and further that the written material thus described by the applicant as offensive did promote and involve the imputations framed by the applicant which I have above recorded.
 After formally reading the affidavits of the applicant's solicitor sworn on 21 July 2005 and 20 September 2005, counsel for the applicant informed the Court that he did not seek to cross-examine Mr Grigor-Scott upon the material the subject of his foregoing lengthy written communications made to the Court as identified above, or otherwise.
 I further pointed out to him that he needed to confront the issue arising at the instance of the applicant and involving that material alleged by the applicant in its pleadings to have offended the legislation and which he appeared to have adopted as his own, and as that also of the BBC.
