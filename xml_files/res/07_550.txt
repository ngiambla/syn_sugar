 It admits that a document dated 27 July 2003 between the plaintiff and the owner was made in the terms alleged (the agreement), and that a document dated 24 August 2003 between the plaintiff and the owner was made in the terms of an agreement and mortgage (the agreement/mortgage) as alleged.
 It admits that the plaintiff advanced to the owner pursuant to the agreement the funds it alleges were advanced, and that the owner failed to repay the loan by 31 May 2004. 9 There is also no dispute that on 25 May 2005 the plaintiff served notice on the owner requiring repayment of all outstanding advances, and of its intention to enforce the mortgage, that the vessel was arrested by order of this Court in July 2005 and the vessel and its unused bunkers and lubricants sold by order of the Court in November 2005, and that the proceeds of sale are presently held in two designated accounts. 10 The defence pleads that no officer of the vessel or the owner was authorised to sign the agreement or the mortgage so as to bind the owner, so that neither agreement is binding on the vessel or the owner and so that there is no valid mortgage over the vessel.
 The owner denies that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief. 14 A consequence of the way that is pleaded is that the owner has not directly pleaded to the extent of the present outstanding advances (having regard to payments made by the owner and to interest calculations under the agreement and other monies received by the plaintiff in reduction of the level of advances.
 The relevant meetings occurred on 9 May, 10 May, 10 June, 26 June and 2 October 2004. 26 On 8 August 2004 the owner sent a fax to its insurer of the vessel asking that the plaintiff be recorded as the first beneficiary in case of any 'actual total loss claims'.
