 That submission was said to be further sufficient per se to dispose of the applicant's case. 36 I have already observed incidentally that by question 3 of Part A of that Form 1010, as completed by the applicant, she indicated her agreement to the Department communicating to her by both facsimile and email, the relevant contact details being of course detailed thereby.
 I have also already observed that the applicant's residential address in that Form 1010 so completed by her on 7 July 2004 was 'No. 3 Allenby Crescent Strathfield NSW 2135' (see again par 5 of Form 1010), that being the address of 'Myself' (see again par 71 of Form 1010) and said by the Minister to be at least to cover '[a]ll written communications about Business Skills monitoring ...'.
