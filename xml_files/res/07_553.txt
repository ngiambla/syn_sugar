 It was thus the case of the applicant that the service of that Form 1010 'plainly did not comply with the requirements of s 494D(1) ', and that therefore the Minister 'should not be permitted to rely upon information it obtained from the applicant in a manner not permitted by the statute to support the legality of actions subsequently taken by it against the applicant'.
 The Minister's response to the applicant's case as so ultimately framed above in summary 33 The Minister's response to the submissions of the applicant commenced with the observation that the applicant's authorisation in favour of Ms Tang, made of course on 15 October 2001 and headed '[a]uthorisation of person to act and receive communication' and numbered 956, was for Ms Tang '... to act on my behalf in relation to my application/sponsorship in dealings with the Department of Immigration...'.
 That submission was said to be further sufficient per se to dispose of the applicant's case. 36 I have already observed incidentally that by question 3 of Part A of that Form 1010, as completed by the applicant, she indicated her agreement to the Department communicating to her by both facsimile and email, the relevant contact details being of course detailed thereby.
 I have also already observed that the applicant's residential address in that Form 1010 so completed by her on 7 July 2004 was 'No. 3 Allenby Crescent Strathfield NSW 2135' (see again par 5 of Form 1010), that being the address of 'Myself' (see again par 71 of Form 1010) and said by the Minister to be at least to cover '[a]ll written communications about Business Skills monitoring ...'.
