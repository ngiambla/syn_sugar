 The court has the discretion to apportion costs even if it cannot identify separate costs in respect of distinct or severable issues or inquiries on which the successful litigant failed, but the matters on which the party failed must be at least capable of separation from the matters on which the litigant was successful.
 This was an issue which could be treated as clearly distinct and severable, it being in effect a positive contention raised by the NCC in its points of defence and amended points of defence, which had little merit and did add to the costs of preparation of the parties for trial.
 In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the economic test could be relevant to the contention that Hamersley was wrongly decided or could provide an appropriate replacement test. 46 Unlike the position of Fortescue, who was responding to the Hamersley decision, the NCC sought to introduce an economic test which could amount to nothing more than submission and argument.
 Whilst BHPBIO and Fortescue also sought to tender economic expert evidence, it was in response to the NCC's evidence, and I do not think this impacts upon the significance of the unnecessary introduction of the economic expert evidence by the NCC for the purposes of considering costs. 47 It is sometimes preferable after apportioning issues as I have done to avoid leaving the quantification and fixing of costs of those issues to taxation.
