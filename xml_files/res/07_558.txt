 However, it must be remembered that s 128B(3)(h)(ii) provides that s 128B does not apply to income that consists of: ...interest derived by a non-resident in carrying on business in Australia at or through a permanent establishment of the non-resident in Australia... 15 Then, in respect of withholding tax, s 128D, so far as is relevant, provides: Income...upon which withholding tax is payable...is not assessable income. 16 Without the intervention of s 128B(3)(h)(ii), the interest income of the Highland trust estate, to which GECIH was, in the relevant income years, presently entitled, could not be included in the assessable income of the trust estate and could not be taxed pursuant to s 98(3) of the Assessment Act.
 To that end, the provisions of this Bill will amend the present Australian domestic law so that a beneficiary or unit holder resident in a taxation agreement partner country who is entitled to a share of trust income derived from business operations carried on in Australia, will be deemed to be carrying on the business of the trustee through a permanent establishment situated in Australia.
 The income tax law is to be amended so that a beneficiary or unit holder who is resident in a treaty country, and who (whether via one or more other trusts or not) is entitled to a share of trust income derived from business operations carried on in Australia, shall be deemed to be carrying on the business of the trustee through a permanent establishment situated in Australia, where the trustee's business would constitute a permanent establishment having regard to the provisions of the relevant double taxation agreement.
 Section 3(11) is not directed to the operation of the withholding tax provisions and provisions that actually impose tax, and was introduced as an enabling provision only to assist in the taxing of distributions to a trust beneficiary which has a non-resident in the context of the business profits article where the concept of a permanent establishment is significant.
