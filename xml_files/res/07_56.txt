 Those same matters were also the subjects, allegedly, of terms of the contract. 3 It would appear from para 23 of the Statement of Claim that representatives acting on behalf of Flottweg dealt with the machine for some purposes (alleged by Olivaylle) to be by way of repair and modification.
 On the day of that response Flottweg's solicitors again indicated they had no indication that Olivaylle could meet a costs order and foreshadowed that if they had to make an application for security and were unsuccessful because Olivaylle had the capacity to meet a costs order they would seek indemnity costs of that application. 5 On 10 January solicitors for Olivaylle indicated that they would resist such an application should it be made.
 On 24 January 2007 solicitors for Flottweg indicated that unless Olivaylle provided security for costs in a sum satisfactory to Flottweg or else evidence that Olivaylle had the means to satisfy a costs order, it would apply for a court order that Olivaylle provide security in the sum of $300,000 and it annexed a draft notice of motion seeking that sum.
 The first of these annexed the correspondence to which I have already referred and land title searches which revealed that the applicant is not a registered proprietor of property in South Australia but is the registered proprietor of a Crown allotment in Wallowa in the State of Victoria.
