 Mr Maher, in an affidavit filed in support of his motion, stated that the certificate of taxation relating to the costs order made on 26 September 2001 and the order of 9 February 2005 could not stand because the costs orders, made by Finkelstein J on 26 September 2001 had been set aside by a Full Court.
 The order of the Deputy Registrar made on 9 February 2005 be set aside. " It is notable that his Honour did not interfere with the costs orders which he had made on 2 and 5 February 2004.
 As Jessup J found, Mr Maher's notice of motion of 8 July 2005 did not seek orders setting aside the costs orders made on 2 and 5 February 2004; nor was any such application made orally in the course of argument before Finkelstein J on 26 July 2005. 6 On 9 June 2006 a certificate of taxation was issued in relation to the costs orders made on 2 and 5 February 2004.
 It was explained that Mr Maher sought to contend that the Registrar did not have jurisdiction to issue a further certificate and order relating to the costs orders, made by Finkelstein J on 2 and 5 February 2004, unless and until the certificate issued on 4 November 2004 and the order made on 9 February 2005 were set aside.
