 On 14 December 2004 the first and second respondents moved for orders that pursuant to Federal Court Rules (FCR) O 20 r 2(b) and (c) the proceeding be stayed or, in the alternative, dismissed.
 The circumstances in which decision on the motion has been delayed have been set out in Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com.limited [2007] FCA 262 and in reasons published on 15 April 2005 - Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com Limited [2005] FCA 438.
 The first contention made by the first and second respondents in support of the motion for stay or dismissal was that the application was an abuse of process because it was unlawfully maintained and champertous, and so an abuse of process.
