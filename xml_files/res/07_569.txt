 When the matter was called for hearing yesterday Mr Carl Moller acknowledged that his father Mr Jack Moller was absent and said: '... unfortunately he does have a medical condition and I have a doctor's certificate explaining that condition and he wont [sic] be attending Court. ' 22 A medical certificate of Dr Kerry Callan of 10 April 2007 was handed up but did not become evidence before the Court.
 However, it was indicated by Mr Carl Moller that his father intended not to return to Court for the further hearing of the matter and also intended not to return to the witness box to conclude his evidence and allow the further cross-examination of himself by junior counsel for the applicants to proceed. 24 After being served with the Notice of Motion returnable for 10:15 am today and apparently hearing a report from Mr Carl Moller as to what transpired in Court yesterday, Mr Jack Moller attended Court this morning along with his son Mr Carl Moller.
 I am not sure in relation to the observation that one has to address the matter question-by-question, but am disposed to agree that, until one gets to the first question that should appropriately be disallowed or the subject of information to the witness that the question need not be answered, there is no power conferred on the Court by s 41 to simply order that a person be excused from giving further evidence in a case. 38 In relation to s 58(2) of the Federal Court Act, the submission of the applicants is that it is a section constituting an offence.
