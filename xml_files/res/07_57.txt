 Mr McMaster says he is informed by Mr Zohar and believes it to be true that: (a) the appointment by St George in respect of the St George Secured Property was made on 29 March 2006 pursuant to a charge registered with ASIC and a registered mortgage; (b) the appointment is limited to the St George Secured Property and is not over all of the assets of Silkchime; (c) St George has realised assets other than the St George Secured Property sufficient to repay the debt secured by the security in full; (d) St George has now instructed the receivers not to proceed with the sale of the St George Secured Property; (e) Mr Zohar is unaware of any allegation or any act, matter or thing that may give rise to a claim against the receivers in respect of the St George Secured Property; (f) the receivers have not yet retired. 14 Mr McMaster also stated that on 24 January 2006 ING appointed Messrs Zohar, Korda and Winterbottom as joint and several receivers and managers of Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Ltd in its own capacity and as trustee for the Warwick Entertainment Centre Unit Trust.
 It appears that Mr Hammond has informed the solicitors for the receivers that his firm and Ms Coulson will issue separate fee notes in respect of Silkchime. 18 The solicitors for the receivers referred to the separate retainer arrangements between Mony de Kerloy and Richstar, Healthcare, Mr Carey and (albeit unwritten) with other defendants.
 They contended that there is a presumption of several liability and the fact that a number of clients authorise a solicitor to act and say they will pay the solicitor does not mean that each has agreed to pay the whole of the costs and does not create a joint liability.
 The question of an authorisation by the receivers does not arise in relation to Healthcare as that company, having private receivers appointed under a security, is the subject of Asset Preservation Orders rather than Receiver Orders. 20 In their submissions to the Court the receivers repeated their position that Mony de Kerloy had entered into separate retainers with each of Mr Carey, Richstar and Healthcare, albeit there was no evidence of a separate written retainer agreement with Redchime.
