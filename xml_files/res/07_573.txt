 On 4 January 2004 Mr Findlay, accompanied by Mr Vajda, Mr Salfinger, a Director of the company, namely Mr Peter Strachan, and a geologist commissioned by the company, namely Vic Wall, visited Canada for the purpose of inspecting the Spectrum, Summit Lake extended claims and the Summit Lake Mine.
 He also informed Mr Findlay the mine was owned by Tenajon and was not for sale. 29 In late February 2004 a further meeting was held between Mr Findlay, Mr Vajda and Mr Salfinger at which Mr Findlay expressed his dissatisfaction with the delays.
 Accordingly the representation that the company held such interest was misleading and deceptive and was made in the course of trade and commerce by Carminco and TPM through its director and secretary, Mr Salfinger, in breach of s 52 of the Act.
 Security for Loan 71 In mid-December 2003 Mr Findlay told Mr Salfinger that any loan made to the company for the acquisition of the Summit Lake Mine option would require the company to provide security over all of its properties including the Summit Lake Mine, and proper loan documentation.
