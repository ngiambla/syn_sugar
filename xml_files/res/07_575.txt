 Whether the Tribunal erred in law in finding the applicant's claim for compensation of 10 October 1988 for an injury of extreme anxiety and for which Comcare accepted liability on 24 February 1989 gave rise to a liability for compensation under s 14 of the SRC Act? 4.
 It was further submitted that the determination of the Comcare Independent Review Officer, David Warwick, affirming the original decision of Ms Failla, was not a determination as to whether there was any liability under s 14 of the SRC Act for a new injury of delusional/paranoid disorder.
