 It is not disputed that during 1988, the applicant suffered an injury of extreme anxiety and that, on 24 February 1989, Comcare accepted liability of the applicant's psychological condition which was described as an 'adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and depression'.
 Whether the Tribunal erred in law in finding the applicant's claim for compensation of 10 October 1988 for an injury of extreme anxiety and for which Comcare accepted liability on 24 February 1989 gave rise to a liability for compensation under s 14 of the SRC Act? 4.
 It was further submitted that the determination of the Comcare Independent Review Officer, David Warwick, affirming the original decision of Ms Failla, was not a determination as to whether there was any liability under s 14 of the SRC Act for a new injury of delusional/paranoid disorder.
 There is a certain overlap between this ground and the first ground; both go to the question of whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider and determine whether the applicant's delusional/paranoid disorder was a compensable injury under s 14 of the SRC Act although the first ground was predicated on the premise, implied if not express, that a claim for such an injury had been made.
