 His Honour commented that the jurisdictional issue had been overlooked but that if the proceedings were remitted to the Local Court, the respondent intended to agitate the issue before that court. 19 In the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court it is clear that the question whether the Federal Magistrate should go behind the judgment of the Local Court was raised but not in the context of any challenge to the assignment.
 Discretion to make sequestration order or to dismiss the creditor's petition 22 Section 52 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provides for the proof of certain matters and states that the Court, 'if it is satisfied with the proof of those matters, may make a sequestration order against the estate of the debtor'.
 It is for the debtor to persuade the Court that the circumstances are such as to warrant an exercise of the Court's discretion in his or her favour. 23 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant raised the issue of whether the Local Court judgment was a final judgment and also whether the stay order made by the Local Court ought to preclude the creditor from pursuing its petition.
