 The language employed is thus apt to pick up both pre and post 27 March 2006 conduct although it is only alleged that any contravention of s 792 occurred after that date. 17 In my view the amended pleading is embarrassing.
 It seeks to do this by relying on the same allegations as are relied on in relation to its s 298K case save that the conduct is alleged to have been engaged in for the sole or dominant reason that the pilots enjoyed the benefit of two enterprise bargaining agreements.
 This is necessary because s 792(4) stipulates that s 792 will not be contravened by conduct that occurs after its commencement (on 27 March 2006) unless that conduct is engaged in for the sole or dominant reason that the employees had the benefit of a particular industrial instrument.
