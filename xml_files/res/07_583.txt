 The evidence is that Benson had and relied upon his own financial advisers in relation to the formation and their operation of Tiltform Australia and that he was experienced in the conduct of his own businesses.
 And that always remained your understanding from that time on, didn't it?---After having read what Sladojevic said and Bell said on the 26 th , what I was looking for was that funding had been confirmed .
 The second was the complex of misrepresentations contained in the 7 August 2000 letter. 239 I am satisfied that both Bell and Sladojevic had no reasonable grounds for making the representations that they did.
 To the extent that Bell and Sladojevic acted and were seen to act for Tiltform Licensing no possible foundation existed for characterising Bell and/or Sladojevic's relationship with the WA investors as fiduciary.
