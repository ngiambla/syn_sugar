 In that case Einstein J observed that the legislative intention was that s 236 and s 237 of the Act were only to apply where the application was made in respect of a company which was a going concern, and not in respect of a company which was in liquidation.
 At 295, at [73], Einstein J said: There are clear indications within s 237 to the effect that the section does not extend to and does not contemplate, circumstances in which the subject company on behalf of which an application for leave to bring proceedings or to intervene in proceedings is made, is a company in liquidation.
 Where a company is in liquidation the scheme of the Corporations Act is that it is the liquidator who is the appropriate party to determine whether proceedings should be brought on behalf of a company or whether any particular step should be taken on behalf of the company in relation to any proceedings.
