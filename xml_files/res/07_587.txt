 Further Mr Bove alleges that by reason of the alleged breaches the trust assets were depleted and, in some cases, found their way into the hands of Kiss Tell Australia Pty Ltd, a company controlled by the Charltons. 3 Mr Bove requested Mr McVeigh to bring an action against Mr and Mrs Charlton and their company for damages and to recover the allegedly misappropriated trust assets.
 Instead he made an application in the Supreme Court of Victoria for "directions pursuant to O 54 of the Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules 2005 as to the respective entitlements of the trustee and the defendants [Fumina Pty Ltd and Mr Bove] to the property of the trust. " That application has not yet been listed for hearing. 4 In these circumstances Mr Bove asks for leave to bring the action in the name of Golden River Footwear against the Charltons and their company.
 In summary he must show that it is probable the company will not itself bring the proceeding, that he is acting in good faith, that it is in the best interests of the company that he be granted leave, that there is a serious question to be tried and, finally, that Mr Bove has given the company notice of his intention to apply for leave to bring the action. 6 It is conceded that each requirement has been satisfied other than the requirement that the proceeding is in the best interests of the company.
