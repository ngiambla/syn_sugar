 The explanatory memorandum to the Bill that preceded that Act (the ' Reform Bill EM ') states that the principal object of the reforms implemented by the legislation was to 'improve the overall efficiency of migration litigation' by, inter alia, improvements to court processes to facilitate the 'quicker handling of cases'.
 On the contrary, the provisions of ss 477 , 477A and 486A indicate that Parliament intended applications for judicial review of migration decisions to be subject to the same time limits and the same restrictions on extensions of time whether brought in the FMC, the Federal Court or the High Court.
 Once the proceeding was transferred however, pursuant to O 82 r 3 of the Federal Court Rules , the proceeding was to be treated as if it had been instituted in this Court with the consequence that the application filed in the FMC is to be treated as an application made to this Court.
