 The preamble to those criteria was expressed as follows: '1068-F1 Subject to points 1068-F3 and 1068-F4, an amount to help cover the cost of rent is to be added to a person's maximum basic rate for a period if: ...' Claims for partner allowance 15 As at 15 December 1999 s 771IA et seq of the Social Security Act made provision for the making of claims for a partner allowance.
 Section 771IA(1) provided: '771IA(1) A person who wants to be granted a partner allowance must make a proper claim for that allowance. ' (the comparable provision of the Administration Act under which claims for a partner allowance may be made is now s 11(1)) Determination of claims for partner allowance 16 Under s 771JA the Secretary to the Department was required to 'determine the claim' (see now s 36(1) of the Administration Act).
 In the Tribunal's view this was clearly Mr Cameron requesting a review of the decision not to pay him rent assistance, and arrears must be backdated accordingly. ' The SSAT was in error in construing any attendance by the respondent at a Centrelink Office on 14 June 2005 with details of a money order for rent as an application for review of a 'decision not to pay him rent assistance'.
 However she accepted the respondent's evidence that he 'enquired' about his rent assistance entitlement previously ( Cameron v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] AATA 1039 at [22] ). 55 The Tribunal Member, in my view incorrectly, concluded that the decision, review of which was sought by the respondent under s 129 of the Administration Act, was the decision made on or about 15 December 1999 to pay partner allowance to the respondent from 15 December 1999. 56 Section 109(2) only applies to determine the day on which a 'favourable determination' takes effect where that favourable determination is made as a result of an application under s 129 of the Administration Act for review of a decision under, relevantly for present purposes, s 78 of the Administration Act.
