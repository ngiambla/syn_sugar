 Section 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act (1976) provides that the court or a judge may order an applicant in a proceeding in the court, or an appellant in an appeal to the court, to give security for the payment of costs that might be awarded against such a party.
 If the appeal raises an arguable question, or an arguable matter of statutory construction, although minds might legitimately differ on the strengths and weaknesses of the arguable question, it seems to me that the citizen should rarely be prevented from progressing his or her appeal by force of a security for costs order.
 The total amount of costs in connection with Mr Burgess's appeal are said to amount to $3,439, although some categories of costs may not have been included in the schedule. 28 I propose to make an order for security for costs which is a discounted amount from the proposed schedule.
