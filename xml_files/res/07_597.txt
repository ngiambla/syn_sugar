 It would follow that orders concerning the persons making up "the applicant" could not be made. 9 The question as to the nature of "the applicant" for the purposes of the NTA has been raised in other proceedings.
 In those circumstances I held that the presumptions usually applied to personal appointments could operate, which is to say that their authorisation is intended to continue until revoked and whilst they are willing and able to act in their representative capacity.
 For administrative convenience and clarity, their authorisation might also be ratified at the same meeting which authorises the new appointment or appointments, but this is not necessary. ' 12 I adhere to that view for the reasons given.
 I note that the decision in the Butchulla People's application has been followed by Spender J in Doolan v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 192. 13 The approach which I consider to be open does not limit the grounds for the effective removal of a person to those in s 66B(1), rather it gives effect to the basis upon which authorisation was originally made.
