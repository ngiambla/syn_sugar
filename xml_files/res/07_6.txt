 The alleged errors may be summarised as follows. (a) The Tribunal breached s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in failing to provide particulars of, and invite comment on, certain information that was relevant to the Tribunal's decision to refuse the appellant's application for a protection visa and which the appellant had not given for the purpose of his application to the Tribunal.
 Given the context of the Tribunal's comment concerning the production of original documents I am satisfied that the Tribunal was referring to documents in the more usual sense, such as the application form, the appellant's son's call-up notice, a newspaper clipping and so on and was not referring to photographs.
