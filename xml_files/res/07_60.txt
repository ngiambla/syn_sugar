 While denying any agreement with Mr Packer, the first to fourth respondents in this proceeding admit that an agreement was entered into by CAL to sell its shares to another company. 15 (xiii) On 3 and 26 July 1997 pleadings were filed in the inquiry as to damages proceeding by the plaintiff and defendants respectively. 16 (xiv) On 18 July 2000 a Master of the Supreme Court ordered the preliminary hearing of five issues from the apparently substantial numbers that had arisen between the parties.
 His application for an inquiry as to damages was dismissed. 18 (xvi) On 17 September 2004, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia dismissed Mr Cirillo's appeal against the judgment of Olsson AJ. 19 (xvii) On 3 March 2005, the first to fourth respondents applied to the Supreme Court for costs in respect of Mr Cirillo's application for an inquiry as to damages in the sum of $1.1 million. 20 (xviii) Special leave to appeal to the High Court from the Full Court's decision was refused on 17 June 2005. 21 (xix) On 28 July 2005, Olsson AJ made order by consent: "1.
 The Defendant, Vincenzo Giovanni Cirillo, pay to the Plaintiffs, Citicorp Australia Limited, CW Construction Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation), John Harold Heard and Stephen Elliott Young, the costs (including reserved costs) of and incidental to the Defendant's application dated 4 April 1997 relating to the enquiry as to damages on the Plaintiffs' undertaking as to damages in these proceedings, such costs being agreed and fixed in the sum of $500,000.00. " 22 (xx) On 19 June 2006 the first to fourth respondents issued a bankruptcy notice against Mr Cirillo claiming a debt of $500,000 pursuant to the costs order.
 In consequence, no issue of res judicata or of collateral attack on a final order arose in that case. 34 For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the application should be dismissed as against the first to the fourth respondents. 35 In relation to Finlaysons' motion, I am equally satisfied that to allow the application to remain on foot would in the circumstances be manifestly unfair to that firm and would itself constitute an abuse of process.
