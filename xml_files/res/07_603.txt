 That course was not available here, the Commonwealth being already an active party, but it was also unnecessary, since, as I have said, X was capably represented. ' 9 This issue was not considered when the High Court dealt with the matter on appeal in X v The Commonwealth [1999] HCA 63 ; (1999) 200 CLR 177.
 One can well understand how these proceedings, given their history, have got to the point that they have, where I must now determine whether or not orders in the nature of a writ of prohibition ought be issued prohibiting the members of the committees from further participating, so far as they still are members of the panel and are able to participate, in the deliberations on the administrative referral in each doctor's case. 14 The hearing before me was conducted as one in which there was an active and substantive argument put not merely as to statutory construction but to support the impartiality of decision-making processes of committees which were under attack for apparent bias.
 I am therefore of opinion that it is appropriate, albeit extremely unfortunate, to make an order in each matter in the nature of a writ of prohibition which will have the effect that none of the current members of each committee who are capable of being constituted on a further committee be members of any such reconstituted committee.
