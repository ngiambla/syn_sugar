 Thus the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth appealed to the Privy Council in the Boilermakers' case ..., though he was only an intervener in the High Court..." 6 These authorities support and reflect the general rule that once a person has been granted leave to intervene, that person is treated as a party with all the rights of a party.
 This suggests that rights of intervention granted at trial are rights that exist peculiarly for the trial and were not intended to survive to the appeal, and certainly not in any expanded form. 11 If it were otherwise a person who had been granted leave to intervene in the proceedings on terms relevant to those proceedings and on a quite limited basis, as indeed happened here, would upon the institution of an appeal have its rights as an intervenor on terms in the proceedings at trial extended to the appeal and thereupon converted into full party rights.
 Given that the purpose of the intervention rules is to confine and limit intervention, it would do considerable violence to that intention if, on an appeal, the rights of such a person became extended and enlarged in this way. 12 Accordingly, it is my view that the expression "party" under the regime introduced by the new intervention rules, does not extend to entities granted leave to intervene on terms.
