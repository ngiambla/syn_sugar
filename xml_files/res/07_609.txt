 THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner or had ever practiced Falun Gong in China or had any intention of doing so should she return there.
 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant attended Falun Gong practice sessions in Australia and found that whilst the appellant may have observed others in Sydney, her inability to describe basic principles suggested that she did not participate in the sessions.
 REASONS Grounds 1 and 2 The Tribunal concluded that although it was accepted that the appellant may have observed other people practising Falun Gong in both China and Australia, the appellant herself was not a Falun Gong practitioner.
