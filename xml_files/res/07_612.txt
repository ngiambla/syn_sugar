 The Tribunal found the appellant was not credible and therefore was not satisfied the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner in China or Australia or engaged in any 'anti-party' activities. 10 The Tribunal concluded that the appellant was not a credible witness and that he was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China, nor had he practised Falun Gong or engaged in any Falun Gong activities in Australia, and did not engage in any other "anti-party" activities in China or Australia.
 In relation to a claim that particulars under s 424A of the Act should have been provided in the Tribunal's hearing letter when it was complying with s 425 of the Act , his Honour stated (at [27]) that: The Applicant claims that the Tribunal should have included particulars of the information and explanation in its letter, and that a failure to do so is a jurisdictional error.
