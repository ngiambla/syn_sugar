 NuSep issued a prospectus for the issue of the shares and options on 14 December 2006 in which it stated that it would apply within seven days thereafter for such quotation. 2 Due to a misunderstanding referred to below, the application for the admission of the securities to quotation was not made within the seven-day period.
 There followed communications between Mr Patel and the ASX officer assigned to the matter. 9 The nub of the present problem is that, according to the evidence, Mr Mark Smith, the partner at Duncan Cotterill handling the matter, and Mr Patel believed that by applying for the indicative ruling, NuSep had applied for quotation of the shares and options on the ASX.
 If the application for quotation had been made by 21 December 2006, I have little doubt that the securities would have been admitted to quotation within three months after the date of the prospectus, that is to say, by 14 March 2007. 32 The best estimate that can be given by Nusep is that the securities will be admitted to quotation within approximately the next four weeks.
