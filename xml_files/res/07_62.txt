 On 18 August 2003, the Appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. 9 On 5 December 2003, the Tribunal wrote to the Appellant and advised him that it had considered all the material before it relating to the Appellant's application but was unable to make a decision in favour of the Appellant on that information alone.
 Accordingly, the Tribunal was entitled to conduct a dispositive assessment of the evidence available to it in order to determine whether it could be satisfied that the Appellant was a person at risk of persecution in India due to his sexual orientation and thus determine whether the Appellant, objectively assessed, held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason namely, membership of a social group described as 'homosexuals in India'.
 No obligation arose in the Tribunal to seek further information from the Appellant. 16 Moreover, no obligation arose in the Tribunal to seek further information from the Appellant or any other person once the Tribunal determined that it could not be satisfied of the relevant matters on the evidence then before it.
