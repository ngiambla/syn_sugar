 The Minister submits that whilst those Regulations had the effect of continuing the applicant's permanent residency status, pursuant to s 34 of the Act the applicant was also deemed to have been granted an absorbed person visa.
 That expectation weighed in favour of cancelling his visa, and the Minister said she gave moderate weight to that consideration. 20 Finally, the Minister had regard to primary consideration (c), the best interests of the applicant' s 14 year old son.
 In reaching my decision I concluded that the seriousness of Mr MOORE's conviction for Manslaughter and his criminal history, and, to a lesser extent, the expectations of the Australian community outweighed all other considerations. 33.
 The Applicant was at the time of the decision of the Respondent not the holder of an absorbed person's visa; rather he was the holder only of a transitional (permanent) visa which was not cancelled by the decision of the Respondent nor taken to be cancelled by operation of sub-s. 501F(3). 2.
