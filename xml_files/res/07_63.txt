 In these circumstances, while the Tribunal has clearly made a factual error in referring to Indonesia and the PRC in its reasons for decision, I consider that such factual error is not such as to amount to a jurisdictional error, that the Tribunal has understood the applicant's claims and assessed those claims despite the unfortunate reference to the wrong country on two occasions .
 To the extent that the Tribunal was influenced by any impression or belief that this Appellant was an Indonesian national or any well-founded fear of persecution bore any relation to anything that authorities in the People's Republic of China might do, such considerations may constitute errors which reflect a failure to afford fairness to the Appellant in the exercise of the review jurisdiction and thus jurisdictional errors.
