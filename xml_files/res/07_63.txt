 The Tribunal is unable to be satisfied, on the evidence before it, that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason'. [emphasis added] 16 It can be seen therefore that although the Tribunal has correctly described in parts of the Decision Record the Appellant as a national of Pakistan and has addressed the facts and circumstances of the claim of a well-founded fear of persecution contained in the material before the Tribunal reciting the events identified at [6], the Tribunal has described the Appellant as an Indonesian national in the section described as 'Findings and Reasons' and in reaching the ultimate conclusion, the Tribunal has concluded that the Appellant faces a real chance of persecution should he return to the People's Republic of China now or in the foreseeable future.
 In these circumstances, while the Tribunal has clearly made a factual error in referring to Indonesia and the PRC in its reasons for decision, I consider that such factual error is not such as to amount to a jurisdictional error, that the Tribunal has understood the applicant's claims and assessed those claims despite the unfortunate reference to the wrong country on two occasions .
 To the extent that the Tribunal was influenced by any impression or belief that this Appellant was an Indonesian national or any well-founded fear of persecution bore any relation to anything that authorities in the People's Republic of China might do, such considerations may constitute errors which reflect a failure to afford fairness to the Appellant in the exercise of the review jurisdiction and thus jurisdictional errors.
 Notwithstanding that the Tribunal has in its decision record reflected an analysis of the claims made by the Appellant, the erroneous references to Indonesian nationality and the notion of a well-founded fear of persecution should the Appellant return to the Peoples Republic of China can only lead to the conclusion that the errors have affected the exercise of the power.
