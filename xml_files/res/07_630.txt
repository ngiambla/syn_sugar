 He returned to Australia on 2 June 1997 on a Sri Lankan (Temporary) (Class TT) visa (subclass 435) (subclass 435 visa), which had been issued in Melbourne and which expired on 31 July 1997. 4 On 31 July 1997 the appellant applied for a further subclass 435 visa, which was refused on 12 August 1997.
 The appellant responded with submissions which were received by the Tribunal on 17 July 2006. 12 On 19 July 2006 the Tribunal again wrote to the appellant inviting him pursuant to s 359(2) of the Act to comment on information which indicated that he did not enter Australia on 1 November 1993 as the holder of an entry permit or an entry visa which had effect as if it were an entry permit.
 The appellant did not respond to the invitation and, accordingly, on 28 August 2006 the Tribunal affirmed the primary decision. 13 In summary, the Tribunal found that: (a) in order to succeed in the visa application, the appellant must meet all the criteria for the grant of the visa; (b) the appellant applied for a subclass 435 visa.
