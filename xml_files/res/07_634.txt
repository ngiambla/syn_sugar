 Of particular relevance to this case, Pt IIA allows for the making of an emergency declaration of preservation where there are reasonable grounds to believe that an Aboriginal place or an Aboriginal object is under threat of injury or desecration: s 21C. 9 An emergency declaration may be made by an inspector, the Minister or a magistrate in particular circumstances: s 21C(1).
 The applicant contended that the respondent did not comply with the requirements of s 21R of the Act, as affected by s 33(4) of the Acts Interpretation Act . 14 One contention was based on the premise that it was implicit in s 21R of the Act that before the respondent may appoint an inspector under s 21R, he must obtain the recommendation, approval or consent of the local Aboriginal community.
 Section 21R enables the respondent to appoint inspectors after consultation with a local Aboriginal community. 16 In my view, the power of the respondent to appoint an inspector under s 21R is not contingent upon the recommendation, or subject to the approval or consent, of a local Aboriginal community, as the concept of consultation is not the same as acting upon a recommendation, approval or consent.
