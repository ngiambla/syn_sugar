 A successful plaintiff is entitled to interest on a judgment debt for the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which judgment is entered unless good cause is shown to the contrary: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 51A.
 This is well above a commercial rate of interest and so will not be applied here. 6 The unsuccessful respondents, while not contending that TSB Retail should not have any interest, say that the period for which interest should run ought be less than the period mentioned in s 51A.
 The reason they say the period should be reduced is that TSB Retail failed to bring the action on for trial with due diligence. 7 One policy behind the award of interest is to reimburse the plaintiff for having been kept out of his money by a defendant who has had the use of it himself in the meantime.
 But, as the cases show, delay can be relevant and certainly would have been relevant were a penalty rather than "commercial" rate of interest applied: Clarke v Foodland Stores Pty Ltd [1993] 2 VR 382. 8 In my reasons for judgment I explained that the damages awarded to TSB Retail flowed from breaches of copyright committed between March 2003 and February 2004.
