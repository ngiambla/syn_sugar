 On 13 November 2006, the Federal Magistrate heard an application for summary judgment against the applicants on the grounds that the applicants' application was not filed within the timeframe provided for by s 477 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).
 The Associate advised that the Court would continue to convene at the appointed time on 1 May 2007 and would telephone the first applicant at that time on the same mobile telephone number. 12 On the convening of the Court on 1 May 2007 a telephone connection was attempted with the first applicant's nominated mobile telephone number.
 No explanation is before the Court as to why that date appears when the relevant Court officer states it was duly received on 30 April 2007; (b) the terms of the certificate state only that the first applicant's disability of severe lower back pain makes him unfit to attend court between certain dates.
