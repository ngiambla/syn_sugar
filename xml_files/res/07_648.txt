 The information was that there was a substantial difference between the claims he made in his original application for a protection visa and those made to the Tribunal, and that it was not plausible that his agent would omit the most crucial elements of his claims.
 Since such processes do not amount to "information" for the purposes of s 424A , the duty of disclosure is not enlivened. 34 The first respondent accepts that the material in the protection visa application was "information" for the purposes of s 424A.
 The appellant in NBKT provided written submissions to the Tribunal in support of her application for review (which consisted in a letter from her advisers and a statement by herself), expanding upon the claims stated in her protection visa application and introducing further claims.
 In NBKT Young J (with whom Gyles and Stone JJ concurred) held that by filing written submissions with the Tribunal that expressly referred to and incorporated the statement of grounds which were attached to her visa application, the appellant invited the Tribunal to refer to her protection visa application.
