 The assessment provided that the applicant's taxable income was $1.73 million for that year, and the tax payable was $842,062, due and payable on 5 June 2006 pursuant to s 204 of the ITA Act. 8 On 25 August 2006, an officer of the respondent left the notice of assessment at the applicant's post office box along with an information letter and reasons for decision.
 If it appears, either on the face of a notice of assessment or from elsewhere that the Commissioner has not attempted in good faith to determine the taxable income or has not made an assessment definitive of the tax liability of the taxpayer, the assessment does not attract the protection of s 175.
 There is no indication that the tax liability stated is tentative or provisional: see Richard Walter at 237 per McHugh J. 31 The variety of matters upon which the applicant sought to rely go no further than establishing that the respondent might have taken an alternative view as to the assessment.
