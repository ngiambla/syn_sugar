 In particular, the first appellant claimed that the Tribunal had not complied with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") by failing to provide her with written notice that a reason for its adverse decision would be her claim that the kidnapping investigation was neglected as a result of her political affiliations.
 The Tribunal in this case is simply noting a failure to reiterate a claim, and that in my view cannot constitute information of a kind which would attract the application of s 424A of the Migration Act .
