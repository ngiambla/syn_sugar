 In particular, the first appellant claimed that the Tribunal had not complied with s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") by failing to provide her with written notice that a reason for its adverse decision would be her claim that the kidnapping investigation was neglected as a result of her political affiliations.
 The Tribunal in this case is simply noting a failure to reiterate a claim, and that in my view cannot constitute information of a kind which would attract the application of s 424A of the Migration Act .
 The critical and operative finding was, however, that "there was no attempt to kidnap the [appellant's] son. " Once the Tribunal had reached this point in its reasoning nothing which it might have said as to the reason for the kidnapping or the reason for any alleged interference with a police investigation into it could, in my opinion, form an operative reason for rejecting the appellant's claim. 15 Moreover, there is force in the Minister's contention that the claim about political interference had formed part of the claims made in support of the appellant's visa applications and that these claims had been republished to the Tribunal when review of the delegate's decision was sought.
 The Tribunal remains of the view that the space for the date in the top part of the document is there to indicate the date on which the report to the police was made, the time, page number and paragraph number of the police book in which it is found.
