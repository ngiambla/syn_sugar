 The defendant did not quarrel with those principles as being relevant to the assessment of penalty in the present proceeding. 3 However, the defendant points to a failure to comply with the Rules of the Federal Court concerning enforcement of orders of the Court by committal.
 That is to say, it was by way of further endeavour to assuage the affront to the Court for his failure to comply with the Court's order of 16 September 2005. 21 I consider that, in assessing penalty, there should be a single penalty fixed in relation to the whole of the defendant's conduct.
