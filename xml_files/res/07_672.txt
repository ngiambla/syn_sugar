 The defendant did not quarrel with those principles as being relevant to the assessment of penalty in the present proceeding. 3 However, the defendant points to a failure to comply with the Rules of the Federal Court concerning enforcement of orders of the Court by committal.
 That is to say, it was by way of further endeavour to assuage the affront to the Court for his failure to comply with the Court's order of 16 September 2005. 21 I consider that, in assessing penalty, there should be a single penalty fixed in relation to the whole of the defendant's conduct.
 While it has taken several attempts and the Commission is still not entirely satisfied with the defendant's responses, he has to the extent, limited though it may be, that he has cooperated in attending further examinations, demonstrated some contrition. 22 Certainly, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the first charge.
