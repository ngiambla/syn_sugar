 The second respondents have been in partnership since 12 October 2004 and carrying on business under the partnership name 'Warehouse Matrix'. 14 The applicant pleads that it was possessed of confidential information relating to its clients which, because of the nature of the first respondent's employment with the applicant, was disclosed to the first respondent so that the first respondent might fulfil his responsibilities as a sales account manager with the applicant.
 No particulars are given of how or when the male second respondents acquired that knowledge. 22 The plea in par 25 is that the male second respondents had actual knowledge that the first respondent had acquired confidential information possessed by the applicant. 23 The plea in par 26 is that the male second respondents 'at all material times' had actual knowledge that the first respondent was disclosing or using that confidential information in providing the written quotes. 24 Alternatively, it is pleaded that the male second respondents after 14 March 2005 knew that the first respondent was disclosing or using the applicant's confidential information in the written quotes: par 27 of the PFASC.
 The knowledge may be imputed the plea asserts because of the second respondents' failure to make any inquiries or take proper steps to ensure that the first respondent was not disclosing or using the applicant's confidential information. 29 It is pleaded by reason of the matters in pars 23, 24, 25 and 26 or 28 of the PFASC that the second respondents knowingly participated in each of the first respondent's breaches of his duty of trust and confidence. 30 As a particular to this plea it is asserted that the acts, conduct and knowledge of each of the second respondents is imputed to them all.
