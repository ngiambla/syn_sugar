 The Magistrate found that, in essence, the appellant's claims in his statement (which was not before the Tribunal) were fairly reproduced in the record of decision (which was before the Tribunal).
 The Tribunal said: "The applicant did not appear before the Tribunal on the day and at the time and place at which he was scheduled to appear and did not respond to any correspondence correctly addressed to him.
 The appellant did not take up that opportunity, and the power to proceed to make a decision on the review on the basis that the appellant did not appear at a proposed hearing on 20 May 2005 remained available to the Tribunal.
