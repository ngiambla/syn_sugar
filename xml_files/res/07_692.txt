 ASIC contends that the late or informal proxies should not be included, so that the final result was that there were votes cast in respect of 83 per cent of available votes. 13 The plaintiffs contend that the informalities do not detract from all of the votes showing a uniform assent in favour of the proposed orders.
 Whatever might have been the previous position, the meeting involved a process of detailed explanation, disclosure and frankness by the plaintiffs. 23 ASIC acknowledges the proposed role of the Supervisor and his access to the records of the business.
