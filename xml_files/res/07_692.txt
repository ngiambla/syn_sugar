 Whatever might have been the previous position, the meeting involved a process of detailed explanation, disclosure and frankness by the plaintiffs. 23 ASIC acknowledges the proposed role of the Supervisor and his access to the records of the business. (h) The complexity caused by having to terminate the scheme completion for whatever reason 24 ASIC submits that the further involvement of the scheme promoters complicates the position should a usual liquidation be required.
 I agree with the plaintiffs that the fundamental question is whether in all the circumstances including the provision of the protection orders, there are sufficient protections to investors so as to enable the orders to be made. (j) The seriousness of the identified contraventions 29 ASIC submits there is more than a minor insignificant breach of the managed investment scheme provisions of the Act.
