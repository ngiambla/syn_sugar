 1 The applicant, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ('ACCC') seeks orders pursuant to s 601AH(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (' Corporations Act ') that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('the Commission') reinstate the registration of Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (ACN 075 400 529) ('Dataline') and certain consequential orders.
 The ACCC's solicitors have received no response to that facsimile. 11 On 27 April 2007, the ACCC filed its application for the reinstatement order supported by the affidavit of David Brian Starkoff filed 23 April 2007 which deposes to the matters recited in the above chronology.
 Section 601AH(2) of the Corporations Act empowers the court to reinstate the registration of a deregistered company on the application of 'a person aggrieved' by the deregistration and in circumstances where the court is satisfied that 'it is just to do so'.
 Having regard to the 'important responsibility' of the ACCC in the enforcement of Part IV to be exercised in the public interest and the severity of the penalties imposed by Parliament in respect of contraventions of Part IV , Austin J was satisfied that the deregistered entity ought to be joined in the proceeding and thus exercised the power under s 601AH(2). 14 In this application, the ACCC does not seek reinstatement in order to commence litigation or join Dataline as a party.
