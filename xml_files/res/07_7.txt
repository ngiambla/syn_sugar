 Section 53(4)(c) of the 1971 Act expressly provides for 'ignorance' as a basis for exempting an application from the time requirement for making a claim however the provision was not made retrospective and thus does not apply to a claim made under the 1930 Act.
 The only direct evidence before the Tribunal was the statutory declaration made by the applicant and referred to above at [11], which unequivocally stated that his failure to make a claim within the requisite period was occasioned by ignorance as to his entitlements.
 The Tribunal referred to this evidence in its decision and concluded: "The only evidence before me is that of the Applicant to the effect that he did not claim because he was ignorant of his right to do so. " This finding of fact was open to the Tribunal and it is not for this Court to interfere with that conclusion. 29 Secondly, the Tribunal expressly rejected the applicant's counsel's submission that the applicant had no actual entitlement to compensation during the six month period following his 1971 injury.
