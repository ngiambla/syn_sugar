 He also deposed to promoting the idea of a Mythbusters television series with David Cowperthwaite (the Group Marketing and Sales Director of Channel 9 Australia) and Teresa Plummer-Andrews (Head of Children's Acquisition and Development at the BBC) at an international conference in 1994.
 This would be consistent with the fact that material was sent to XYZ Entertainment, the terms of the letter to Mr Harley, and the evidence of his statements in the meeting attended by Mr Knight, Mr Adolph and Mr Williams in late 1998.
 He had meetings with representatives of the ABC (between 12 September 2001 and 1 October 2004), Channel 9 (between 22 November 2001 and 1 October 2003), Channel 10 (between 21 October 2002 and 11 March 2004) and Channel 7 (between 15 February 2002 and 16 March 2004).
 Even from those witnesses who knew Mr Knight, were familiar with his books or knew of his plans for his own TV show, there was no evidence that those who actually watched the Mythbusters TV show believed, after watching it, that it reflected his concepts or was associated with him. 181 In my view Mr Knight has been unable to establish any misrepresentation by the respondents to ordinary members of the television viewing public.
