 The Tribunal was of the view that the appellant left China voluntarily, noting that the appellant's family were keen for her to undertake employment overseas. 5 The Tribunal found the appellant's account of her religious observance in Australia deeply confused.
 The Tribunal was not satisfied the appellant had sought religion in Australia "in the way that would be appropriate to someone who is afraid to worship in her country and who fled that country in order to find religious freedom".
