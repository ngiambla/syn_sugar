 The Tribunal took this into account in determining the appellant's net assets in the business, in the sense that the debt owed by the business to the appellant was added to the value of the net assets of the business itself.
 Based on the evidence as to the net assets of Quincy and taking into account the $61,000 debt owed by Quincy to the appellant, the Tribunal made preliminary calculations of the value of the appellant's net assets in Quincy, indicating at relevant times net assets over $100,000. 8 It was the financial records given by the appellant to the Tribunal through her representative that provided the framework and evidence for the Tribunal's findings as to the assets of Quincy.
 The second ground asserts that an error was made by the Tribunal when it applied the criterion in cl 845.215, which was addressed by the Federal Magistrates Court. 15 I adopt the reasons of his Honour in relation to the second ground of appeal.
 The Tribunal was not at large and had to apply the law as provided in the Regulations. 16 When the Act says that the Tribunal is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence, and shall act in accordance with the substantial justice and merits of the case (see s 353(2)), it does not mean the Tribunal can ignore the application of cl 845.215.
