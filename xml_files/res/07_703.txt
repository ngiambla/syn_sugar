 The Tribunal took this into account in determining the appellant's net assets in the business, in the sense that the debt owed by the business to the appellant was added to the value of the net assets of the business itself.
 The Tribunal was not at large and had to apply the law as provided in the Regulations. 16 When the Act says that the Tribunal is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence, and shall act in accordance with the substantial justice and merits of the case (see s 353(2)), it does not mean the Tribunal can ignore the application of cl 845.215.
