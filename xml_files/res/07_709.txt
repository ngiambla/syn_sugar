 A relevant usage right of data and documentation was accordingly created in favour of Westpoint Corporation, the legal nature of which is founded firstly on the relationship of agency, as detailed below, secondly on the relationship of lienor and lienee of documents for use in performance of functions attaching to that agency relationship, and thirdly as principal in the undertaking of the businesses described below.
 Their affairs being so extensively intermingled it is impossible to assess which transactions were those of Westpoint Corporation and which of another entity without access to the books and records. 13 ASIC has accepted the factual contentions relating to the Westpoint Group advanced on behalf of the liquidators.
 On 8 March 2007 it sent a further letter to them informing them that it intended to provide the Westpoint documents to the liquidators unless they sought a court order to restrain it from doing so by 16 March 2007. 18 Hotchkin Hanley did not respond to ASIC's letter of 8 March 2007.
 ASIC describes the orders it seeks as effectively permitting the liquidators to have access to their books but subject to the Court's supervision and control. 31 Absent a specific controversy about the proposed release or some proposed exercise by the liquidator of its powers, it is not appropriate for the Court to be providing judicial cover in advance for a decision which is properly the function of ASIC.
