 1 Under s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) the applicant Ms Stanislawa Bahonko seeks leave to appeal to a Full Court against a decision of Middleton J given on 20 December 2006: Bahonko v Nurses Board of Victoria [2006] FCA 1817.
 In the substantive proceeding the applicant seeks relief under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) for alleged racial discrimination. 2 At that stage his Honour had already reserved judgment on a question relating to the continuation of legal representation engaged by the first respondent.
 However, in granting the stay his Honour decided in effect that those questions should await the hearing and determination of the matter before VCAT: see [15]-[16]. 3 I do not detect any error in the exercise of his Honour's discretion to grant the stay.
 She seeks orders that the proceeding VID 855 of 2006 be reinstated, that Middleton J stand down from hearing the matter further, that Russell Kennedy Lawyers "are removed from acting in the matter", that motions issued by Russell Kennedy with respect to VID 855 of 2006 "cannot affect future proceedings and must be put aside" and that the jurisdiction of the Court in the matter VID 855 of 2006 be "extended by adding relevant and criminal jurisdiction". 7 As I have already mentioned, the stay order is valid and operative, and that means that the notice of motion, being a further step in the proceeding, cannot be brought.
