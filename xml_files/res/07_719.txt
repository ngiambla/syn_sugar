 He also claimed being targeted by "agents of the United States government" including the CIA. 3 On 13 October 2004, the tribunal wrote and advised the appellant that the member reviewing his case had ceased to be a member of the tribunal and that his application would be considered by a reconstituted tribunal.
 This followed its rejection of the main plank of the appellant's claim namely that he had been sought out and targeted for harm by the mafia and the CIA. 6 The tribunal emphasised its concern about the appellant's mental health and credibility.
 In its reasons it stated: "It is clear that the first Tribunal had concerns about the credibility and plausibility of the Applicant's claims, about the Applicant's state of mental health, and in any case, with whether his claims brought him within the Convention. ...
 However, nothing was submitted, and even if some sort of assessment of the Applicant's mental health was submitted, the Tribunal is still left squarely with the claims put forward by the Applicant or that arise squarely from his evidence. " It is clear that the tribunal was of the opinion that the appellant's mental state explained the nature of his allegations which were, in the tribunal's view, extremely unlikely. 7 The appellant sought judicial review of the tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.
