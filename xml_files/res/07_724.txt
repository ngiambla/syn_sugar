 According to the prospectus the application for the Official Quotation of new shares being offered pursuant to the prospectus would be made to the ASX within seven days after the date of the prospectus. 8 In the event, Mr Ho was a day late in lodging the application for Official Quotation.
 He had previously prepared an application for quotation of shares issued under a prospectus in circumstances where a company had asked for its securities to be readmitted to quotation on the ASX after a change of activities and a period of ASX suspension.
 He says that had he known of the consequences of non-compliance he would have ensured that he had obtained the approval of the directors necessary for a quotation application to be lodged at the ASX prior to the close of business on Tuesday, 10 April 2007. 9 Mr Ho began preparation of the quotation application on 5 April 2007 together with supporting information in the form of annexures.
 He informed Mr Ho that the ASX Rules required a quotation application to be lodged within seven days of the date of the prospectus. 13 On 4 April 2007 Mr Ho had received a letter bearing that date from ASIC to the company extending the exposure period for the prospectus from seven to nine days because of the Easter holiday.
