 The applicant's principal market would appear to be in its home territory of the United States. 19 Nor does it appear that the applicant is likely to be incapable of continuing with the proceedings if an order for security is made.
 It has been able to instruct solicitors in Australia to conduct the proceedings on its behalf and presumably to meet their costs. 20 In all the circumstances I propose to order that the applicant provide security for the costs of the proceedings in the amount of $80,000.
