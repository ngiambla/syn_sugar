 By their conduct in selling the GVSA and adapted versions of the CVSA Documents by means of internet websites and advertising in printed publications, the second and sixth respondents are said to have made representations that they were associated with, or had the sponsorship or approval of the applicant, that the GVSA was manufactured with the licence or other approval of the applicant and that the second and sixth respondents' businesses were the business of the applicant.
 The estimate does not appear inherently improbable and I accept it as a reasonable estimate of costs, albeit it does not appear to be limited to future costs. 12 According to the evidence of Mr Mallon, the solicitor for the respondents, he wrote to the applicant's solicitors on 14 March 2007 raising the respondents' concern that the applicant did not have any known assets within the jurisdiction.
 The applicant's principal market would appear to be in its home territory of the United States. 19 Nor does it appear that the applicant is likely to be incapable of continuing with the proceedings if an order for security is made.
 It has been able to instruct solicitors in Australia to conduct the proceedings on its behalf and presumably to meet their costs. 20 In all the circumstances I propose to order that the applicant provide security for the costs of the proceedings in the amount of $80,000.
