 Each of these grounds can only succeed, as counsel for the appellant properly conceded, if the Magistrate erred in finding that the representations had not been made. 8 The respondent has filed a notice of contention.
 The respondent further contends that there was no evidence to support the Magistrate's finding that, had the representations been made, the appellant would have suffered loss, calculated by reference to what he would have earned had he commenced employment with an alternative employer on 1 January 2003 rather than 15 April 2003.
 The project representations 11 The project representations, identified in the appellant's statement of claim, contained three parts. 12 The appellant complains that the Federal Magistrate only made findings in relation to the alleged representation that the respondent would provide the human tissue needed by the project.
 The Magistrate thereby dealt with that part of the project representations relating to the equipment. 24 The Federal Magistrate dealt with the project representations, insofar as they related to the appellant's contention that Professor Angus had promised to procure the human tissue samples, in his reasons at paras [69] --- [72] (set out above at [5]).
