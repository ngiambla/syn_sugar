 The applicant did not press her written submission that the respondent was not entitled to rely on information appearing in the ASC's database but rather was required to have resort to the original returns for the purpose of ascertaining the applicant's address.
 The respondent was entitled to rely on what appeared in the database to be the residential address of the applicant in circumstances where the information was supplied by the company pursuant to a statutory obligation.
 The Commissioner was also entitled to assume that the address was current given the failure by the company to advise of any change. "Woolaston Road, Warrnambool Vic 3280" reasonably appeared to the respondent to be an address to which notices could be sent to the applicant.
 When read with s 28A of the Acts Interpretation Act , it provides for various methods by which the notices contemplated by s 222AOE may be served on directors who the Commissioner of Taxation considers are liable to pay penalties when a company fails to meet its statutory obligations.
