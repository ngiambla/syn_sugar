 The fact that the Maoists were able to bomb the District Headquarters at Beni is strong evidence that if the Maoists want to carry out an attack they will do so and no amount of security will stop them.
 The Tribunal finds that the Applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of his actual or imputed political opinion. 14 In the Federal Magistrates Court, Lloyd-Jones FM concluded: I am satisfied that the Tribunal's findings were open to it for the reasons it gave and do not disclose any legal or procedural error. 15 The submissions on behalf of the appellant in respect of the first ground were that the Tribunal did not address or make findings on the appellant's claim that the Maoist, whom he criticised at a hotel was killed by security forces, or that the appellant's house and family was attacked by Maoists on 25 August 2002.
