 The Tribunal found that the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 1954 ('the Convention') and accordingly was not a person to whom Australia owe protection obligations. 6 By letter dated 27 March 2006 Mr Michael Jones, the appellant's solicitor, wrote to the Tribunal acknowledging receipt of the first decision and expressing surprise to see reference to the letter of 24 November 2005.
 The Minister also relies upon Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [26] - [27] and submits that the duty of the Tribunal to review the delegate's decision under s 414 (1) of the Act continues until one of the outcomes described in s 415(2) of the Act is reached.
 FINDINGS 15 Three issues are raised in this appeal namely whether the appellant should be granted leave to rely upon apprehension of bias which was expressly abandoned in the Federal Magistrates Court; whether the ground of appeal is in fact meritorious; and whether the appellant has waived any right to rely on such ground.
 Should leave be granted to the appellant to rely on the abandoned ground of appeal? 16 Only where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so will leave be granted to argue a ground of appeal abandoned in a lower court: see O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at [319] ; Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at [7] .
