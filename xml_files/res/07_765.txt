 The Minister also relies upon Applicant NAFF of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 62 ; (2004) 221 CLR 1 at [26] - [27] and submits that the duty of the Tribunal to review the delegate's decision under s 414 (1) of the Act continues until one of the outcomes described in s 415(2) of the Act is reached.
 FINDINGS 15 Three issues are raised in this appeal namely whether the appellant should be granted leave to rely upon apprehension of bias which was expressly abandoned in the Federal Magistrates Court; whether the ground of appeal is in fact meritorious; and whether the appellant has waived any right to rely on such ground.
