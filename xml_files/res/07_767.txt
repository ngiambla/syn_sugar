 Save for the provision of a letter addressed to the Registrar of the Court, faxed on 17 May 2007 together with a medical certificate dated 16 May 2007, there has been no communication from the appellant.
 In particular, in breach of directions given on 19 March 2007, no written submissions have been filed on behalf of the appellant. 5 When the matter was called on for hearing this morning, there was no appearance by the appellant.
 The explanation may lie in the medical certificate which says simply that the appellant attended a medical practitioner on 16 May 2007 and was considered to be "unfit for work" on 17 and 18 May 2007.
