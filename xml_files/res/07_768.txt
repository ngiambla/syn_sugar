 In that judgment, her Honour dismissed an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal rejecting the appellant's claim to a protection visa. 2 The basis upon which the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application to review was the failure of the appellant to appear on the day of the hearing.
 She included in the orders dismissing the application a notation to the effect that pursuant to r 16.05(2)(a) the Court may vary or set aside a judgment or order made in the absence of a party.
 Further, pursuant to O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules leave to appeal must be sought within 21 days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory decision, and the appellant must also obtain an extension of time.
 In particular, in breach of directions given on 19 March 2007, no written submissions have been filed on behalf of the appellant. 5 When the matter was called on for hearing this morning, there was no appearance by the appellant.
 Those letters again referred to medical certificates as being attached, but only one of the letters in fact provided such a certificate which was pro forma in nature and, as I have found, worthless. 7 Having regard to the history of this matter, I am not persuaded that I should adjourn this proceeding.
 See generally NACA v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [15] per Hely J; MZWQH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1491 at [26] per Kenny J; and MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J. 8 It follows that the objection to competency will be allowed.
