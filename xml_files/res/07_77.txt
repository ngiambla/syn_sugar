 The respondent resisted the claim on the basis that since the applicant demanded the return of the money, he has had to consider the basis of the applicant's claim and competing claims of potential owners of the money.
 This aspect of the defence is based on a notice from the Commissioner of Taxation the respondent received on or about 7 June 2006, issued pursuant to s 260-5 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) in relation to the money. 5 Initially the respondent contended the application did not engage the jurisdiction of this Court given that it was only a claim in detinue.
 A declaration that, as between the applicant and the respondent, the applicant is entitled to possession of the $130,000.00 taken from him on 18 February 2004. 8 At the hearing, counsel for the respondent accepted that, in principle, a person who is in possession of property, such as the applicant, can assert a right of possession against the whole world except the true owner.
 But when Howie J made the order of 21 July 2006 the provision in s 3ZV ("Subject to any contrary order of a court") was enlivened. 15 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the applicant presently does not have a right to immediate possession as against the respondent.
