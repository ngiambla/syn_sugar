 I will use the expression "Scheme Shares" to refer to those APN Shares that are held by the Offeree Shareholders. 5 The consideration payable by INMAL ("the Scheme Consideration") is $6.20 per Scheme Share, less the amount of any dividend to be paid by APN in respect of the year ended 31 December 2006 ("APN Dividend").
 The Scheme is Recommended by the APN Independent Committee 18 When the Consortium, including INM, approached APN in October 2006 with a view to acquiring the Scheme Shares, the directors of APN formed a committee consisting of those directors not affiliated with INM (numbering six) to assess the proposal ("APN Independent Committee").
 The APN Independent Committee unanimously recommends that the Offeree Shareholders agree to the Scheme in the absence of a superior proposal, and the members of that Committee intend to vote in favour of the Scheme in respect of APN shares held by them or on their behalf, in the absence of a superior proposal.
