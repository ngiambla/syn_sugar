 In so far as this provision applies, it would raise a presumption that the statutory demand in the present case was received at Unit 3 on Monday 4 December 2006. 19 Section 5C of the Corporations Act provides, relevantly, that the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ("the Acts Interpretation Act ") applies to the Corporations Act .
 In fact, subs (2) of s 29 of the Acts Interpretation Act has the effect that it is the "fourth working day" period specified in s 160(1) of the Evidence Act that applies, because, by reason of subs (2), s 29 is not permitted to affect the operation of s 160 of the Evidence Act .
 In any event, the defendant's submission is simply that the plaintiff is not in a position to rely on either statutory provision as to time because, on the evidence, the statutory demand was not delivered to Unit 3 at all. 31 In my view, the defendant has not adduced "evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption" in terms of s 160(1) of the Evidence Act (or, a fortiori , "proved" the contrary of the deemed time of service provision of the Acts Interpretation Act ). 32 I do not know why Mr Vane did not receive the statutory demand.
 A similar observation would apply, mutatis mutandis , to the deemed time of service provision found in the second limb of s 29(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act . 36 Counsel for the parties referred me to several authorities on the statutory provisions to which I have referred, in factual contexts in which mail addressed to a company's registered office was deposited in its Post Office box rather than delivered by post to the registered office.
