 Notwithstanding that the population of India is approximately one billion people, the Appellant contended in oral evidence at a hearing on 27 November 2003 that if one person saw him it might well be sufficient so as to identify and locate him especially since members of his wife's family might possibly identify him.
 The Appellant is an adherent of the Roman Catholic faith. (b) The Tribunal did not accept the Appellant's contention that he met and married a woman from a high caste Brahmin Hindu family in 1999. (c) The Tribunal found the Appellant's evidence concerning his meeting with his contended wife and their subsequent marriage implausible.
 The Tribunal observed that the Appellant was unable to provide the Tribunal with documents evidencing the contended marriage and nor was the Appellant in a position to provide documents evidencing the steps taken by the Appellant to institute proceedings in India for a divorce from his contended wife.
