 Yours faithfully. 6 Apparently for many years Mr Caldar looked after his mother. 7 The Public Trustee of New South Wales, the respondent to the intended application for special leave to appeal, was granted letters of administration of the estate of Mrs Gittoes with the will annexed on 20 May 2002, the surviving appointed executor named in the will having renounced his position.
 However, on 16 March 2005 Gummow J dismissed that summons. 13 There apparently followed extensive correspondence between Mr Caldar and officers of the Court in relation to Mr Caldar's wish to file another application for special leave to appeal. 14 The Public Trustee was at first disinclined to take any active part in these proceedings and indeed sought to be removed as a party.
