 Yours faithfully. 6 Apparently for many years Mr Caldar looked after his mother. 7 The Public Trustee of New South Wales, the respondent to the intended application for special leave to appeal, was granted letters of administration of the estate of Mrs Gittoes with the will annexed on 20 May 2002, the surviving appointed executor named in the will having renounced his position.
 He has had no success in the Supreme Court. 9 The amended application in this Court seeks orders that the Public Trustee, whom Mr Caldar had joined as a second respondent in his original application to this Court, should be removed as a party and that he should have "default judgment" on his claim that "his Special Leave to Appeal Application be removed into the High Court list. " He asks, "alternatively," although really as preliminary matters, that I should disqualify myself from further hearing his case in this Court and that the case be referred to a Full Court.
 However, on 16 March 2005 Gummow J dismissed that summons. 13 There apparently followed extensive correspondence between Mr Caldar and officers of the Court in relation to Mr Caldar's wish to file another application for special leave to appeal. 14 The Public Trustee was at first disinclined to take any active part in these proceedings and indeed sought to be removed as a party.
