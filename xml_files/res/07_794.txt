 It is simply impossible to tell from the price data about Andrianopoulos and Liberty whether they effected any price increases on the basis of any information they received from Mr Anderson, or from each other.

 Leahy rang BP Meredith twice and Gordon Primmer once, the calls being timed at one minute and 39 seconds, one minute and 48 seconds and four minutes and 20 seconds.
 On the other 16 occasions, it is possible to identify from Annexure B telephone communications between Apco and Leahy, or someone on their behalf, within 24 hours prior to the first of the price increases.
