 1 This is an application under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) for prerogative relief and a purported appeal on a question of law under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act').
 There would be no right of appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act because of s 483 of the Act. 9 The applicant seemed to submit that a decision infected by jurisdictional error was not a purported privative clause decision because it was in fact no decision at all.
 It was put to the Tribunal member that the applicant had been punished by imprisonment and should not be further punished by deportation, and even if he were, the visa cancellation process should be completed while he was still in prison.
