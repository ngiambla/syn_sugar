 Johnson arguendo [sic] , I take the view that the Tribunal considered there were two independent bases of the [appellant's] alleged fear, the first being a general fear of the type of arrest and mistreatment which the Tribunal itself accepted at (CB 81) might occur to any Sikh nationalist and the second, the more specific fear relating to the ammunition.
 There is no reason to think that the information provided in the appellant's visa application provided the basis for the Tribunal's findings concerning changes in the Punjab or the authorities' apparent lack of interest in the appellant. 29 However, it is necessary to 'unbundle' the Tribunal's reasons for decision to determine which of the grounds upon which the appellant claimed to fear persecution the Tribunal had in contemplation when it concluded that it was not satisfied that his fear was well-founded.
 Hence The Appellant seek that he should be granted justice by the Full Court by over-ruling both the decisions made by the Tribunal and the learned Federal Magistrate and issuing the appropriate Writs in favor of the [appellant] . ' 44 The appellant has not earlier advanced a claim to fear being arrested and charged with an offence under the Terrorism and Disturbance Act if he returns to India.
