 The Tribunal apparently then raised with the appellant that he had said in his statutory declaration that his grandfather had died in about 1994 from that assault, because the Tribunal records (again in terms which the appellant does not dispute) that in his evidence to the Tribunal the appellant sought to explain that by saying that the 1994 incident had contributed to the death of his grandfather.
 The statutory declaration accompanied the protection visa application, which identified the fear of persecution as being for his religious belief. 43 The second group of references identified by the appellant are contained in the written submission of the appellant's migration agent to the Tribunal of 11 April 2005.
