 This cause of action is referred to as the termination representation cause of action. 5 The second TPA cause of action is founded upon the publication by Oxus Gold on its website, which is downloadable in Australia, of a statement which refers to the issue of the notice of termination, and which repeats the allegation impugning the extent of the reserve at the Saulyak gold deposit.
 The applicants allege that the representations made in that statement were misleading or deceptive, and that the first applicant has suffered and is likely to suffer damage because the statement impugns the value of an important asset of the first applicant. 6 The third cause of action is that the applicants have suffered loss and damage by reason of the respondents' alleged repudiatory conduct in sending the notice of termination and the applicants' acceptance of that repudiation.
