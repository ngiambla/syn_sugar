 I also accept the evidence of Ms Kellie Willason that she was in no way involved with the hypothetical held on 27 March 2006. 30 There is more to be said about the topics of Mr Rana's allegations that he paid for tickets and of the events at the Convention Centre, but it is convenient to do that in the context of discussing the evidence of Ms McIver.
 An email message from Ms Kellie Willason to Mr Rana, allegedly sent on 24 April 2006, which suggests that the University received the sum of $350 from Mr Rana in relation to the hypothetical and wished to return it (exhibit "A" to Mr Rana's affidavit sworn on 1 May 2006). 3.
 As I understood Mr Rana's case, the conduct which he alleged was misleading or deceptive was the insertion of the advertisement in The Australian newspaper and the statements made by Ms Ellmers during her conversation with Mr Rana on the telephone.
