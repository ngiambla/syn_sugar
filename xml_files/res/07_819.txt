 1 This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrate which dismissed a judicial review application in relation to a Refugee Review Tribunal ("Tribunal"), decision which had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship refusing a protection visa. 2 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who claimed to fear persecution from the Awami League by reason of his involvement in the Bangladesh National Party ("BNP").
 In the absence of any indication by the decision-maker in the Tribunal to the contrary, the Court at [35] said that: '... unless some other additional issues are identified by the tribunal ... it would ordinarily follow that, on review by the tribunal, the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision-maker identified as determinative against the applicant. ' 4 In that case at [47] the Court noted that there should be an indication by the Tribunal sufficient to show that what an appellant says in support of the application is in issue.
 I have considered the reasons for decision of the Tribunal and the transcript and other documents included in the appeal papers and, having regard to the transcript in particular and to the letter sent to the appellant by the Tribunal, I consider that the appellant was sufficiently alerted, from the manner and content of the questioning, the information sought and the reasons given for seeking that information, to the issues of concern to the Tribunal member.
 In relation to other matters there are comments and reasons given and conclusions reached in relation to the appellant's overall credibility which are adverse to the appellant. 6 In my view and on my reading of the material I am not persuaded that there has been any reviewable error shown in the reasoning of the Tribunal, or in the approach taken by it in conducting the hearing and eliciting information, or informing the appellant of the matters which were in dispute.
