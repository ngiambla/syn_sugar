 There seems to be no dispute that the annual revenue for the following year was approximately $300,000 and so the difference between 2004 and 2003 is somewhere between $1,200,000 (on Mr Meredith's figures) and $900,000 (on Mr McCarthy's figures).
 Assuming that revenue is earned evenly throughout the year, the difference (ie loss) for the period between 20 January 2004 and 16 February 2004 (27 days) is between $87,096.77 (($1,200,000 / 12) x 27/31) and $65,322.58 (($900,000 / 12) x 27/31). 17 To this point I have not considered adjustments arising from factors other than the loss of the VicSuper business.
