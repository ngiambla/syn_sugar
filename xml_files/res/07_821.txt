 1 This case concerns the manner in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT) dealt with claims for legal professional privilege made pursuant to s 42 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (the FOI Act).
 Devereaux has filed a notice of contention supporting the release of the documents on grounds other than those found by the AAT and has cross-appealed in relation to the refusal to release the other documents sought.
 I cannot see any basis upon which it could be said that the production of the documents relied upon for waiver pursuant to a request under the FOI Act could be said to amount to conduct by the Commissioner inconsistent with maintenance of the confidentiality of the underlying advices.
