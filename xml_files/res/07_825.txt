 The applicant contended by its statement of claim, filed in the Federal Court on 2 March 2007, that throughout the 1990s and between 2000 and 2002, it purchased, and subsequently integrated into its computers, hard disk drives that were manufactured by the first respondent Fujitsu Ltd, or its subsidiaries, and imported into Australia by the first and/or the second respondent Fujitsu Australia Ltd, which is an Australian resident corporation.
 Furthermore, the second respondent is said to have been engaged at all material times in business in Australia by way of importing computer related products, including hard disk drives, manufactured by the first respondent or its subsidiaries and making wholesale sales of those and other products. 3 At the first directions hearing on 28 March 2007, the applicant sought leave, pursuant to Order 8 rule 3 of the Federal Court Rules , to serve an originating process on the first respondent in Japan.
 I directed that the matter be set down for interlocutory hearing on 9 May 2007 in order to consider further that application for service out of the jurisdiction. 4 As outlined in the application filed with the Federal Court on 2 March 2007 and later described in the applicant's written submissions, the applicant's claims against the first respondent are based, in part, on an allegation that the first respondent is liable for the conduct of its agent and wholly owned subsidiary the second respondent.
 The term ' causes of action ' in item 1 was asserted to carry the same meaning as it did in relation to the previous Order 8 rule 1, as construed in Distillers Co (Biochemical) Ltd v Thompson [1971] NSWLR 83 at 90, the correct approach being to ' ask the question, where in substance did this cause of action arise '.
