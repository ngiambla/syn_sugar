 The Refugee Review Tribunal breached s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), in that the information provided by the Appellant in his Statutory Declaration sworn 10 February 2003 in support of his protection visa application was not republished to the Tribunal and accordingly that information does not fall within the exception in s. 424A(3). ' For the reasons set out hereunder the Court granted leave to the appellant to rely on the Amended Notice of Appeal.
 These facts suggest that the statutory declaration was not regarded by the appellant as being significant in his application before the Tribunal. 22 The appellant was questioned extensively in relation to the contents of his statutory declaration and in its findings the Tribunal relied on four specific events each of which were material to his claim for refugee status and which were found to be inconsistent with the evidence the appellant gave orally at the hearing.
 The fact that the appellant did not have his statutory declaration with him at the hearing supports the inference that the appellant did not intend to adopt or republish the claims made therein 25 McHugh J in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [63] referred to the rationale underlying the statutory requirements of s 424A(1) of the Act in relation to evidence adverse to an appellant provided by a third party.
