 They say that listing of the GenRx products under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the treatment of mild to severe congestive heart failure was obtained on the basis that the effect of carvedilol in the products on decreasing mortality arising from congestive heart failure was shown to be cost justified having regard to such a clinical outcome.
 The Patentees contend, therefore, that, since GenRx obtained listing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as a bio equivalent of the Patentees' products, they have done so on the basis that the cost-justification for the listing of GenRx's products under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is a decrease in mortality for patients suffering from congestive heart failure.
 As I have indicated, the GenRx product information sheet refers to death. 90 The Patentees also contend that, by offering to supply the GenRx products in the dosage forms specifically referable to treatment of congestive heart failure, GenRx is authorising the use of its products for the treatment of congestive heart failure.
