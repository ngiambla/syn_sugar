 Two earlier decisions were set aside by consent. 4 The applicant claimed to fear persecution in his native China as a Falun Gong practitioner who had been detained and tortured. 5 The Tribunal, in a probable effort to ensure that there was no third mishap by it, caused two letters to be sent to the applicant in advance of the hearing which was fixed for 24 August 2006.
 The applicant responded to this on 16 August 2006, indicating that he did want to come to the hearing. 6 In the meantime, on 3 August 2006, the Tribunal wrote to the applicant, seeking his comment on information that, subject to any comments he might make, would be the reason or part of the reason for deciding he was not entitled to the protection visa which he sought.
 The applicant told the Court below that he had not attended the hearing because he was ill, that he had obtained a medical certificate, given it to his migration agent and advised that agent of his illness a day before the hearing, the inference being that he left it to the agent to notify the Tribunal and seek an adjournment.
