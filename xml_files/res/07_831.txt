 The applicant needs to satisfy the Court (1) whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by an appellate court; and (2) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong.
 The applicant, who appeared in person, did not put before me any material upon which I might conclude that the orders made below are attended with sufficient doubt to warrant them being reconsidered by this Court.
 That circumstance alone would be sufficient to lead to the conclusion that it was just not possible to conclude that the decision below was attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by this Court, but when that is coupled with the fact that the making of the orders was pursuant to the exercise of a discretion and that there was no material to suggest that the discretion miscarried, one is impelled to conclude that any appeal has no prospects of success.
 I was informed by counsel for the respondent that the making of these orders was a precursor to an application by the respondent that the applicant provide security for costs in respect of the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court and that such an application had been filed in that court subsequent to the making of the orders from which the application for leave to appeal is made today.
