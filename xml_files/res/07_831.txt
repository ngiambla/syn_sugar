 The applicant needs to satisfy the Court (1) whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by an appellate court; and (2) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong.
 I was informed by counsel for the respondent that the making of these orders was a precursor to an application by the respondent that the applicant provide security for costs in respect of the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court and that such an application had been filed in that court subsequent to the making of the orders from which the application for leave to appeal is made today.
