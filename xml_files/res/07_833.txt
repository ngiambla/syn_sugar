 In each relevant case the witness annexes a copy of the witness statement to an affidavit sworn and then deposes that: 'The statement was and remains, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true and correct, -' and in some cases amendments or additions are then made.
 Dr Renwick did not rely upon any specific part of the Federal Court Rules in that connection and I have not been able myself to identify a rule which would fall directly within the contemplation of s 37(3) of the Evidence Act .
 The material which is sought to be relied upon is evidence of a previous representation and, on one view at least, is for that reason hearsay and, subject to relevant exceptions, prima facie inadmissible by reason of the hearsay rule incorporated in s 59 of the Evidence Act .
