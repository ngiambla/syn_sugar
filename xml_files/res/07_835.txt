 The assertion by Qantas Catering was that the monies paid to her were greatly in excess of the wages to which she was entitled for the hours that she worked, and the allowances to which she was entitled. 16 Ms Holness pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, as did a number of other employees of Qantas Catering in the Brisbane Flight Catering Centre. 17 Mrs Barrick says she, like Qantas Catering, was a victim of the fraudulent conduct of the pay-mistress.
 Qantas Catering says that the evidence establishes that Mrs Barrick was "in cahoots with Mrs Holness" and that her dishonesty can be demonstrated in many significant respects by the objective evidence. 18 One of the many difficulties confronting the applicant in the Federal Court proceedings is the extent and nature of other litigation involving the contention that Mrs Barrick had fraudulently received monies from Qantas Catering to which she was not entitled.
 Mrs Barrick asserts that Ms Holness had fraudulently obtained the loan in Mrs Barrick's name using details from Mrs Barrick's personnel file, and the deductions made through Mrs Barrick's wages can be traced to this "fraudulent loan". 58 Mrs Barrick says that in March of 1997, she received demands from Capital Finance in respect of instalments on a loan taken out by Ms Holness in Mrs Barrick's name.
 Qantas Catering submitted that the falsification of payslips by Ms Holness does not establish a breach of the Award. 114 I accept that the actions of Ms Holness in changing the pay roll, or in dishonestly issuing number 2 payslips to avoid detection of the fraudulent overpayment she was making to employees, including the applicant, are not to be taken as the actions of the respondent. 115 I accept also that the payslips accurately record the amounts credited to the applicant.
