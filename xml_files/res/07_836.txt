 Consequently, the application should be dismissed. 15 I note that Mr Kumar, who appeared for the appellant on this appeal, said from the Bar Table that the statement in the first sentence in [36] of the Federal Magistrate's reasons was incorrect.
 Selway J however went on to observe in SGBB (at [17]): 'But this does not mean the application is to be treated as an exercise in 19 th Century pleading. ' His Honour noted that the Full Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1801 at [49] had said: 'The Tribunal must, of course, deal with the case raised by the material and evidence before it.
 But as the Full Court said in WAEE (at [45]): If the tribunal fails to consider a contention that the applicant fears persecution for a particular reason which, if accepted, would justify concluding that the applicant has satisfied the relevant criterion, and if that contention is supported by probative material, the tribunal will have failed in the discharge of its duty, imposed by s 414 to conduct a review of the decision.
 These other claims were not expressly addressed by the Tribunal in its reasons. 30 The appellant advanced a further ground seeking to impugn the decision of the Tribunal and consequently the decision of the Federal Magistrate. 31 It was submitted that the Tribunal had used information contained from a "passenger movement" file in the departmental file.
