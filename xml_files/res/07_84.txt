 The meeting approved the proposed scheme of arrangement, subject to the approval of the Court, under s 411(4)(b) of the Corporations Act , by passing the appropriate resolution by a majority of 98.37 per cent of the members present by voting in favour of the resolution. 'No encumbrances' clause 4 Clause 7.3(a) of the scheme of arrangement deals with the title to and rights in the plaintiff's shares and provides: 'The [plaintiff's] shares transferred under the Scheme will be transferred free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise. ' 5 This clause has been referred to as a 'no encumbrances' clause.
 In my view, it is no answer to this objection to say that a security holder's fears would be immediately allayed upon its being informed that cl 9.3(b) did not go beyond describing the position that prevails at law, in any event, and that in relation to the security interest the clause might just as well have been omitted.
 Clause 16.5 of the plaintiff's constitution deals with the time for service and provides that where a notice is sent by post the service of the notice is taken to be effected, in the case of a notice of a general meeting, on the day after the day of posting.
 Therefore, in accordance with s 1322(2) of the Corporations Act , the meeting is not invalidated because of the procedural irregularity in the giving of the inadequate period of notice. 13 As to s 411(17) of the Corporations Act , the plaintiff produced in evidence a letter from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, issued in accordance with s 411(17)(b) of the Corporations Act , stating that the Commission had no objection to the scheme of arrangement on the basis that it was satisfied that it had not been proposed for the purpose of enabling any person to avoid the operation of any of the provisions of Ch 6 of the Corporations Act . 14 For the abovementioned reasons, I made orders approving the scheme of arrangement, subject to the deletion of cl 7.3(a) of the scheme of arrangement.
