 The meeting approved the proposed scheme of arrangement, subject to the approval of the Court, under s 411(4)(b) of the Corporations Act , by passing the appropriate resolution by a majority of 98.37 per cent of the members present by voting in favour of the resolution. 'No encumbrances' clause 4 Clause 7.3(a) of the scheme of arrangement deals with the title to and rights in the plaintiff's shares and provides: 'The [plaintiff's] shares transferred under the Scheme will be transferred free from all mortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, whether legal or otherwise. ' 5 This clause has been referred to as a 'no encumbrances' clause.
 In my view, it is no answer to this objection to say that a security holder's fears would be immediately allayed upon its being informed that cl 9.3(b) did not go beyond describing the position that prevails at law, in any event, and that in relation to the security interest the clause might just as well have been omitted.
