 1 A motion was filed in this Court on 22 May 2007 on behalf of Charles Zentai in connection with proceedings between Mr Zentai and the Republic of Hungary relating to the request by the Republic of Hungary for his extradition from Australia in relation to an alleged war crime committed during the course of the Second World War.
 That appeal was dismissed by the Full Court and an application for special leave to the High Court is pending. 2 On 8 July 2005, Mr Zentai was arrested in Perth pursuant to a warrant for arrest under Section 12(1) of the Extradition Act .
 So the constitutional questions raised did not fall for consideration by the Full Court. 7 On 11 May 2007 Mr Zentai filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Full Federal Court.
 In any event, as I held in Trade Practices Commission v Manfal Pty Ltd (1990) 27 FCR 284, the section is not applicable where there is a pending application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.
