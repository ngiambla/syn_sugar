 Neither cl 17 nor cl 45.8.2 of the Certified Agreement imposes on the first respondent an obligation not to appoint to any classification a person without the qualifications or experience found in the definition of that classification.
 Similarly, cl 53.10 of the Certified Agreement, to the extent to which it imposes any obligation on the first respondent, is silent on the question of who may, or may not, be appointed to any of the classifications.
 Certainly, there is no warrant for giving the word "service" in that context a meaning restricted to a service in the employ of the first respondent, or service in employment the terms and conditions of which are regulated by the Award.
