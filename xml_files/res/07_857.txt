 Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd (GSS) and Landmark School Supplies Pty Ltd (Landmark) have brought an action (proceeding VID 691 of 2006) against two of GSS' directors, Mr and Mrs Dean, their company Dean School Supplies Pty Ltd and several other defendants.
 In the parallel proceeding it is alleged that the defendants misused Landmark's intellectual property and copyright in certain works that are similar to the works described in the principal action.
 Still, there is a significant degree of similarity between Landmark's action and the principal action, at least as regards the information that is alleged to be confidential and the works that are said to be copyright.
 By this I mean that if the allegations against the Deans and their co-defendants are made good, the claim by Landmark will succeed and there is little, if anything, additional that GSS could recover in a separate action.
