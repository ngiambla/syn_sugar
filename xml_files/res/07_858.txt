 On 20 September 2006 the plaintiff entered into a contract with the company to purchase for $780,000 a parcel of land at Noosaville.
 The plaintiff paid the deposit of $39,000 to the company's estate agent and was to pay the balance at settlement which was due on 20 November 2006.
 A few days later the plaintiff's solicitor advised the liquidator of the existence of the contract and provided him with a copy.
 The agent did seek instructions from the liquidator but was told that as the mortgagee had entered into possession the liquidator "now [has] no role to pay in determining whether the contract that has been exchanged can be completed".
