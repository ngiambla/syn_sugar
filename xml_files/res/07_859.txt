 The applicant receives a service pension, the rate of which is calculated by reference to, among other things, the assets he owns. 4 The applicant owns a Toyota Prado motor vehicle and a camper trailer.
 The word "asset" is defined as follows: "property or money (including property or money outside Australia). " 6 Section 52 of the VE Act lists a number of assets which are to be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets.
 Both came within the definition of "assets", as contained in the VE Act , and had been properly brought to account as assets of the applicant and his wife. 9 The Tribunal affirmed the decisions under review.
 Assets designed for use by persons who are not disabled, such as the motor vehicle or camper trailer in this case, do not become assets designed for use by a disabled person because of the intention of the owner or disabled person or the particular way in which it is used by a person.
