 HIS HONOUR 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given by Driver FM dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") which was adverse to the appellant. 2 The appellant based his claim for refugee status on his alleged fear of persecution by the Chinese Government because he was an adherent of the Falun Gong doctrines and movement.
 The copy must be given to the applicant: (a) within 14 days after the day on which the decision is handed down; and (b) by one of the methods specified in section 441A. " Section 430D(1) provides: If the Tribunal gives an oral decision on an application for review, the Tribunal must give the applicant and the Secretary a copy of the statement prepared under subsection 430(1) within 14 days after the decision concerned is made.
 The applicant is taken to be notified of the decision on the day on which the decision is made. 4 His Honour accepted the submission of the first respondent that the only relevant consequence of a breach of s 430B(6) was to suspend the running of time for the purposes of the statutory time limits on judicial review and that no jurisdictional error arose.
