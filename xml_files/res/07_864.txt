 In relation to claim 7, the dispute concerns the relationship of claim 7 to claim 1 and the meaning of the words 'the water line is substantially constant in the case of the sternward quarter part of the vessel'. 6 The invention relates to a hull structure for a multi-hull ship.
 Moreover, the Crowther and Austal designs do not have a hull the width of which at the water line is substantially greater in the aft body than in the forward body, and thus can be said to generally decrease in a forward direction.
