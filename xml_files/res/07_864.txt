 In relation to claim 7, the dispute concerns the relationship of claim 7 to claim 1 and the meaning of the words 'the water line is substantially constant in the case of the sternward quarter part of the vessel'. 6 The invention relates to a hull structure for a multi-hull ship.
 Moreover, the Crowther and Austal designs do not have a hull the width of which at the water line is substantially greater in the aft body than in the forward body, and thus can be said to generally decrease in a forward direction.
 He sees the essence of the patent being in the fact that the hull shape has a low centre of buoyancy in the forward part of the hull, with a significantly lower than average water plane area, combined with a higher centre of buoyancy in the aft part of the hull, with a high water plane area increasing from forward to aft.
