 1 This morning in Court Mr Perry for the applicants made two applications. 2 The first application is that I grant leave for the applicants to file and serve written submissions by tomorrow. 3 The second application is that I adjourn the hearing of oral submissions until such time as written submissions have been filed and read by the respondents and the Court. 4 The last sitting day of this matter was 16 May 2007, almost three weeks ago.
 On 11 May 2007 I ordered the parties to each file and serve written submissions in this matter by 25 May 2007, with a view to the parties returning on 5 June 2007 to make oral submissions to the Court.
 The Further Amended Statement of Claim consists of a large number of separate representations and the evidence in support of each of the representations was not able to be incorporated into the Written Submissions by that time. 3.
 I disagree. 21 While clearly it would have been convenient to have had the written submissions of the applicant a week prior to today's hearing as envisaged by my directions, in my view the only procedural unfairness that arises from the applicants' failure to file their written submissions has been to the respondents.
