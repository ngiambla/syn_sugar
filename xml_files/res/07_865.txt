 It is unfortunate that valuable Court time is being spent on this issue. 20 Mr Perry has submitted that it is critical that I have the written submissions of the applicants and that I have digested them prior to hearing oral submissions by way of closing address.
 I disagree. 21 While clearly it would have been convenient to have had the written submissions of the applicant a week prior to today's hearing as envisaged by my directions, in my view the only procedural unfairness that arises from the applicants' failure to file their written submissions has been to the respondents.
 Mr Bell has already indicated that the respondents are prepared to proceed today notwithstanding the failure of the applicants to file and serve written submissions. 22 It is common practice in this Court, as has already been pointed out, for Counsel to orally address the Court by way of closing submissions at the conclusion of evidence, after which some judges require written submissions.
