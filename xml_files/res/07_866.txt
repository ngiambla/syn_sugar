 The principal purpose of the definition of each of PTSD and alcohol dependence is to permit a determination as to whether the SoP applies to the condition as found by the Tribunal, presumably upon the basis of a clinical diagnosis.
 Although the anterior question is separate from that as to whether the SoP applies, if the condition found is characterised by criteria which differ from those in the SoP, the claim will fail because the SoP will not apply.
 There is nothing in the operation of the relevant provisions of the VEA which requires the SoP definition to be utilised by the decision-maker in determining the existence and nature of the DSM-IV classified condition.
 There was evidence which supported the finding, including that of Dr Rogers who regarded the conditions as related and the heavy consumption of alcohol to have followed upon the latter of the incidents in Vietnam.
