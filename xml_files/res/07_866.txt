 The principal purpose of the definition of each of PTSD and alcohol dependence is to permit a determination as to whether the SoP applies to the condition as found by the Tribunal, presumably upon the basis of a clinical diagnosis.

 There was evidence which supported the finding, including that of Dr Rogers who regarded the conditions as related and the heavy consumption of alcohol to have followed upon the latter of the incidents in Vietnam.
