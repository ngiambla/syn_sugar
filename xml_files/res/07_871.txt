 The Tribunal found that, if they were initially in a genuine spousal relationship, it deteriorated quickly after Mr Chey's arrival in Australia; that Mr Chey and Ms Tong separated in March 2003; and that Ms Tong's conduct in 2003 was the behaviour of a person frightened of Mr Chey.
 The Tribunal found: "...the parties concealed their true circumstances and declared false statements in their statutory declarations of 1 December 2003, gave false instructions to their agent (reflected in her submission of 1 December 2004) and declared false statements in their statutory declarations of October 2005.
 The Tribunal concluded: "Although the relationship resumed to the extent that [Ms Tong] has had a child the Tribunal is not satisfied that the relationship at the time of the decision has the degree of mutual support and companionship contemplated by regulation 1.15A.
 In light of this finding, it was open to the Tribunal to determine that it was unnecessary to say anything specifically about either any joint responsibility for care and support of their child (the subject of reg 1.15A(3)(b)(i)) or shared responsibility for housework (the subject of reg 1.15A(3)(b)(iii)).
