 Counsel for the applicant did not suggest how, in any way, the amount of the assessment made by the respondent under s 167 might have been affected by the knowledge of a potential Deed of Company Arrangement. 33 The proposed Deed of Company Arrangement is exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Charitopoulos of 29 May 2007.
 The annexures to Mr Charitopoulos' affidavit of 29 May 2007 records the distribution from the Charitopoulos Family Trust to the applicant of $122,074 for the year ended 30 June 2002 (as well as such smaller distributions from some other trusts).
