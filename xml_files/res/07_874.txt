 On 8 November 2005, the officer of the respondent dealing with the matter wrote to Mr Charitopoulos confirming what had been discussed on 20 October 2005, including the proposed issue of default assessments due to delays in the provision of information requested, and that the default assessments would take "at least six to more than eight weeks to issue".
 Counsel for the applicant did not suggest how, in any way, the amount of the assessment made by the respondent under s 167 might have been affected by the knowledge of a potential Deed of Company Arrangement. 33 The proposed Deed of Company Arrangement is exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Charitopoulos of 29 May 2007.
 The annexures to Mr Charitopoulos' affidavit of 29 May 2007 records the distribution from the Charitopoulos Family Trust to the applicant of $122,074 for the year ended 30 June 2002 (as well as such smaller distributions from some other trusts).
 The Reasons for Decision referred to also note that the applicant is part of the Golden Chef Group, and that the income tax return for the Charitopoulos Family Trust for the income year ended 30 June 2002 showed that that trust distributed its income to 30 June 2002 of $122,074 to the applicant.
