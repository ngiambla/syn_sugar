 BACKGROUND 1 This is a motion by the University of New South Wales ("University") to dismiss the proceeding brought by the applicant pursuant to various provisions in the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) ("Act"). 2 The applicant made an application to the Court on 7 December 2006, claiming that the University had unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of her race and ethnic origin.
 The application states that the claim is based on employment-related bullying, harassment, persecution and alienation which resulted in arrests on four occasions. 3 However, in addition to that claim, the applicant seeks a "Declaration of Right" that she is the owner of the University of New South Wales.
 In broad terms, under the Act it is unlawful to do any act involving a distinction based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of any human right.
 The applicant claims that she comes within this requirement. 14 Section 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) empowers the Court to give summary judgment against an applicant if it is satisfied that the applicant has "no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding".
