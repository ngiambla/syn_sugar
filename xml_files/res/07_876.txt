 Mrs Vanderpluym says that the real questions in the appeal are first, that in determining the assets value limit applicable to her, the debt due to Mr Vanderpluym by MMPL ought to have been disregarded as a matter of statutory construction of s 1118(1)(b) because the debt is supported by a 'vendor's lien' in favour of Mr Vanderpluym as unpaid transferor of the land to MMPL (and the lien extends to further advances for improvements); the lien is an 'interest' in the land and thus an interest in the residence being the principal home; and that interest as unpaid lien holder is an interest that 'gave' Mr Vanderpluym and Mrs Vanderpluym reasonable security of tenure in the home.
 The weekly tenancy arrangement coupled with occupation and payment of rent gave rise to an equitable interest in the sense that the tenant could secure an order for an equitable remedy in support of a tenancy at common law ( Chan Anor v Cresdon Proprietary Limited [1989] HCA 63 ; (1989) 168 CLR 242). 60 Section 11(4)(b) of the Social Security Act contemplates an 'interest' which is either a legal or an equitable interest.
 Although I have been referred to a range of cases in relation to the purposive construction adopted in relation to workers' compensation legislation as an analogue of a purposive approach appropriate to the construction of the provisions of the Social Security Act , there seems to be nothing inconsistent with the objects sought to be achieved by the Social Security Act in recognising that consistent with s 1118(1)(b) the right or interest of Mrs Vanderpluym (and her partner) in the residence as principal home ought to be disregarded in the calculation of the assets value limit on the one hand and the inclusion within the assets value limit of Mrs Vanderpluym of the value of the debt due to Mr Vanderpluym, on the other.
