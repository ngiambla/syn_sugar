 For the reasons that follow, it is apparent that in making that finding, the Tribunal erred in the proper construction of ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act .
 ANALYSIS (1) Proper construction of ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act 31 The phrase " kind of death met by the person " in s 120A(4) asks a causative question.
 Therefore, s 120A(4) is to be construed in a way that gives effect to the evident statutory objective of the Part and, in particular, s 120A(3). 35 What then is the purpose for which the question in s 120A(4) about the kind of death met by the person is being asked?
