 Reliance was placed on O 23 r 11(5) of the Federal Court Rules ("the Rules") which deals with the consequences of the rejection of an offer of compromise in circumstances where the rejecting party fails to obtain judgment in a sum more favourable than the terms of the offer.
 Although it may be accepted, in the present case, that the trial may have been somewhat shorter had the respondent conceded the breach of the lease, this, in my opinion, is not sufficient to warrant a departure from the consequences prescribed by O 23 r 11(5).
 The respondent's defence of its position in relation to the breach of the lease was at least arguable and it did not, in pursuing its defence, unreasonably prolong the trial. 8 The particular paragraph in the witness statement which it is said provoked the rectification claim related to correspondence and discussions between the parties "during the second half of 1997 and in 1998".
 They related to the witness's recollections as to why it was that he was disposed to accept or not oppose repeated assertions by the applicant that the respondent had an obligation, under the lease, to reinstate the building (including the foyer) at the end of the lease.
