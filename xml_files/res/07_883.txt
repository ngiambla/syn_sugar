 The letter to Mr Rahman was signed by Ms Anna Dobkin, an Assistant Compliance Officer in the Compliance Section of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. 4 Mr Rahman's complaint was that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited ('CBA') (of which the first and second respondents are officers) had by the conduct of the first and second respondents disclosed his personal information to Centrelink.
 Section 22 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) provides (in s 22(1)(a)): '(1) In any Act, unless the contrary intention appears: (a) expressions used to denote persons generally (such as "person", "party", "someone", "anyone", "no-one", "one", "another" and "whoever"), include a body politic or corporate as well as an individual. ' 24 This meaning yields to a contrary intention but none appears in s 192 or s 196 of the Social Security (Administration) Act .
 Even if he were to amend the application there would be no reasonable prospect that the application could succeed against the third respondent. 25 In my view Mr Rahman's contentions and his application, wherever they are, or might be, directed are misconceived and without any foundation.
