 If a book, proposed for publication in Australia, was found to incite Australians to go and fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Review Board would be entitled to find that the publication, in the language of the Code, 'incited ... in matters of crime'.
 The applicant argued that a finding as to the persons or class of persons to whom the books are published, or are intended or likely to be published, would enable and require the Review Board to then consider whether the characteristics of any of those people, taken together with the nature of the literature, makes the inciting and promoting in matters of crime and violence likely.
 The Attorney pointed out that, in Transport Publishing , the Literature Review Board of Queensland had prohibited the distribution of certain publications on the basis that they were, in the opinion of the Board, 'objectionable', as that term was defined in the Objectionable Literature Act 1954 (Qld) .
