 On or before 11 May 2007 the Applicants' solicitors shall post by ordinary mail to each of the group members identified in schedule 1 to these orders a notice of the Applicants' application for approval by the Court of the proposed settlement of the group proceeding against the Thirteenth Respondent pursuant to s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (the Act) in the form initialled by me and placed in a sealed envelope in the Court file marked with the words 'Not to be opened except by order of a Justice of the Federal Court of Australia'. 2.
 That any notice of objection filed pursuant to order 2 hereof, be placed in a sealed envelope in the Court file and marked with the words 'Not to be inspected by any person other than the applicants, the thirteenth respondent and their legal advisors without Order of the Court', and until further order of the Court, inspection of any such notice of objection be restricted to the applicants, the thirteenth respondent and their legal advisors. " 11 On 10 May 2007, I made further orders substituting the form of notice to be sent in accordance with para 1 of the orders of 4 May 2007. 12 The applicants' solicitors complied with the first order of the Orders made on 4 May 2007.
 Similarly, Jessup J stated that although the notion that a settlement should be 'fair and reasonable' seemed unobjectionable as a matter of principle, if that consideration was to inform the process of approval under s 33V, it should be because of its harmony with the scheme of Pt IVA of the Act and because it tended to achieve the implicit object of the section.
