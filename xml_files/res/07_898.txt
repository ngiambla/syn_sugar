 In formulating these reasons although they are, of course, directed to the parties, I particularly have in mind Mr Jakab as a self-represented litigant in the conduct of the appeal and in addressing the questions of law and factual matters relevant to the questions as formulated and in explaining the proper role of the Court in such an application.
 In this context, a reference to Meniere's Disease must be understood as a reference to the effects of the disease and not a reference to the disease itself (s 5D(2)(b)). 14 Section 196B(3) addresses whether a disease can be related to defence service and the factor or factors determined by means of a Statement of Principles that must exist before it can be said, on the balance of probabilities, that a disease is connected with defence service.
 Mr Jakab contends that the failure to diagnose the condition as Meniere's Disease evidenced by the effects of the condition on presentation to Air Force Medical Officers resulted in an inability on the part of Mr Jakab to obtain appropriate clinical management for the disease and thus the contention of a connection between the effects of the disease and Mr Jakab's Defence Force service is upheld by the Statement of Principles.
 Accordingly, Mr Jakab failed to establish that he suffered or contracted a disease during a period of defence service or prior to the last period of that service and that the disease was contributed to in a material degree or was aggravated by defence service. 28 In conducting an analysis of the factual matters, the AAT applied the correct statutory tests, addressed the correct questions and acted according to law.
