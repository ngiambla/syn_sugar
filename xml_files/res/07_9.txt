 For that reason the Tribunal stated that it would deal with the application on the basis that the appellant claimed to fear persecution based on his religion. 7 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant had been assaulted in the street and that this incident could have been associated with the proposed purchase of land for the Church but was satisfied that this was an isolated incident.
 Secondly, it was submitted that the Tribunal erred in misapplying the test for relocation. 14 The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant's first submission, noting that the Tribunal did not regard Coptic Christian lawyers as a particular social group and referring to the Tribunal's finding that the appellant's problems emerged as a result of the religious focus of his political activities and its findings about the circumstances surrounding the appellant's detention and alleged attempted torture. 15 In respect of the second ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal merely asked whether the applicant might be able to relocate, rather than whether he could or whether it would be reasonable to do so.
 Although the Tribunal mentioned that a psychologist who examined the appellant referred to the appellant's account as being one of detention and torture in 2002 the Tribunal did not dwell on this point and, as mentioned above, the Tribunal specifically stated that it was relying only on the account that the appellant gave at the hearing; see [5] above. 18 The appellant's primary submission in this Court is that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal misapplied the test for relocation, and in doing so made a jurisdictional error.
 The Tribunal thought it likely that the appellant had been perceived locally as a trouble maker and, in the passage quoted at [12], above the Tribunal made the important finding that 'the local police or authorities would [not] pursue the applicant to another city, or inform the authorities there of his presence'. 20 In the appellant's submission, this approach demonstrated that the Tribunal was distracted from the question that is at the heart of any enquiry as to whether a person is a refugee, namely does the person have a well-founded fear of future persecution should that person be returned to their own country.
