 The respondents have filed a defence denying the applicant's allegations and raising a cross-claim for removal of the applicant's marks from the Register under Pt 9 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) on the ground of non-use. 4 The respondents have moved for an order for security for costs in the sum of $300,000 and an order that issues of liability be determined prior to and separately from any issues of quantum.
 In the present case there is no question this Court has jurisdiction to make an order for security for costs against the applicant, which of course is a party; the problem for the respondents is that the statutory pre-condition for such an order has not been established. 19 Mr Campbell also referred to the decision of Austin J in Cresvale Far East Ltd (in liq) v Cresvale Securities Ltd (No 2) (2001) 39 ACSR 622.
 His Honour points out at [33] that "in normal circumstances costs are not awarded against a liquidator who is not a party, notwithstanding that the liquidator had the carriage of the litigation in the company's name and the proceedings have been lost. " His Honour goes on to say at [33]: "Another party to the proceedings may, of course, apply for security for costs.
 In substance, so it is said, the applicant is defending its property from attack: Maatschappij Voor Fondsenbezit v Shell Transport and Trading Co [1923] 2 KB 166 at 177, Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175, Re Travelodge Australia Ltd (1978) 21 ACTR 17. 25 In the event of the respondents' application being dismissed, the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis.
