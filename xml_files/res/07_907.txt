 The Tribunal summarised the facsimile in its decision as stating that ' the visa applicant was excluded from the Bachelor of Commerce degree at [the University] in February 2004 for failing to meet course requirements in semesters 1 and 2 of 2003 '.
 The letter stated that certification was required and that, as the University had found that the appellant did not achieve results that it considered to be at least satisfactory, the Tribunal may find that he was in breach of the condition. 12 The appellant, through his advisor, relevantly replied by facsimile on 13 April 2005 (erroneously dated 13 February 2005).
 While the absence of certification was a fact before the Tribunal, the decision was not based upon that fact, nor did it form the basis for the s 359A letter. 18 Accordingly, in failing to apply the correct test and in failing to comply with s 359A of the Act, the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error.
