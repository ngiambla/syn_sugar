 In fact his application was filed on 6 October 2005, so it was out of time by more than a year. 5 In an affidavit in support of his application to the Federal Magistrate the applicant said: "The tribunal dismissed my appeal, stating that I was out of time.
 The Federal Magistrate concluded that, as the applicant had only given evidence that he had filed his application to the Tribunal within 28 days of personally receiving the department's letter and had not indicated date on which he received the letter, there was, in any event, no evidence that the letter was received within the 21 to 28 days previous to 6 October 2005.
 He therefore needs an order under Order 52, Rule 5(3) that compliance with the time limit be dispensed with. 7 The only explanation that the applicant has offered for his delay in filing his notice of appeal is that he was looking for a migration agent.
