 RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS 20 The applicant acknowledges that the Minister would have been free to make her decision, under s 501(1) of the Act, without reference to the ICCPR, the CAT or any other international treaty which had not been incorporated in Australian domestic law.
 If, in making her decision, the Minister misconstrued a treaty obligation and this had a material bearing on her decision, she could be said to have failed to have regard to a relevant consideration (the obligation correctly construed) or had regard to an irrelevant consideration (the misunderstood obligation). 21 As counsel for the applicant readily conceded this aspect of his case confronted some significant difficulties.
 The second is that, in any event, the applicant, in written submissions to the Minister, did not seek to suggest that there was anything other than a "real risk" test to be applied in determining whether either or both of the ICCPR and the CAT were engaged.
