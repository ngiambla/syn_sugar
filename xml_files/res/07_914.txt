 For the year 1993/94 Erinbol was therefore claiming a total s 73B tax deduction of $89,910,591. 10 It was common ground in an agreed statement of facts provided to the Court that the material made available to the Board referred to activities to be conducted and moneys to be expended in relation to the project in the income years 1993/94 to 1997/98 inclusive and that the project commenced on 30 June 1994.
 It is not in dispute that by letters dated 5 February 2001 and 15 June 2001 the syndicate members, through Deutsche Bank and Candacal, asked the Board to provide notification that they had been jointly registered in relation to the IDGCC project in respect of the 1993/94 year of income.
 The Respondent Board expressly reserves its entitlement (both in these proceedings and in proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal) to adduce evidence and to make such legal and factual submissions as it sees fit, should the proceedings not be resolved in the manner sought by the Applicants on 5 June 2007. 18 As I observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McCaskey [2000] FCA 1037 ; (2000) 104 FCR 8 at 21 ([30]): The approach of the Court to the making of consent orders is informed by a general principle of judicial restraint.
