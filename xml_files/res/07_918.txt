 On 11 April 2007 I made an order under s 1323(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that, pending trial, the money in those accounts be frozen.
 First, relevantly, that ASIC is carrying on an investigation under the Australian Securities and Investments Commision Act 2001 (Cth) or the Corporations Act 2001 into whether a person (a "relevant person") has acted in contravention of the Corporations Act .
 The first (though not in the order it appears in the section) is that the relevant person (Mr Lee) is or may be liable to pay damages or compensation to an aggrieved person, that is a person who lost money in the scheme.
