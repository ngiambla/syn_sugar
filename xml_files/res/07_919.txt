 The documents referred to in category [12(f)] and category [12(g)] relate to its claim that the impugned sections of the MOP Act are invalid as being inconsistent with s 92 of the Constitution . 14 The respondent contends that the resolution of the case as pleaded does not require discovery of the categories of documents sought by the applicants.
 Accordingly, says the respondent, discovery of the disputed category of documents is not necessary for the resolution of the dispute, and if it is, when weighed against the burden to the respondent of complying with such an order, the discretion to order discovery should not be exercised. 20 It is necessary to examine the pleadings to discern what is in issue between the parties.
 The respondent goes on to say that it does not by reason of the statutory provisions, have a substantial degree of, or market power in the purchase market as pleaded. 31 It is apparent from para 9 of the defence, and other pleas in the defence, that the parties take a different view of the characterisation of s 22(1) and s 22(2) of the MOP Act.
