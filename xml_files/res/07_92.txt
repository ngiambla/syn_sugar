 The sale price was $951,000 plus GST, of which $682,321 was paid to the secured creditor, Quality Web Australia Pty Ltd (Quality). 6 On the following day, 7 January 2003, at the meeting of the creditors of Terraplanet convened under s 439A of the Act, the creditors resolved under s 439C(c) of the Act that Terraplanet be wound up.
 All four members have expressed their support for the Proposal and have agreed to the making of the present application to the Court. 21 Mr Collis states that he is not aware of any reason why he and Mr Palmer, the other Liquidator, should not be appointed as administrators of Terraplanet, and that no complaint or objection has been received by either of them from any creditor in the course of the winding up in respect of any action taken by them as liquidators.
 It has been suggested, however, that the Court should also have in mind considerations of commercial morality: see Re Data Homes Pty Ltd (in liq) [1972] 2 NSWLR 22; Re Depsun Pty Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 644; Foodcorp at 798-9. 23 I am satisfied that the Liquidators are appropriate persons to become administrators.
