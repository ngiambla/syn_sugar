 DECISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL 6 The applicant then made an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) for review of the penalty remission decision under Pt IVC of the Act.
 On 24 April 2007 Ms Humphries contacted the applicant by telephone to advise her that the AGS had received this TAXPACK 2001 from Mr Maloney and advised her that, contrary to the claim in her letter dated 12 April 2007, there were no additional pages on top of the TAXPACK 2001.
 The applicant having considered this document acknowledged that she had been shown this during the Tribunal hearing and also at the offices of the respondent in Northbridge Perth shortly after the first directions hearing in this matter.
 She maintained before me, however, that there were additional pages accompanying the TAXPACK 2001 which were not put before Lander J. 20 Ms Humphries affidavit sworn 1 May 2007 [5] encloses a letter to her from Mr Frank Maloney who questioned the applicant in the course of the Tribunal hearing.
