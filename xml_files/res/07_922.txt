 Overall, the structure was the same as that adopted for the York Street development. 15 Mr Dunphy returned his completed rollover application form together with his York Street promissory note to York Street Mezzanine.
 A short time later, that is on 1 August 2005, Ann Street Mezzanine issued Mr Dunphy with a promissory note having a face value of $100,000 and a maturity date of 1 August 2008.
 Corresponding book entries were made adjusting the inter-company liabilities between Ann Street Mezzanine, York Street Mezzanine, Scots Church and Ann Street Brisbane (the development companies) and Westpoint Corp (which also acted as group treasurer).
 Put in more formal language, the performance of the obligations by York Street Mezzanine under its agreement with Mr Dunphy was conditional upon at least the existence, if not the execution, of the agreement between Mr Dunphy and Ann Street Mezzanine.
