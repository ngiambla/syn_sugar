 Overall, the structure was the same as that adopted for the York Street development. 15 Mr Dunphy returned his completed rollover application form together with his York Street promissory note to York Street Mezzanine.
 Corresponding book entries were made adjusting the inter-company liabilities between Ann Street Mezzanine, York Street Mezzanine, Scots Church and Ann Street Brisbane (the development companies) and Westpoint Corp (which also acted as group treasurer).
