 PROCEEDING BEFORE THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 9 Mr Genovese contended below that judgments and orders made by the former Local Court of Western Australia ("Local Court") and not extracted before 2 May 2005 (the 'transition date') at which time the Local Court became the Magistrates Court of Western Australia ("Magistrates Court") could not be relied upon in bankruptcy proceedings because any judgment or orders extracted after the transition date were judgments or orders of the Magistrates Court and not the Local Court.
 It follows, Mr Genovese contended, that a judgment or orders obtained from the Magistrates Court was not a judgment or orders of the 'Court' for the purposes of Regulation 1.03(1) under the Bankruptcy Regulations . 10 By the Courts Legislation Amendment and Repeal Act 2004 (WA) (the Courts Repeal Act), the Local Courts Act 1904 (WA) (the Local Courts Act ) was repealed.
 The date of the commencement of the Magistrates Court and its civil jurisdiction and the abolition of the Local Court and the repeal of its civil jurisdiction was the transition date to which I have referred. 11 The orders referred to above, and made prior to the transition date, were not extracted until 3 January 2006, being a date after the transition date.
 Each was sealed with the seal of the Magistrates Court under the signature of a person purporting to be a Registrar of the Magistrates Court. 12 Mr Genovese submitted that the Magistrates Court had no jurisdiction to issue any judgments or orders "for and on behalf of" the former Local Court and this because of the terms of s 7 of the Courts Repeal Act.
