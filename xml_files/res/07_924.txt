 It was said by Dr Gray that, in reliance on the University's conduct and the representations made by Professor Barber, Dr Gray and Sirtex and any venture partner were entitled to act on the basis that the University asserted no financial or other interest.
 It was also alleged that the University had either waived any breach by Dr Gray of its Patent Regulations and Intellectual Property Regulations or was estopped from asserting any interest in the intellectual property. 16 In its amended reply, in [20(c)], the University pleaded a new set of representations said to have been made by Dr Gray.
 The University says no issues of prejudice arise. 29 In relation to the representations the University says that in their respective defences Dr Gray and Sirtex plead various equitable defences and the Limitation Act .
 The University has already pleaded the making of representations by Dr Gray said to disentitle him and Sirtex to the benefit of equitable defences or to preclude their reliance on provisions of the Limitation Act .
