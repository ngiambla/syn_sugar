 I do not suggest, by this, that any of the terms of the Construction Contract have been incorporated into the performance guarantees. 6 The affidavit of Mr Malcolm Rutter sworn 15 June 2007 provides a very detailed account of the background to the Construction Contract and what has occurred since its execution.
 BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 46 The Banks raise the following issues in this respect: (a) whether damages from ONGC would be an adequate remedy for any loss which Clough might suffer; (b) whether the Federal Court will issue an anti-suit injunction against ONGC to prevent ONGC suing the Banks in India.
 Unless there is an anti-suit injunction, the Banks are exposed to the significant prospect of being sued for the guaranteed amounts in India and being ordered to pay these amounts in contravention of the Federal Court's injunction; (c) even if an anti-suit injunction is issued, whether this will offer adequate protection to the Banks against being sued in India.
 The Status Quo 52 As between Clough and ONGC I have already concluded, when granting an interim interlocutory injunction against ONGC that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of an injunction because the evidence demonstrated how Clough would be irreparably affected (both financially and through an adverse impact on its reputation) if ONGC were to press its demands and secured payment under the performance guarantees.
