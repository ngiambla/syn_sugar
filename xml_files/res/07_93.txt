 In those circumstances, the matter was adjourned with a direction that the applicant file an amended statement of claim. 8 During that hearing there was additional argument about documents that had been requested by the second and third respondents.
 The second and third respondents submitted that the complaints in the statement of claim related to dealings between them or their clients and the applicant, in relation to the Andrew Garrett Family Trust and the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 2.
 Lastly, he has sought an order that the Court record be altered to reflect his standing as applicant as managing trustee of the Andrew Group of Trusts. 32 The notice of motion was supported by a document entitled 'Submissions of Andrew Morton Garrett ATF The Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3'.
 The proposed amended application asserts that the application is brought by the applicants in their capacities as sole trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3 and in their capacities as Joint Trustees of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust and the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 2 and the Springwood Park Unit Trust.
