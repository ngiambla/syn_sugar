 On Wednesday, 13 June 2007, the solicitor for the applicants Mr Black of the firm Drakopoulos Black suffered a cardiac event, underwent an operation and had a stent inserted in his coronary artery.
 The present dates for trial commencing on 25 June 2007 were allocated with a view to ensuring that the matter would be able to proceed and be completed without any risk of any further adjournment. 4 The Court however is sympathetic to the circumstances confronting both Mr Black and the applicants by reason of Mr Black's cardiac event.
