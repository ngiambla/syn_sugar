 1 I have before me six applications by each applicant in the following proceedings, namely, QUD61/2007 Jennifer Maree Kennedy v Commissioner of Taxation ; QUD62/2007 Jennifer Maree Kennedy v Commissioner of Taxation ; QUD63/2007 Rodney John Kennedy v Commissioner of Taxation ; QUD64/2007 Rodney John Kennedy v Commissioner of Taxation ; QUD65/2007 Kennedy Haulage (Qld) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation ; and QUD66/2007 Kennedy Haulage (Qld) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation , for the exercise of the Court's discretion under s 14ZZO of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) ('TAA') for leave to amend the grounds of objection made by each applicant in a taxation objection in relation to an appealable objection decision to an assessment issued by the Commissioner of Taxation. 2 Leave is sought to introduce the following further ground: 'The decision to assess penalty made under Div 298 in schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA) was not duly made in accordance with law, is thereby a nullity, and is thereby excessive within s 14ZZO TAA in that no debt is owed to the Commonwealth under it: McAndrew v FC of T [1956] HCA 62 ; (1956) 98 CLR 263'. 3 The respondent does not oppose the making of the order in each application although the respondent makes it plain that the proposed ground is contested and will in part constitute the controversy between the parties. 4 Accordingly, I propose to grant leave to amend the ground of objection in each application in the above terms. 5 I propose to make the following further directions: 1.
 The applicant shall file and serve a Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions and any Affidavits upon which the applicant intends to rely at the hearing of the appeal in relation to the appealable objection decision on or before 31 August 2007. 8.
