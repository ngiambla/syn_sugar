 It argues that the documents were created in the course of an ongoing business relationship between the parties, rather than for the dominant purpose of legal assistance or obtaining material for use in legal proceedings. 14 Hoy further submits that it is a fair inference that an important purpose for most of the communications was the formulation of a commercial strategy or the taking of steps in the future management of the franchise relationship.
 Hoy submits the evidence indicates that the communication was for the purpose of dealing with the dispute by progressing through dispute resolution procedures required by the franchise agreement, which requires the parties to resolve disputes commercially in order to enhance their future business relationship.
 In short, it is highly improbable, having regard to the context, history and evidence in the matter, that the communications were made for the dominant purpose of contemplated legal proceedings because such proceedings could not properly be contemplated before commercial decisions, strategies and dispute resolution procedures had been conducted, agreed upon or dismissed.
 WAIVER BY DISCLOSURE 20 Hoy also claims that by a letter of 7 July 2006 Allphones waived legal professional privilege in any legal advice referred to in that letter by disclosing the substance of that advice. 21 The letter in question is from Mr Donnellan, Chief Executive Officer of Allphones, to Mr Birch.
