 The manager is to act under the direction, supervision and control of the trustee. 7 Among the trustee's duties are the duties to act consistently with the objects of the trust, to consult with the traditional owners in a liaison committee, to determine the membership of, and maintain the register of the traditional owners, and to assist the manager to gain experience in management.
 However, no resolution was proposed calling upon the directors of the trustee to resign, nor calling for the removal of the first applicant as trustee, nor supporting the winding-up of the first applicant. 16 By letter dated 21 November 2006, the trustee raised with the manager its concerns about various issues in connection with the manager's performance of its duties under the trust deed.
 The concerns related to the manner in which financial controls were exercised, and to the lack of proposals for projects being put forward by the manager. 17 Mr Softly says he obtained legal advice in November 2006 on how to remove the directors of the first applicant, or the first applicant as trustee. 18 The annual general meeting of the beneficiaries of the trust was held on 16 December 2006.
