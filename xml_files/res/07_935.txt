 The power of the creditors at the meeting to adjourn the meeting for a limited period (s 439B) to some extent alleviates the problem but in complex matters the period in question (not more than 60 days) is often not sufficient to meet the exigencies of the situation. 2 These applications are of particular difficulty because the administrations involve the development of a number of properties at different stages of development making any assessment of overall value extraordinarily difficult.
 Having considered the evidence in this case, I think that it is too early to commit to such a lengthy period before the creditors have any real say in the matter. 4 A course which is taken in some of these matters and was, I notice, taken in Fincorp [2007] NSWSC 363 , is to provide for a lengthy period but also, by an order under s 447A , permit foreshortening of the period if events warrant it.
