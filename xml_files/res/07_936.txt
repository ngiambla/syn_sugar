 I presume that this view of the respondent was not based on the DD Act , which as I have noted does not differentiate in substance between different types of assistance animals. 79 Fourth, the respondent in its policies reserved its rights to admit or deny access to animals which are pets or other animals in respect of therapy, and to exercise a discretion as to whether such animals should be admitted.
 It is no answer to say that it would have allowed the applicant access either without his dogs - which is implied by the respondent's submission that it refused the applicant access while accompanied by his dogs - or with dogs which it considered to be well-behaved, well-controlled and trained to a proper assistance dog standard.
 Subparagraphs (1)(a) to (c) relate specifically to access to, or the use of, any premises that the public or a section of the public is entitled or allowed to enter or use, and subpara (c) is more specific again in that it applies to discrimination in relation to the means of access to such premises.
 Although the respondent ultimately refused to allow the applicant access to its premises with his dogs so as to enliven s 23(1)(a) , in my view s 23(1)(b) is also relevant because in discriminating against the applicant, the respondent had imposed terms or conditions upon which it was prepared to allow the applicant access to its premises.
