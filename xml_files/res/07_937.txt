 The purpose is to quarantine each statutory fund from the general liabilities of the company and from the liabilities of other statutory funds. 2 In the present case, Metlife operates three statutory funds, with all of its investment and annuity policies issued from Funds No. 2 and No. 3.
 Assets referable to Metlife's No. 2 and No. 3 Funds with a value assessed as equal to the Metlife policy liabilities will be transferred to, and become part of, Challenger's No. 2 Fund.
 Each application proceeds upon the footing that every owner of a policy referable to Metlife Funds No. 2 and No. 3 and Challenger Fund No. 2 is "affected" within the meaning of s 191(2)(c).
 It could be contended that only those holders of Metlife policies which are actually transferred are "affected" and that the mere fact that a policy is referable to a statutory fund, which either has funds out of which or into which other policy liabilities are transferred, cannot be so categorised.
