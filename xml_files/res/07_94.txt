 He claims to be entitled to the orders sought as Managing Trustee of the Andrew Garrett Group of Family Trusts. 7 As I explained to Mr Garrett during his submissions this morning, this Court of course could not set aside a judgment made in the District Court of South Australia.
 Mr Garrett agreed that, in those circumstances, I could not make an order setting aside the sequestration order, however, he pursued the order sought in paragraph (1) that I should stay the sequestration order made on 24 September 2004 until such time as the matter is heard in the District Court of South Australia. 9 In my opinion, no order for a stay ought to be made.
