 On 31 January 2007, Branson J made the search and seizure orders and they were executed against the respondents to the Impact proceeding on 1 February 2007. 13 The statement of claim in the Impact proceeding alleges copyright infringement, trademark infringement and trade practices contraventions by the respondents, but the particulars are stated in somewhat general terms in Schedule 3.
 As in the Global proceeding matter, the statement of claim in the Impact proceeding reserved to Aristocrat the right to provide further particulars after discovery and interlocutory procedures. 14 At the first directions hearing in the Impact proceeding, I took the view that without ruling that the two sets of proceedings were related it was appropriate that they be case managed together.
