 The addition of the joint trustee to the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3 had the inevitable consequence of causing the matter to be adjourned to enable Mr Nicolazzo to be joined as a party and to afford the cross-claimants an opportunity to re-amend their statement of claim.
 If executed, the effect of the assignment of debt was to effectively replace an asset of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3 with a chose in action. 8 I adjourned the matter to enable Mr Varveghy, Mr Alcides and Mr Nicolazzo to be joined as parties.
 The trustees of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust (No 1) and the Andrew Garrett Family Trust (No 2) and the Andrew Garrett Family Trust (No 3), are restrained from disposing of, or dealing in any way with any of the assets of those trusts. 4.
