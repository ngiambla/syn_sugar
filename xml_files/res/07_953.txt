 As to the period after 17 June 2004, there was neither infringing two-dimensional nor three-dimensional reproduction in respect of those three drawings. 36 As to the one remaining drawing, BC 41 D015 (the pivot mechanism drawing), the Court found two and three-dimensional reproduction which was not the subject of protection by operation of s 77(2) in either its original or amended form and awarded damages in respect of that infringement.
 First, the applicant shall pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to all issues in connection with the contentions of direct or indirect infringement by the respondent of the 17 plans pleaded by the applicant's Statement of Claim of 18 March 2005, and abandoned by the Further Amended Statement of Claim of 7 March 2006, the subject of leave granted on 8 March 2006 for the plain enough reason that the applicant put the respondent to cost on those abandoned issues. 45 As to the costs of and in the cause generally, the applicant failed entirely in respect of 2 of the 7 plans; succeeded in respect of 3 of the 7 plans as to two-dimensional reproduction in the period from the crystallisation of the cause of action to 17 June 2004, although losses which might otherwise have been characterised as damages were considered to be referable to three-dimensional reproduction and sale within the scope of s 77(2) of the Copyright Act ; failed to establish infringing three-dimensional reproduction in respect of those three plans; failed to establish subsistence of copyright in respect of another drawing; and succeeded both as to two-dimensional and three-dimensional reproduction in respect of the pivot mechanism drawing.
 In dealing with the costs of the cause, I disregard the consideration that the applicant abandoned 17 of the initial 19 plans in suit, as costs in connection with that circumstance have been dealt with separately. 47 The exercise of the discretion in determining whether a party ought to pay the costs incurred by another in connection with a proceeding is not to be determined upon a shorthand statement of principle that costs simply follow the event.
