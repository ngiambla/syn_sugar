 As I currently understand the position from the pleadings, submissions and other material before me, this technology worked like an electronic funds transfer point of sale, or EFTPOS, terminal. 6 During 1996 the bank and Akyman were trialling these terminals or versions of them with the Australian Jockey Club and the Sydney Turf Club in a business relationship between those four organisations.
 They alleged that, first, on 11 March 1999 the bank proposed to ASS and Akyman that sales of the EFTPOS product cease until such time as particular identified problems with it were rectified, and, secondly, on 15 March 1999 Akyman responded by telling the bank that its proposal would be addressed by an upgrade to the third release of the product.
