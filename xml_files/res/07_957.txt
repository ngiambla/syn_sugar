 The question was whether the term of the Training Bond, by which Mr Clarke agreed to pay $7,500 to REX if he left REX's employment within a specified time, was a matter pertaining to the relationship between REX and the pilots that the Certified Agreement dealt with and if so, whether that term effectively altered or varied the rights and obligations concerning that matter or those matters in the Certified Agreement to the disadvantage of Mr Clarke?
 If the answer is yes, then consistent with the decision of the Full Court in McLennan it was not open to REX to seek to recover $7,500 from Mr Clarke because "... [b]y clear implication, the [Workplace Relations] Act prohibits the alteration of such rights or obligations which might disadvantage the employee by means other than those provided in the Act and renders ineffectual any agreement which purports to do so" : McLennan at [48]. 48 Mr Clarke submitted that the term of the Training Bond by which Mr Clarke agreed to pay $7,500 to REX if he left REX's employment within a specified time was referable to two matters pertaining to the relationship between REX and the pilots covered by the Certified Agreement --- training and termination.
 On 11 August 2005, the High Court refused Special Leave to appeal on the basis that (without endorsing all of the reasoning of the Full Court) the conclusion reached by the Full Court was correct: Surveillance Australia Pty Ltd v McLennan [2005] HCATrans 603 (11 August 2005). 53 REX also submitted that the decision in McLennan was distinguishable because it dealt with a different statutory instrument and because there were some factual differences.
