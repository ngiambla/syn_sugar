 If the party states that he has no information capable of leading to the formation of a belief in circumstances where he has information but does not accept it, then he must state the reasons why he is unable to form a belief or has not formed a belief. 10 Corporate parties such as the respondent in this case are required to verify answers to interrogatories through the mouth of the person with the most proximate knowledge of the facts and matters upon which interrogation is made.
 It is impermissible that those sub-questions be allowed. 14 As to the remaining interrogatories, identified as 1(i) and 1(ii) and 2(i) and 2(ii), they are in my opinion proper interrogatories to be administered in the circumstances of this case. 15 Whilst on the last occasion the respondent urged the view that it was not a party that could be burdened with an obligation to answer interrogatories in matters of this nature, that argument is no longer pressed and plainly rightly so.
