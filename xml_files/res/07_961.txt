 (Application for letter of request) 1 Section 581 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) provides in subs (4) that the Court may request a court of a country other than Australia that has jurisdiction in external administration matters, to act in aid of, and be auxiliary to, it (the Court) in an external administration matter.
 This section is similar to s 596B of the Act which permits this Court to summon a person for examination about a corporation's "examinable affairs" if the Court is satisfied that the person has taken part or been concerned in examinable affairs of the corporation and has been or may have been, guilty of misconduct in relation to the corporation, or may be able to give information about "examinable affairs" of the corporation.
