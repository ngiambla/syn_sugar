 In its statement of claim David Jones claims that the Institute and Dr Hamilton issued a further media release ('the further media release') in which they refused to withdraw any association between David Jones and the Discussion Paper or the media release (para 14) and in so doing repeated the conduct constituted by the issue of the media release and the conduct constituted by the making of the representations in the media release (para 15).
 In other words, the separate question is sought to be dealt with in a vacuum so far as the representations are concerned, and David Jones submits that is inappropriate. (10) Second, the order sought on the motion is that the question, to be decided separately from and in advance of the hearing of the other issues in the proceedings, is whether the conduct of the first respondent in making the media releases complained of was conduct in trade or commerce.
 In my view, it is far from clear that there will not be an overlap of issues and witnesses as between the threshold issue sought to be separated --- whether the conduct of the respondents in making the media releases or any representation that may be conveyed by either release is conduct in trade or commerce --- and what has been described as the merits issue --- whether such conduct was misleading or deceptive and/or be likely to mislead and/or deceive in contravention of s 52 of the TPA.
