 The background to the relief sought is set out in the statement of claim and may be relevantly summarised as follows: On 9 October 2006 the Institute issued a media release entitled 'Corporate paedophilia --- Sexualising children by advertising and marketing' ('the media release') announcing the launch of a discussion paper entitled 'Corporate Paedophilia --- Sexualisation of children in Australia' ('the Discussion Paper'), which the Institute caused to be prepared.
 David Jones claims that in the media release the respondents made the following representations: (a) David Jones eroticises children in order to obtain profits; (b) David Jones is responsible for advertising which portrays children in an exploitative way; (c) David Jones acts without conscience in sexually exploiting children for profit; (d) David Jones knowingly causes the publication of material which can be used by paedophiles for their sexual gratification; (e) the Discussion Paper contains conclusions to the effect of each of (a) to (d) above; (f) the Discussion Paper contains academic research and analysis which support each of the conclusions referred to in each of (a) to (d) above (para 10).
 In its statement of claim David Jones claims that the Institute and Dr Hamilton issued a further media release ('the further media release') in which they refused to withdraw any association between David Jones and the Discussion Paper or the media release (para 14) and in so doing repeated the conduct constituted by the issue of the media release and the conduct constituted by the making of the representations in the media release (para 15).
