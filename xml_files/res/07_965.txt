 Notwithstanding that, and at my request, the Australian Government Solicitor has taken some trouble in this matter to assist Mr Cram in seeking to recover from the Tribunal the documents which he believes ought to have been returned to him and has attended before this Court on at least three occasions.
 The motion is listed for hearing today. 4 Mr Cram has today objected to my sitting and has suggested that his application should be heard by the Full Court because of the position of Downes J who both holds a commission on this Court and is the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
 As no decision of Downes J is the subject matter of the application, I do not accept that the Court is not properly constituted to exercise the original jurisdiction of the Court. 5 Mr Cram has also sought to file in Court a notice of objection to competency, in which objection is taken to my personal competency, and a notice of appeal against decisions made by me.
