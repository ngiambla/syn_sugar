 That the Applicants' Proof of Debt dated 30 November 2006 is accepted in the sum of $128,608.21. ' By the time the application came on for hearing, the lastmentioned sum had been reduced to $119,646.44.
 Implicit in this is that following completion of the contract, the bankrupt's possession of the property was as a licensee, and not as a tenant, and that that situation continued up until the date of his bankruptcy.
 THE TRUSTEE'S POSITION On the hearing of the application, the trustee's position was that, following completion of the contract, the bankrupt's possession of the property was as a tenant, and not as a licensee, and that while the bankrupt had not vacated the property as at the date of bankruptcy, in the sense of removing all his chattels from the property, there was no entitlement in the applicants to 'rent' beyond the date of the fire; any further claim for 'rent' beyond the date of the fire was limited to a claim in damages, if any, for loss of income arising out of the substantial destruction of the improvements erected on the property.
 On the other hand, if the bankrupt's possession of the property beyond completion of the contract was as a licensee, the trustee on the hearing of the application, if not before, conceded that the applicants' entitlement to prove in the estate of the bankrupt was in the sum contended for by the applicants, namely, $119,646.44.
