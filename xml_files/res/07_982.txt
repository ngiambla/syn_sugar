 Ms Watson said that in 2000, she and Ms Murray met with Ms Smales and another director of the respondent and agreed to create a series of student workbooks to be used in teaching a phonemic approach. 24 Ms Watson went on to say that, while conducting workshops promoting the Sound Waves resources, she received requests from teachers for a wall chart to complement the student activity books.
 She said that it was as a result of those requests that she and Ms Murray decided to develop charts which were suitable for a wall chart and could also be reproduced in the student activity books. 25 Ms Watson also said that she was involved in the design of the Sound Waves Charts.
 A prototype of that chart was then developed and refined with various style changes, and many test colours were trialled. 26 Ms Watson deposed that she did not copy the THRASS Picturechart or any part of it in developing the Sound Waves resources nor the Sound Waves Charts.
