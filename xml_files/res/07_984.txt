 If the review indicates that the concerns remain, the Case Management Committee may forward the matter to the Medical Director for consideration of referral to Professional Services Review. ' 25 I interpolate that I reject the submission of Dr Carrick that the Chairman thereby advised Dr Carrick that any subsequent review of her practice profile would relate only to services provided by her after June 2001.
 A review necessarily concerns a practice profile for a period terminating before the date of that review. 26 On 8 April 2001 Dr Carrick wrote to the Chairman indicating that she was happy to adjust her medical practice to meet his requirements and confirming that she had sought advice from him and from Dr Lorenz as to how best to achieve that outcome.
 Section 93(6) of the Act provides that where the Director makes an adjudicative referral the Director must prepare and attach to the adjudicative referral: 'a written report to the Committee, in respect of the services to which the referral relates, giving the reasons why the Director thinks that conduct by the person under review in connection with rendering or initiating the services may have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice' .
