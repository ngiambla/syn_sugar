 Section 95(2) ensures that the members of a Professional Services Review Committee are practitioners who belong to the profession in which the practitioner was practising when he or she rendered or initiated the referred services. 11 The statutory process of investigation for which Part VAA of the Act provides is initiated by an investigative referral made by the Commission to the Director (s 86).
 Section 93(6) of the Act provides that where the Director makes an adjudicative referral the Director must prepare and attach to the adjudicative referral: 'a written report to the Committee, in respect of the services to which the referral relates, giving the reasons why the Director thinks that conduct by the person under review in connection with rendering or initiating the services may have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice' .
 This statutory requirement suggests against any legislative intention that the conclusions arrived at by the Committee are to be arrived at by reference to evidence independent of that considered by the Director. 83 It is also significant in this regard that the Director is not authorised to make a finding that a person has engaged in inappropriate practice.
