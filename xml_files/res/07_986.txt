 The properties that the equity purchase and payment is made for in this agreement are: a) 5/3 Alfriston, Elwood Vic 3184 b) 10 Claremont, St South Yarra Vic 3141 c) 18 St Kilda Road, St Kilda Vic 3182 4.
 Mr Vasiliou said that, in compliance with its agreement with him on 25 March 1989, Optquest paid the amount of each drawdown to him, and that he used what was required to pay each instalment to the Deputy Commissioner.
 It follows that equity will not recognise the gift as complete and that, subject only to the transaction of March 1989 to which I shall refer presently, Mr Vasiliou held the full beneficial title to the subject properties at all times.
 It is clear from that statement and from the other evidence referred to above that, if Mr Vasiliou was obliged to pay the Deputy Commissioner a sum even approaching that claimed, the subject properties would have been lost.
 They submitted that Optquest had not paid the $182,000 required by the agreement, and had not paid the rates and outgoings as required by cl 9 thereof. 106 In his affidavit of 24 March 2006, Mr Vasiliou said that the full amount of $182,000 had been paid to him by Optquest by June 1989.
 I so conclude because of the unpaid rates and outgoings, and regardless of whether there was a readiness and willingness to make good the shortfall in the payment of the $182,000 to Mr Vasiliou. 118 It is not easy to identify any further basis for the proposition that Optquest derived an equitable interest in the subject properties as a result of the agreement of March 1989.
 In the circumstances, by the time Mr Vasiliou and Optquest made their agreement on 25 March 1989, Mr Vasiliou no longer faced the prospect of a claim for income tax of the order which had confronted him in September 1987.
 The respondents said nothing about the future course of the Deputy Commissioner's proceeding, or about whether it ultimately became necessary for Mr Vasiliou to find further funds in order to settle the proceeding, or to satisfy any judgment.
 Although Mr Vasiliou was able to raise (via Optquest) about $175,000 --- more than enough to settle the Deputy Commissioner's income tax claims --- raising another $160,000.00 or thereabouts would, I consider, have been a different matter altogether.
 Mr Vasiliou is entitled to be indemnified by the trust for the outlay in each case. 137 Secondly, there is a claim by Bendigo Bank Ltd which the applicant accepts bears no relation to the subject properties.
