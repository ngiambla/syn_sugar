 It is clear from that statement and from the other evidence referred to above that, if Mr Vasiliou was obliged to pay the Deputy Commissioner a sum even approaching that claimed, the subject properties would have been lost.
 These circumstances make it difficult for the applicant to succeed on his submission that, in October 1987 or thereabouts, Mr Vasiliou would have been unable to raise the sum of about $160,000.00 if he had had to do so.
 In the circumstances, by the time Mr Vasiliou and Optquest made their agreement on 25 March 1989, Mr Vasiliou no longer faced the prospect of a claim for income tax of the order which had confronted him in September 1987.
 The respondents said nothing about the future course of the Deputy Commissioner's proceeding, or about whether it ultimately became necessary for Mr Vasiliou to find further funds in order to settle the proceeding, or to satisfy any judgment.
