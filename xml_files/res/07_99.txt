 I see no real difficulty in excusing him this oversight, particularly as there can be no question of any real prejudice arising to the respondent. 5 Ms Dinnen who appeared for the respondent before me today, however, in opposing the application for extension of time, drew my attention to a judgment of Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344.
 The questions of law said to be raised by the appeal include the proper application of principles stated by this Court in two decisions, Hart v Comcare [2005] FCAFC 16 ; (2005) 145 FCR 29 and Comcare v Mooi (1996) 69 FCR 439.
 I accept that there is a lack of precision about the issues which are said to arise from a consideration of these two cases and that is a matter to which attention should be given by the applicant and his legal advisers before the matter proceeds much further. 7 Those two cases proceed upon different lines of reasoning.
 In the circumstances I am not prepared to conclude that there is not a question of law which might not arise from a consideration of the application of those cases to Mr Lever's circumstances as addressed by the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 8 Should it become clear that in fact the appeal which he desires to bring raises no question of law for consideration by this Court, then that is a matter which can be dealt with in connection with the hearing of the appeal, whether by motion challenging the competency of the appeal or at the hearing of the appeal itself. 9 In the circumstances I am satisfied that it is proper to grant an extension of time in which to appeal and I so order.
