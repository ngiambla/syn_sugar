 1 This proceeding came before me as an application for leave to appeal from a decision of a judge of the Court on appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal'): Druett v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2007] FCA 475.
 The decision of the Tribunal 7 In the decision the subject of this appeal, the Tribunal noted that no respondent had been identified and that Mr Druett was the only party to appear ( Druett and No Respondent [2006] AATA 1043).
 No such order for costs could be made by the Tribunal. 20 Mr Druett was unable to point to any specific error in the conclusions of the Tribunal or the primary judge.
 His chief complaint, as outlined in his written submissions, is that ' the State of New South Wales and Departments of Family and Community Services ' removed his children for improper purposes and in circumstances that were unjust and unconscionable.
