 A copy of this document has been provided to the Court and I am willing to treat it as though it were a filed pleading. 7 On 24 May 2007, Madgwick J, on the basis of certain undertakings given by Paul James Simpson, a director of Socasen, and his wife, Deidre Simpson, restrained Caltex until 30 June 2007, or further order, from taking further action consequential on the termination notice.
 The parties accept that the relief granted by his Honour was in the nature of interim relief and that it is necessary for Socasen to demonstrate, according to the usual principles, an entitlement to interlocutory relief beyond that date. 8 On 26 June 2007 I heard Socasen's application for, as I understand it, an order restraining Caltex from taking possession of the North Richmond site in reliance on the notice of termination until the delivery of final judgment in this proceeding or its earlier termination.
 Socasen claims damages from Caltex for breach of contract and pursuant to the TPA in respect of its loss and expenses arising from the allegedly defective computer system. 13 Socasen also claims that Caltex has engaged in unconscionable conduct in respect of the making of what are known as REM payments.
 BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 38 In having regard to the balance of convenience I must give consideration to the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought. 39 On the evidence before me it seems that the practical consequences are likely to include that, at least until the hearing and determination of this proceeding, Socasen will continue to operate an unprofitable business.
