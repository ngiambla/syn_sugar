 The most recent of these applications was determined by Flick J on 13 December 2007, in which his Honour declined to expedite the hearing of an appeal from the decision of a Judge of the Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission: see Rivera v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 2037.
 Similarly, these reasons do not stay the surrender warrant issued under s 23 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth). 6 O 80 r 4(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) provides: 'The Court or a Judge may , if it is in the interests of the administration of justice , refer a litigant to the Registrar for referral to a legal practitioner on the Pro Bono Panel for legal assistance in relation to a proceeding before the Court. ' (Emphasis added. ) When considering such an application, O 80 r 4(2) empowers the Court to take into account any matter it deems appropriate, including the means of the litigant, the capacity of the litigant to otherwise obtain legal assistance and the nature and complexity of the proceeding.
 The Great Writ was not designed to aid the evasion of justice, but rather the proper administration of it, a task that would be impossible if properly issued extradition warrants were frustrated by specious applications in circumstances such as those of the present case. 13 Mr Rivera's application of 28 December 2007 also indicates that he will argue that, pursuant to s 26(5) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth), he is retained in custody unlawfully because two months have elapsed since the day on which the surrender warrant in respect of his extradition was first liable to be executed.
