 On 2 January 2008 however, the applicant filed a notice of motion seeking to have the hearing expedited and the surrender warrant issued under s 23 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) stayed, in light of an arrangement that he be extradited from Australia to the United States some time in the week commencing 7 January 2008.
 This arrangement was put in place after the applicant was placed on a commercial airline flight to the United States on 22 December 2007 in the custody of United States authorities, but, due to the pilot's refusal to carry him, was removed from the aircraft prior to its departure and returned to the custody of Australian authorities. 3 When the notice of motion came on for hearing before Tamberlin J on 3 January 2008, the applicant stated that he did not wish to press at that time either his application of 28 December 2007 or his notice of motion of 2 January 2008, despite the fact that he was well aware of the arrangement to remove him from Australia during the week commencing 7 January 2008.
 It may be that detention of the applicant in lawful custody by Australian authorities would not terminate until he was transported 'out of Australia to a place in the United States' (para (c) of the s 23 surrender warrant) a view to which his Honour, Tamberlin J, inclined, but it is not necessary that I come to any conclusion on that view.
 On my view, the authority of the s 23 surrender warrant did not cease because the applicant was not transported out of Australia; his re-transfer into the custody of Australian authorities on 22 December 2007 and his continued custody by them since that date is therefore lawful. 8 The second argument is equally unsustainable.
