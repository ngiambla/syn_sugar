 (Revised from Transcript) 1 In this matter reasons for decision were published on 20 June 2008 ( E J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan [2008] FCA 934) and the matter was stood over to this morning for the purpose of making final orders disposing of the proceeding. 2 There is agreement as to the form of the orders to be made with one exception.
 That exception is whether an order for the removal of the Gallo Winery trademark should be made as from today's date (and that order stayed for 21 days) or whether the order for removal should take effect retrospectively as from 8 May 2007.
 No Australian decision has apparently addressed the question now posed by the competing submissions of Lion Nathan and Gallo Winery . 4 It is considered that that discretionary power can only be exercised as from the date upon which a court makes an order for the removal of a mark from the Register and does not confer a power to order removal from a date prior to judgment.
