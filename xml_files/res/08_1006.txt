 There is therefore no statutory authority to authorise the making of the examination order in this case. (emphasis added) 18 There can be, with respect, no doubt as to the correctness of the observations as to sovereignty and they have been adopted on a number of occasions in other contexts (eg Caterpillar Inc v John Deere Limited (No 2) [2000] FCA 1903 ; Tycoon Holdings Pty Ltd and Kangarilla Pty Ltd v Trencor Jetco Inc and Mole Engineering Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 380 per Lee J; The News Corporation Ltd v Fenfest Communications Inc [1996] NSWSC 474 per Giles J).
 That jurisdictional point may have only fallen for consideration in Re Deposit because his Honour followed the decision of McLelland J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to conclude that an examination summons was not an originating process. 20 Senior counsel observes that the jurisdictional consideration was not evaluated in Fiorentino 79 FCR 327 or in the other decisions which have followed Fiorentino .
 In this instance, the decision has already been made and acted upon. 25 My view is that the appropriate course for the examinee, given that the decision has already been made and acted upon, is to apply for leave to appeal from that decision if the examinee wishes to press the Full Court to set aside the order permitting leave to serve the examination summons outside of Australia.
