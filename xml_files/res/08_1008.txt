 The respondent's notice of motion dated 26 April 2007 be adjourned to 9.30am on 4 September 2007. 3 On 16 August 2007 the parties, by agreement, consented to an extension of time within which the applicant had to lodge its proposed fourth amended statement of claim, from 9 August 2007 to 27 August 2007.
 The hearing of the application was adjourned again by consent to 20 September 2007. 4 On 19 September 2007 the applicant filed a notice of motion seeking an adjournment of the hearing of the notice of motion filed on 12 June 2007 to amend the applicant's third further amended statement of claim. 5 On 20 September 2007 I dismissed the applicant's notice of motion of 12 June 2007 and made the following further relevant orders: 2.
 The respondents have leave to tax forthwith (and such costs, as agreed or taxed to be paid forthwith): 5.1 the costs the subject of paragraph 3, save for the costs the subject of paragraphs 3.7 and 3.8; 5.2 the costs the subject of paragraph 2 of the orders of Lander J on 20 September 2007; 5.3 the costs the subject of paragraph 6 of the orders of Lander J on 27 November 2007; and 5.4 the costs the subject of paragraph 4. 6.
 They will recover those costs in due course whatever the result of the principal proceeding. 42 The applicant's case against the respondents arises out of transactions entered into between the applicant and the respondents which, the applicant claims, gives rise to a very significant claim for damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
