 He said that he raised questions of site allowance, long service leave, contributions to the Construction Industry Long Service Leave fund, redundancy contributions to the Building Industry Redundancy Scheme Trust, superannuation contributions and WorkCover contributions with Mr Zito.
 He did so intentionally. 89 In my opinion, the applicant has established that during the period between 8.15 am and 10.00 am on 5 May 2004, the respondent hindered or obstructed Mr Potter carrying out his duties to coordinate the concrete pour.
 He also hindered or obstructed Mr Zito and his employees from carrying out their work by delaying trucks entering the Halifax Street site. 90 I find therefore the applicant has established that the respondent contravened s 285E(1) of the Act.
