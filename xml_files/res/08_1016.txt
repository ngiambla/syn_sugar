 He said that Mr Athanasas might, because of his condition, consent to something that he would not intentionally mean to consent to without thinking of the consequences. 25 The transcript shows: It's not a question of agreeing.
 I am prepared to accept that Mr Athanasas has found these proceedings stressful and no doubt he feels challenged by the procedure and, in particular, by his obligation to produce documents to the Court.
 There are other documents about which Mr Athanasas gave evidence in his examination on 5 February 2008 which were in South Australia in the control of a Mr Vellacchio and which also have not been produced.
 The said Peter Athanasas has failed to comply with his statutory obligations under sections 81 and 264C (1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) to produce documents pursuant to the summons issued by this Court on 5 July 2007. 43 On 30 May 2008 I drew to Mr Athanasas' attention that the Registrar's notice of motion was due to be heard on 13 June 2008 and pointed out to him that it would be in his best interests if he produced any documents before that date.
