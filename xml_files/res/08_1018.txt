 The definition proposed by the applicants was that "'Infringing Articles' means the Hensley System, the PAC Mining System, the CQMS System and the CQMS Lower Wing System (and any other wear assembly that contains the essential integers of claim 1 of Jones III). " The definition proposed by the respondents was that "'Infringing Articles' means the Hensley System, the PAC Mining System, the CQMS System and the CQMS Lower Wing System".
 The respondents also say that the breadth of this definition, and its usage in Order 1 proposed by the applicants, invites further litigation due to the uncertainty inherent within it. 5 I agree with the submissions of the respondents on this point.
 This proposed order, in effect, declares that the making, hiring, otherwise disposing etc. of the components of the "Infringing Articles" is an infringement of claim 1 of Jones III. 7 The respondents argue that there are a number of components contained within the "Infringing Articles" which are not essential parts in the sense that they can be used for other purposes.
 Accordingly, I shall make Order 1 proposed by the respondents, with the modification that the declaration shall encompass both the "Infringing Articles" and their component parts which have no reasonable use other than as component parts. 10 Another dispute concerns the language of Order 4 proposed by the applicants.
