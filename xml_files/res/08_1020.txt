 I discuss this issue in more detail at [60]ff below. 24 In breach of the Agreement, ResMed has not paid the University licence fees in respect of the sales of the Mirage Mask, in consequence of which the University has suffered and continues to suffer loss and damage ( 16 , 17 ).
 In particular, it need not have incorporated the use of the information and know-how "relating to" the invention (the Nasal Mask) that the University undertook by cl 3.2 to supply to ResMed. 55 The FASOC does not allege that the University supplied any information or know-how to ResMed in performance of its obligation under cl 3.2.
 It is conceivable, I suppose, that the University's case will be that ResMed acquired information and know-how that related to the Nasal Mask, whether forming part of the invention or not, otherwise than by being supplied with that information and know-how by the University pursuant to cl 3.2.
