 I have heard debate on the question whether I can make an order under s 1323 of the kind which ASIC seeks or directly under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) . 5 There is a question about whether or not an application for relief under s 1323 can be brought as an interlocutory process in a pending civil proceeding.
 I do not need to give a concluded opinion on that matter. 6 The argument put by ASIC in relation to the s 1323 element of its application was that I should make an order under s 23 as an incident of my power to make an order under s 1323.
