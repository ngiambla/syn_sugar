 I have heard debate on the question whether I can make an order under s 1323 of the kind which ASIC seeks or directly under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) . 5 There is a question about whether or not an application for relief under s 1323 can be brought as an interlocutory process in a pending civil proceeding.
 I do not need to give a concluded opinion on that matter. 6 The argument put by ASIC in relation to the s 1323 element of its application was that I should make an order under s 23 as an incident of my power to make an order under s 1323.
 This would be on the basis that I was satisfied that receivers could be appointed under s 1323 and could then resort to s 23 as a fallback position: see Australian Securities Investments Commission; In the Matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd ACN 099 071 968 v Carey (No 14) [2007] FCA 310.
 I will add to para 1, after the words, "all or any of his assets whether within or outside Australia whether held legally or beneficially by him" these words, "nor do any act by way of instruction, advice or expression of wishes to any company or third party which has the purpose or is likely to have the effect of reducing the value of any asset owned by him or under his control. " Subject to that change and the deletion of the travel restraint, which is not in dispute, and other minor variations, I will make the orders sought.
