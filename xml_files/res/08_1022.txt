 An order that, until further order of the court, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service be restrained until further order from releasing goods referred to in a particular paragraph in the substantive application which goods are referred to in a notice of seizure to objector, there is then a date in respect of the notice of seizure which is 20 April 2008, in each case. 3.
 It suffices to note that the extension that was at least purportedly granted in each instance by the Chief Executive Officer of Customs was not granted within the period of 10 working days from 28 April 2008. 9 The effect of the Act is that in the ascertainment of what amounts to a working day one looks to days which are working days in the Australian Capital Territory.
 It also favours the granting of the interlocutory relief which is sought against each of the Respondents, Bowman and MacKinnon. 28 Thus, while there is no occasion for the exercise of the power conferred by s 137(5) of the Act , there is occasion, nonetheless, for the exercise of more generally conferred power to keep the goods in the Customs zone and I do propose to make an order directed to the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to achieve that end.
