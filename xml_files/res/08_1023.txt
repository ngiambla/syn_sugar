 The references to investigation, prosecution and punishment in the definition make it clear that the relevant perspective is that of the administrators of the criminal justice system, not that of a person who may be suspected of having committed a criminal offence, or who is being or has been prosecuted for an offence, or who has been or may be punished by way of imprisonment for the commission of an offence.
 Indeed, the bare expression "administration of criminal justice", even independently of the definition, would, to my mind, indicate the perspective mentioned. 10 The views expressed above are supported by the scheme of the provisions in Div 4. 11 Subdivision B of Div 4 provides for the issue of criminal justice entry certificates and Subdiv C provides for the issue of criminal justice stay certificates, or, of present relevance, criminal justice stay warrants. 12 Subdivision C is concerned with unlawful non-citizens who are to be or who are likely to be removed or deported.
 The reference to a "court" in that section has an ambulatory operation and refers to any court otherwise seized of power to issue a warrant to stay a removal or deportation for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in the particular jurisdiction, Commonwealth or State as the case may be. 17 The picture that emerges from the above provisions is that they are concerned with investigation, enforcement and punishment within the criminal justice system of the Commonwealth or of a State respectively.
