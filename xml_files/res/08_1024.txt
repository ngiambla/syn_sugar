 The effect of this finding is that, pursuant to s 24(2)(a) of the VE Act, Mr Cadd is deemed not to satisfy the second limb of s 24(1)(c), that is he shall not be taken to be "suffering a loss of salary or wages, or of earnings on his or her own account" by reason of his incapacity from accepted disabilities. ... [C]onsequently Mr Cadd does not qualify for payment of pension at the special rate.
 Put shortly, the applicant's contention is that the Tribunal misapplied the law by focussing on why Mr Cadd ceased a particular job and not upon why, if it was the case, he ceased to be engaged in remunerative employment.
 An indication of that focus and error, it is said, is the apparent significance the Tribunal attributed to Mr Cadd's 2005 view with hindsight that he had been unfit for any employment since his resignation. 14 The respondent's case is that the applicant has mischaracterised the Tribunal's reasoning and that, fairly considered, that reasoning reveals that the Tribunal asked and answered the correct question, ie whether a state of affairs had been reached such that it could properly be said that Cadd was no longer engaged in remunerative work.
