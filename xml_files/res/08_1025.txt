 In that case at p 64 Knox CJ took the view that it followed from the opinions expressed in Minehan that: ... a person who has originally entered Australia as an immigrant may in course of time and by force of circumstances cease to be an immigrant, and become a member of the Australian community.
 The special provisions made by the PNG Constitution concerning persons under the age of 19 years, which explain reg 2 of the Papua New Guinea Independence (Australian Citizenship of Young Persons) Regulations (Cth), may for present purposes be ignored because Mr Charlie did not at any time renounce his purported Australian citizenship (see s 64(2) of the PNG Constitution ). 42 It is accepted that Mr Charlie was born in Papua before Independence Day and has two grand-parents who were born in Papua.
 Section 65(1) of the PNG Constitution would thus have rendered him a citizen of Papua New Guinea as at Independence Day unless he had "a right (whether revocable or not) to permanent resident in Australia" (see s 65(4)). 43 For the purposes of the PNG Constitution a person who had "a right (whether revocable or not) to permanent residence in Australia" was a person who had "real foreign citizenship" within the meaning of s 64.
