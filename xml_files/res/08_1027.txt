 1 The applicant, Primus Telecommunications Pty Ltd, has applied to the Court for damages from Kooee Communications Pty Ltd in respect of what Primus alleges was misleading or deceptive conduct engaged in by Kooee, in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
 Primus also alleges that Kooee made a false representation to it and breached an implied duty to act in good faith in relation to the performance of a contract between Primus and Kooee. 2 Primus filed its application in the Victoria District Registry of the Court on 21 December 2007.
 Primus contends that a ruling to that effect would not lead to a judgment inconsistent with that in New South Wales which concerned an examination of entitlements under the Separation Deed itself and not any claims based on a statutory remedy or allied contractual claims.
