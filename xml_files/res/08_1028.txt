 Rather than the Full Court considering any order which did not truly reflect the intention of the Court, the opportunity was extended to the parties to have the form of the orders previously made further considered (if that was considered appropriate).
 The reasons for decision then given expressed reservation as to the utility of the Respondents' Notice of Motion being heard in advance of further amendments being made, as contemplated by the Applicants.
