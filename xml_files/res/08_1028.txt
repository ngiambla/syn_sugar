 Rather than the Full Court considering any order which did not truly reflect the intention of the Court, the opportunity was extended to the parties to have the form of the orders previously made further considered (if that was considered appropriate).
 The reasons for decision then given expressed reservation as to the utility of the Respondents' Notice of Motion being heard in advance of further amendments being made, as contemplated by the Applicants.
 The reservation expressed arose because the Applicants had not previously amended their pleadings and could do so unless the proceeding itself was dismissed: Federal Court Rules, O 13, r 3.
 That order reflected the intention of the Court and should thus not now be varied. 8 Orders 1 and 2 as made on 30 November 2008 should be varied so as to remove such ambiguity as may otherwise have arisen. 9 Insofar as the orders as made on 31 March 2008 are concerned, it was the intention of the Court to resolve " the proceedings generally ": [2008] FCA 430 at [8] .
