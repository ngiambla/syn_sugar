 On 26 May 2008 reasons were delivered in support of orders adjourning the plaintiff's application and dismissing the application by counsel for Mr Waller and Wainter for leave to be heard ( Freehills, in the matter of New Tel Limited (in liq) ACN 009 068 955 [2008] FCA 762). 4 On receipt of additional evidence, on 19 June 2008 I allowed the plaintiff's application.
 The question is whether in the circumstances raised by Mr Waller and Wainter, the plaintiff should be compensated by a costs order only in relation to that additional work over and above its ex parte application. 6 There is a discretion at large to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
