 On 26 May 2008 reasons were delivered in support of orders adjourning the plaintiff's application and dismissing the application by counsel for Mr Waller and Wainter for leave to be heard ( Freehills, in the matter of New Tel Limited (in liq) ACN 009 068 955 [2008] FCA 762). 4 On receipt of additional evidence, on 19 June 2008 I allowed the plaintiff's application.
 The question is whether in the circumstances raised by Mr Waller and Wainter, the plaintiff should be compensated by a costs order only in relation to that additional work over and above its ex parte application. 6 There is a discretion at large to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 Those special circumstances are said to include the fact that submissions made for Mr Waller and Wainter led to a conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the requirement of providing evidence as to the law of the foreign country. 9 It is true that I did not immediately grant the plaintiff's application to make an application for service out of the jurisdiction on 8 May 2008 but rather adjourned the application on the basis that additional evidence should be supplied.
 As I made clear in my reserved reasons at [24], the application raised some serious questions concerning service in a foreign jurisdiction. 11 Mr Waller and Wainter also contend that the other special circumstances which warrant a departure from the normal rule is that there was a failure to make full and fair disclosure on the part of the plaintiff.
