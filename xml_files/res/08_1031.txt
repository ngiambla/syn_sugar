 A more detailed examination of the Management Agreement shows that Enterprises Australia was given comprehensive control of the operation and management of the hotel. 8 The Management Agreement referred to Lilyvale as the "Owner" and Enterprises Australia as the "Operating Company".
 It recited the experience of Enterprises Australia "in planning, technical assistance, management and operation of international standard hotels in various countries ..." and stated that Lilyvale "desires to enter into this Agreement in order to entrust the operation and management" of the hotel to Enterprises Australia.
 The Management Agreement (with Enterprises Australia) and the Licence Agreement (with ANA Hotels) were terminated however, pursuant to a new Licence and Services Agreement with ANA Hotels, Lilyvale retained the right to use 'ANA Intellectual Property' for 12 months (including the trademarks, ANA Hotels and ANA Harbour Grand Hotel and the Unkai name).
