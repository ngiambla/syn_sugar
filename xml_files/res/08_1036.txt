 INTRODUCTION 1 I published Reasons for Judgment in four related proceedings on 24 April 2008: see Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 (the earlier reasons). 2 The earlier reasons left outstanding the question of all orders to be made, including orders as to costs. 3 On 9 July 2008, by consent as to form, I made orders disposing of one of the four proceedings, NSD 1870 of 2005 (the TGA (Protected Information) Proceeding). 4 The parties made written and oral submissions on the orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings: NSD 1120 of 2005 (the Revocation Proceeding) NSD 954 of 2006 (the Arrow Proceeding) NSD 1078 of 2006 (the Lundbeck Appeal (Extension of Term) Proceeding) 5 I made orders on 19 June 2008 in those proceedings.
 Moreover, there is some force in the submissions made by Alphapharm noted at [27] above, and by Arrow noted at [32] above. 40 Having regard to all of the considerations referred to, I think the appropriate order is that Lundbeck parties recover 40% of their costs, and that Alphapharm pay 30% and Arrow 10% of those costs in order to make up the 40%. (The Lundbeck parties did not press a submission they originally made that Alphapharm and Lundbeck should be jointly and severally liable, irrespective of their rights inter se .
