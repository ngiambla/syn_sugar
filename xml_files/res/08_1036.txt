 I was informed that if there is a stay, nonetheless the attention of those searching the Register will be drawn to the fact of the making of the Court's orders, the pending appeal and the stay of the orders in the light of the appeal. 14 If the particulars of the extension are removed, and the Court lacks power to order their reinstatement, Lundbeck would suffer a gross injustice if it succeeds in its appeal, whether or that success occurs before or after 13 June 2009.
 On the other hand, if the particulars of the extension remain registered and Lundbeck loses the appeal after 13 June 2009, Lundbeck will have the benefit of a de facto extension for a short while beyond that date. 15 From Alphapharm's viewpoint, Alphapharm would not enjoy the benefit of the removal of the particulars of the extension until after 13 June 2009.
 Alphapharm submits that like itself, Arrow is a generic company, and that the benefit of Alphapharm's labours (the removal of the extension of the term of the Patent) will enure to its benefit too. 30 The Lundbeck parties emphasise that Alphapharm and Arrow challenged the validity of its Patent, and that it succeeded on that issue except in a relatively minor respect (claim 5).
