 Therefore, it is said, a real controversy exists between the parties, the question is not merely hypothetical, and the Court has jurisdiction to make declaratory and restraining orders in his favour. 7 The Minister contends that the Court does not have jurisdiction in relation to the matter which Mr Asaad seeks to raise.
 It is submitted that the Minister's reliance on s 5E of the Act is misplaced because any challenge made to the correctness of an opinion prior to taking action (in this case, the removal of Mr Asaad from Australia) is merely part of the decision-maker's reasoning process, and thus cannot itself be a "decision" within the meaning of s 5E.
 The difficulty for the applicant in that case was that the jurisdictional error was not pleaded in the Statement of Claim because the case proceeded on the assumption that it was sufficient to allege that it was not reasonably practicable, as a matter of fact, to remove the applicant from Australia.
