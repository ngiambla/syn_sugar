 It is submitted that the Minister's reliance on s 5E of the Act is misplaced because any challenge made to the correctness of an opinion prior to taking action (in this case, the removal of Mr Asaad from Australia) is merely part of the decision-maker's reasoning process, and thus cannot itself be a "decision" within the meaning of s 5E.
