 1 Both the Applicant/Cross-Respondent, Fig Tree Developments Ltd ("Fig Tree"), and the Respondent/Cross-Claimant, Australian Property Custodian Holdings Ltd as responsible entity for the Prime Retirement and Aged Care Property Trust ("Prime"), in the substantive proceedings have brought what one might term practice and procedure applications relating to aspects of discovery and inspection.
 Order 2 of the Orders made 28 November 2007 (the Confidentiality Orders) be varied by deleting the words "(together, "the Confidential Documents")" and substituting with the following: "(together, "the Confidential Documents"), but the documents identified in Annexure A to this Order are not Confidential Documents. " 2.
 However, there is no such positive right in respect of portions of documents sought to be withheld from inspection on the grounds of confidentiality or irrelevance (Telstra Corporation v Australis Media Holdings (McLelland CJ in Eq, 10 February 1997, unreported)).
 I therefore propose to order that such of the masked documents as are subject to a claim for privilege be excluded from production, save for that Fig Tree must produce the documents which it has discovered in its lists.
