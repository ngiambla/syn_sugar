 His entitlement to receive the " exceptional circumstances relief payment " thus depended upon s 12(1) of the 1992 Act, which provides as follows: Multiple entitlement exclusion (1) Farm household support, exceptional circumstances relief payment or farm help income support is not payable to a person if the person is receiving a social security benefit, a social security pension or a service pension.
 And s 23(1) of the 1991 Act defines a " social security benefit " as including " newstart allowance ". 13 Section 12(1) thus provides that the " exceptional circumstances relief payment " sought by the Applicant was " not payable ".
 On 4 July 2007 the Social Security Appeals Tribunal affirmed the decision under review rejecting the claim for an " exceptional circumstances relief payment "; as did the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by its decision in November 2007. 15 The form of the Application as filed with this Court annexed a letter which provided in part as follows: I am understandably very upset by the situation I find myself in.
 In the present proceeding the Applicant explained to this Court that he was provided with a copy of the decision of the Tribunal in late January 2008 and thereafter he was given the " run around " when he attempted to get the " paperwork " necessary to be completed for the purposes of an appeal.
