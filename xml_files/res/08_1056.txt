 I should add as I have already found that Sirtex was not at any time on notice of a potential claim by UWA through any of its directors other than Dr Gray.
 The application of any cause of action based on knowing involvement in his alleged breaches of fiduciary duty would have depended entirely upon his role as a director of Sirtex and whether his knowledge could be attributed to the company. 15 On 8 May 2008, the time for filing an appeal from the primary judgment of 17 April 2008 expired.
 However there was no determination of those matters in the judgment. 24 Sirtex submitted that to the extent that it had incurred costs on and after the closure of its open offer on 19 March 2007 commensurately Dr Gray's exposure under the cross-claim had increased.
