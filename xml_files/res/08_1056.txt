 It is a condition precedent to settlement in accordance with this offer that Sirtex withdraws its opposition to the implementation of the settlement between the University and the Cancer Research Institute Inc, which was approved by the Federal Court of Australia on 9 March 2007. 7.
 This offer is an open offer and may be withdrawn at any time prior to acceptance by notice in writing served by the University upon Sirtex or its legal representatives in the proceedings.
 It referred, in particular, to paragraph 1569 and 1570 of the primary judgment in which it was said: The case against Sirtex for knowing involvement in Dr Gray's alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and knowing assistance depends crucially upon the primary case against Dr Gray.
