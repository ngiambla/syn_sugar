 Rather, I think it more reasonable in the circumstances to conclude that when s 92 was repealed Parliament did not insert a substitute for s 92(4) because the view was taken that s 35A covered the field. 12 The respondents' second proposition is built primarily on the fact (not in dispute) that when the Affair cigarettes were stolen they were "stale", in that they had passed their "use by" date.
 However, the argument overlooks certain important facts and ignores the structure of the Customs Act . 13 As regards the facts, the cigarettes themselves did have a value when they were imported --- they were not then stale.
 I am also prepared to accept for the sake of argument that: (1) even where a Collector is not required to request an accounting, he or she may nevertheless do so, particularly in a case such as this where the goods are not "readily saleable"; and (2) the Collector's discretion to then accept or reject the accounting is not completely unfettered. 20 Arguably, a voluntary request for an accounting was made in this case.
