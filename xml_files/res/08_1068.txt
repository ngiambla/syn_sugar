 The resignation of those two directors left Peter George and Nigel Purves as the continuing directors. 20 At the hearing on 13 June 2008, the defendant applied for an adjournment on the basis that a proposal was being formulated by a company called Inquisitor Pty Limited (Inquisitor) as trustee of the "Cooroy unit trust. " Inquisitor is associated with Mr Purves.
 It is to be noted that in accordance with its undertaking given to the Court on 13 June 2008, the defendant has not been meeting redemption requests since that date. 24 There is in evidence a document of the defendant listing "Debentures matured with redemption requests as at 25/06/2008. " Over several pages this document lists investors whose debentures had matured on dates ranging from 2 May 2008 to 25 June 2008.
 For example, in July 2008 $8,984,290.67 of debentures are due to mature and it is on the cards that 72% of this amount ($6,468,689.28) or more will be called for. 26 From July to September 2008 $38,290,692 of debentures are due to mature.
 If, say, 70% of that amount is called for, there would be an obligation to pay $26,803,484. 27 Unfortunately, I think the inferences to be drawn are that the defendant is trading at a loss and is insolvent, that the assets of the defendant and it subsidiaries represent the value of the debenture holders' security save to the extent that they or some of them form security in favour of third parties having priority, and that the defendant's liabilities are significantly greater than its assets. 28 The question is what, if anything, should be done by the Court in this situation.
