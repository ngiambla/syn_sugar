 1 On 20 March 2007, her Honour, Magistrate Payne, of the Magistrates Court of Queensland pronounced in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, an ex tempore judgment dismissing a claim by the present applicant, A V Jennings Ltd, of copyright infringement on the part of the respondents in respect of the contended reproduction of the applicant's work being a plan for a house.
 The decision of her Honour was thus a decision under Part V of the Copyright Act and an appeal lies from that decision to the Federal Court of Australia ( Ly and Another v Jenkins and Others [2001] FCA 1640 ; (2001) 114 FCR 237 per Sackville J at [69] and following). 6 The exercise of the Court's appellate jurisdiction contemplates applications for leave to appeal or for an extension of time within which to institute an appeal to the Court (s 25(2)(a) and (b)).
 I am satisfied that having regard to all of these matters, the applicant has established 'special circumstances' and accordingly I grant leave to the applicant to file and serve a notice of appeal to the Federal Court of Australia from the orders of her Honour dismissing the applicant's proceeding before the Magistrates Court of Queensland and for that purpose grant an extension of time. 25 As to the costs of the application, although the applicant proceeded on a false assumption, the respondents did not bring about that false assumption.
