 A series of meetings were held between WRVM and the First Delta Group to seek Mr Salvo's assistance to refinance WRVM and, secondly, to discuss the possibility of a joint venture for the development of the Land between WRVM and the First Delta Group.
 AVS contends that, consistent with the provision of the Tranche 1 Loan by way of the third party source DFX2, the Salvern Facility was the source of funds for the provision of the Tranche 2 Loan under the AVS Facility Agreement.
 The purpose of the Salrest Facility was recorded in the letter as being to retire the Salvern Facility (see [41] above) and to provide a further $3,169,000 to assist with the funding of the residential development of the Land.
