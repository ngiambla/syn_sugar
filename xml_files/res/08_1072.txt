 When the matter came on before me on 20 June 2008 Mr Tree SC, who then appeared for the liquidator, advanced argument on the construction of the agreement of 20 March 2007 (the Agreement).
 He alleged that the company and the other parties to the Agreement had breached it and that they "have set about to do a number of extraordinary damaging things, including, in my view, criminal defamation".
 The nature of the allegations made by Mr Diprose rather suggest that the matters in dispute could be extensive. 6 I think in all the circumstances I will confine this hearing to the discrete question of construction raised by the liquidator in his application.
 I stress that any such affidavits are to be limited to the construction of the deed and such necessary facts arising from its surrounding circumstances, and should not deal with the grounds alleged by Mr Diprose for setting aside the Agreement.
