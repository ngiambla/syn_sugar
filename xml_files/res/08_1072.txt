 It seemed to me, however, that it was desirable to give notice to a person likely to be affected by any relief, and accordingly I directed that the application, an affidavit of Mr Hamilton filed on 30 May 2008 and a copy of the transcript of 20 June 2008 be served on Mr David John Diprose.
 I stress that any such affidavits are to be limited to the construction of the deed and such necessary facts arising from its surrounding circumstances, and should not deal with the grounds alleged by Mr Diprose for setting aside the Agreement.
