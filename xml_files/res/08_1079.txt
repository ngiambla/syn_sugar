 As has been observed in other circumstances (see for example Re Pinnacle VRB Ltd (No 9) (No 10) (2001) 40 ACSR 56) , the acceptors would be prejudiced if after acceptance of the offer the bidder did not proceed with an application to have the relevant shares quoted on the ASX. 14 Ausdrill shareholders who have accepted the offer have not yet suffered any real prejudice or loss as a result of MacMahon's delay in making the application for quotation.
