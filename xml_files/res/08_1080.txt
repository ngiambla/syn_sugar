 The second respondent is a distributor within Australia for products manufactured by the first respondent. 6 The applicant claims that since at least June 2005 the first respondent has exported into Australia a clip system known as Clip System F45i, which is sold in connection with the first respondent's line of caravan and recreation vehicle equipment, and which is promoted as a product securing awning systems.
 It is clear from such decisions as Caterpillar [1999] FCA 1503 ; (1999) 48 IPR 1 and earlier decisions of the Full Court (including Sydbank Soenderjylland (A/S) v Bannerton Holdings Proprietary Limited (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 549) that in order to establish a prima facie case for the purposes of O 8 r 3(2), the court does not call for a substantial inquiry.
 The court requires only that there be material before the court, from which inferences are open and which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed. 13 In this case, I am satisfied that a prima facie case exists for the purposes of O 8 r 3(2) Federal Court Rules .
