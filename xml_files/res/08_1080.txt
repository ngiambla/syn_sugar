 The second respondent is a distributor within Australia for products manufactured by the first respondent. 6 The applicant claims that since at least June 2005 the first respondent has exported into Australia a clip system known as Clip System F45i, which is sold in connection with the first respondent's line of caravan and recreation vehicle equipment, and which is promoted as a product securing awning systems.
 The applicant also claims that the first respondent and the second respondent have authorised, procured, or directed an infringement of the patent by consumers in Australia, or in the alternative the supply by the respondents of the clip system to consumers in Australia constitutes an infringement of the patent by the respondents pursuant to s 117 Patents Act . 8 The applicant in this matter also claims additional damages pursuant to s 122(1A) Patents Act . 9 Order 8 r 3(2) Federal Court Rules gives the Court discretion to grant leave to a party to serve originating process on a person in a foreign country in accordance with a convention or a law of a foreign country if the Court is satisfied that: (a) the Court has jurisdiction in the proceeding; (b) the proceeding is of a kind mentioned in the table in O 8 r 3(2); and (c) the person seeking leave has a prima facie case for the relief claimed. 10 This morning Mr Philp for the applicant directed my attention to items 11, 12, 13 and 21 in the table in O 8 r 2 Federal Court Rules .
 It is clear from such decisions as Caterpillar [1999] FCA 1503 ; (1999) 48 IPR 1 and earlier decisions of the Full Court (including Sydbank Soenderjylland (A/S) v Bannerton Holdings Proprietary Limited (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 549) that in order to establish a prima facie case for the purposes of O 8 r 3(2), the court does not call for a substantial inquiry.
 The court requires only that there be material before the court, from which inferences are open and which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed. 13 In this case, I am satisfied that a prima facie case exists for the purposes of O 8 r 3(2) Federal Court Rules .
