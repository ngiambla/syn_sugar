 Mr Booth also remembers being told that the company had a large shareholder who held about 7 per cent of the issued stock. 18 Mr Booth made notes of the meeting.
 His evidence is that he did not tell Mr Booth that shares were to be issued so that the directors would not "lose [control of] the shell".
 Mr Bellman said that apart from telling Mr Booth about the Octapharma transaction he told him he was looking for investors so that LFE could "move forward into the future".
