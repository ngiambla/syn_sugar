 Where a solicitor acts for himself or herself there cannot be independent and impartial advice, and this is in principle a strong reason for holding that a solicitor litigant should not be entitled to costs of acting for him or herself. 26 However, I do not believe that it is open to me to follow the Supreme Court of Western Australia, or to discard the Chorley exception.
 Thirdly, in Khera v Jones [2006] NSWCA 85 , a Court of Appeal constituted by Mason P and Ipp JA (who, it will be remembered, had given the first instance judgment in Dobree), while indicating a preference, if the matter were uncluttered by authority, for the approach adopted in Dobree, refused leave to appeal on the basis that there was little reason to think that the court would depart from its "firm and comparatively recent decision" in Atlas.
 Subsequently, in the Federal Court of Australia, Dowsett J in A D Douglas Pty Ltd v Lawyers Private Mortgages Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 690 , has agreed (at [10]) that Guss and Cachia state the law in Australia, and that the Chorley exception applies. 8 In Winn [2007] VSC 360 , Kaye J said: 4 The applicable principles are quite longstanding and not significantly in dispute.
 See for example London Scottish Benefit Society v Chorley, Crawford and Chester, Guss v Veenhuizen (No.2). 5 On the other hand, it is well established that a litigant in person other than a solicitor is not entitled to costs including costs arising from time spent in preparing for the case.
