 In particular they submit that the Trustees must plead and prove: (a) the consideration that Devere gave to the Andonys; (b) the value of that consideration; and (c) the market value of the Andonys' undivided one third interest in the Land. 14 The applicants contend that whilst paragraph 5 denies the allegation that the consideration was $45,000 and pleads what the consideration actually was, it does not answer an allegation by the Trustees that the identified consideration pleaded in para 18 of the statement of claim had a particular value and then assert that it had a different value.
 Accordingly their complaint, properly understood, is directed at the order that they particularise the monetary value of each "benefit". 16 The applicants submit that the monetary value of each of the items of the consideration, and the other particulars ordered, properly understood, are not particulars of the applicants' case, because they are not particulars of the material facts that are pleaded in para 5.
 If the Trustees do not do this, and proceed at trial on the sole basis that the consideration was $45,000, the applicants submit that they will fail if the Court finds that additional consideration was provided irrespective of the value of that additional consideration. 17 They submit that the primary Court erred by reversing the onus of proof in respect of the elements of s 120(1).
