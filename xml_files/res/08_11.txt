 The applicant's conviction within the four years preceding his application meant that he did not satisfy the criteria for the grant of a Subclass 866 Permanent Protection visa, but was to be considered for the grant of a Subclass 785 Temporary Protection visa. 16 The application for the Protection visa was for a time dealt with by a s 65 delegate, Ms Kate Watson, who authored a "Decision Record" document which she signed and dated 5 December 2006.
 The relationship between PIC 4001 and s 501 of the Act 84 There is a further aspect of the relationship between ss 65 and 501 and the scope of the authority of the s 65 and s 501(1) delegates respectively that must be considered. 85 It will be recalled that s 65(1)(a)(ii) had the effect of requiring a s 65 delegate to be satisfied that the criteria for the Temporary Protection visa prescribed by the Regulations were satisfied.
 Substituting the name of the s 65 delegate Ms Watson for "the Minister", those alternatives become: (c) [Ms Watson] has decided not to refuse to grant a visa to the applicant despite reasonably suspecting that the applicant does not pass the character test; or (d) [Ms Watson] has decided not to refuse to grant a visa to the applicant despite not being satisfied that the applicant passes the character test.
 It would be only an actual decision under s 501(1) to refuse to grant a visa that would defeat s 65(1)(a) 's requirement that a visa be granted. 94 Some force may be thought to be lent to counsel's submission by s 65A ' s 90 day time limit for the s 65 delegate either to grant or refuse to grant the visa.
