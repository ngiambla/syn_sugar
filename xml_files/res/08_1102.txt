 Counsel for RTI points out that the proposed exploitation is by manufacture and supply of syringes identical to those exhibited to Mr Jenkins' affidavit, not those handed up in the course of submissions.
 Each syringe consists of a hollow barrel with, at one end (the "forward end"), a needle capable of piecing skin and underlying tissue for the purpose of injecting fluid.
 The case has been conducted upon the basis that there are three specific "features" (or integers) of claim 1 of the RTI patent which are not found in the samples.
 The retraction mechanism comprises a needle holder, a passage-way by which fluid flows into the needle and a spring designed to force the needle into the retraction cavity in the plunger.
