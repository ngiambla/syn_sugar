 Each syringe consists of a hollow barrel with, at one end (the "forward end"), a needle capable of piecing skin and underlying tissue for the purpose of injecting fluid.
 The retraction mechanism comprises a needle holder, a passage-way by which fluid flows into the needle and a spring designed to force the needle into the retraction cavity in the plunger.
