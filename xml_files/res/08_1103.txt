 It is no part of the prosecution case that it concerns a price at which a member of the public might have been able to purchase a diamond of comparable quality, size and description in the marketplace to that diamond which has become the subject of a particular amended charge.
 Beyond that, it seems that the Corporate Defendant is a presently trading corporation, and again that is a reminder of a need for specific deterrence in relation to further conduct in the marketplace. 27 General deterrence, in my respectful opinion, is a particularly pertinent consideration on sentencing in this instance.
 Rather, the occasion for aggregate sentencing is supplied by s 4K(4) of the Crimes Act . 34 Further, one must, in my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, have regard to the principle of totality when sentencing, even though the sentence be by way of the imposition of a fine.
