 1 On 28 March 2008, the Court dismissed an application brought by Blue Wedges Inc to challenge the decision of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (the Minister) to approve the channel deepening project involving the dredging of Port Philip Bay: Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 399 ( Blue Wedges ).
 All but the first and last sentences are equally applicable to the approval decision of the Minister considered by the Court in this proceeding. 6 The central question was whether there were sufficient special circumstances to justify departure from the general rule.
 The first argument was that the grounds raised in this application concerned significant issues as to the interpretation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (the Act) and the future administration of it.
 No complex question of statutory interpretation arose in the determination of this argument. 9 The final ground argued by the applicant was that the Minister had failed to consider a number of specified relevant matters in breach of the requirements of s 136 of the Act.
