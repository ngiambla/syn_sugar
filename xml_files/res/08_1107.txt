 INTRODUCTION 1 On 14 July 2008 the applicant ("Mr Carantinos") obtained orders from the duty judge allowing him to file an originating process and two affidavits in Court and abridging time for their service on the basis that the matter be returnable before the duty judge at 10:15 am on 21 July 2008.
 This is made plain by the fact that Mr Carantinos's claim for relief in this Court is advanced, as his written submissions reveal, on the following bases: (i) The applicant sought an undertaking that the respondent would not enforce a judgment entered in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by enforcement proceedings including bankruptcy proceedings.
 The decision of the Court of Appeal is presently reserved. (iii) The respondent chose to serve a bankruptcy notice at an address known to be a business address of the applicant without recourse to his home address or the address of his then and present legal advisors. 6 It is not in dispute that the Federal Magistrates Court has jurisdiction in respect of the justiciable controversy between the parties concerning the respondent's entitlement to obtain a sequestration order in respect of Mr Carantinos's estate.
 Moreover, all of the factors on which Mr Carantinos wished to rely before this Court on seeking the anti-suit injunction can be raised by him in the Federal Magistrates Court in opposing the making of the sequestration order sought by the creditor's petition (s 52(2)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act ).
