 Roderick Mackay Sutherland (Mr Sutherland) is the voluntary administrator of each company. 2 Unfortunately, Mr Sutherland overlooked the date (3 July 2008) to which the second meeting of creditors of each company convened under s 439A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) was adjourned pursuant to s 439B(2) of the Act.
 In consequence, he did not send out a notice to creditors reminding or advising them of the adjourned date, and neither he nor any creditor attended at the time and place to which the meeting was adjourned. 3 Mr Sutherland sought an order which would enable a second meeting of creditors of each company to take place.
 Mr Lumley was the Secretary of LMP and Mr Miskiewicz was the Secretary of ZLM. 7 On 14 March 2008, each company appointed Mr Sutherland as administrator pursuant to s 436A of the Act. 8 By notice dated 18 March 2008, Mr Sutherland convened the first meeting of the creditors of each company pursuant to s 436E of the Act, to be held on 27 March 2008 at the offices of Mr Sutherland's firm, Jirsch Sutherland, in the case of ZLM at 10.30 am and in the case of LMP at 11.00 am.
 In each case, the creditors did not appoint a committee of creditors and did not remove and replace Mr Sutherland as administrator. 9 By notice dated 21 April 2008, Mr Sutherland convened the second meeting of the creditors of each company pursuant to s 439A of the Act, to be held on 30 April 2008 at the offices of Jirsch Sutherland, in the case of ZLM at 9.00 am and in the case of LMP at 9.30 am.
 The date 21 April 2008 was within the convening period specified in s 439A(5) of the Act, and the date 30 April 2008 was within the period specified in s 439A(2) of the Act for the holding of the meeting. 10 At their meetings on 30 April 2008, the creditors of the respective companies resolved that their meeting be adjourned to 3 July 2008 at the offices of Jirsch Sutherland, in the case of ZLM at 10.30 am and in the case of LMP at 11.00 am.
 Although the dates for the adjourned meeting were entered into a centralised diary system which members of my staff and I maintain for the purpose of keeping track of various deadlines in respect of the administrations under my control, no entry was made to enable preparation of a further supplementary report to creditors providing an update on my Investigations and a recommendation in relation to the resolution of creditors at the adjourned second meeting. 45.
 As far as I can recall, this is the only voluntary administration in which I have been the administrator in which the adjourned date for the second meeting of creditors has been missed. 14 At the times assigned for the meetings on 3 July 2008, neither Mr Sutherland nor any creditor attended the meeting room at the offices of Jirsch Sutherland.
 The reference to a resolution under s 439C is a reference to the passing of a resolution at the meeting of creditors convened under s 439A that the company execute a deed of company arrangement or that the administration should end or that the company be wound up.
 Since the administration ended on 3 July 2008, the directors have been at liberty to perform or exercise their functions and powers as directors: see s 437C(1) and (2) of the Act. 21 It is desirable that Mr Sutherland be enabled to complete his investigations and report the results to creditors and that creditors have the opportunity of considering his report and deciding that the companies be wound up or that the administration should end or that they enter into a deed of company arrangement. 22 If a means cannot be found to facilitate the re-convening of the second meeting of creditors, it would be necessary, in order for the present stage to be reached again, for the companies again to appoint an administrator under s 436A of the Act and for the statutory procedure again to be followed.
 In the originating process, Mr Sutherland has referred to s 439B(2) of the Act, which provides: A meeting convened under section 439A may be adjourned from time to time, but the period of the adjournment, or the total of the periods of adjournment, must not exceed 45 business days. 24 In the originating process, Mr Sutherland sought an order under s 447A of the Act to the effect that Pt 5.3A of the Act is to operate in relation to each company as if s 439B(2) had the effect that an adjournment to a date not later than 1 August 2008 was permitted.
