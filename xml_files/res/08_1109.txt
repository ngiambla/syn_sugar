 Roderick Mackay Sutherland (Mr Sutherland) is the voluntary administrator of each company. 2 Unfortunately, Mr Sutherland overlooked the date (3 July 2008) to which the second meeting of creditors of each company convened under s 439A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) was adjourned pursuant to s 439B(2) of the Act.
 In consequence, he did not send out a notice to creditors reminding or advising them of the adjourned date, and neither he nor any creditor attended at the time and place to which the meeting was adjourned. 3 Mr Sutherland sought an order which would enable a second meeting of creditors of each company to take place.
 The date 21 April 2008 was within the convening period specified in s 439A(5) of the Act, and the date 30 April 2008 was within the period specified in s 439A(2) of the Act for the holding of the meeting. 10 At their meetings on 30 April 2008, the creditors of the respective companies resolved that their meeting be adjourned to 3 July 2008 at the offices of Jirsch Sutherland, in the case of ZLM at 10.30 am and in the case of LMP at 11.00 am.
