 It is common ground that amendment of the United States copyright register can only be ordered by a United States court. (m) The provisions of the Act relied on, namely ss 22(4) and 98, are quite different from the co-ownership provisions in Title 17 on which the respondents rely in the Illinois proceeding.
 I infer from s 201 and the definition of "joint work" that the US court has power in those circumstances to grant declarations that the works are "joint works", that Mr Heriot is a co-author of the works within s 201(a) and that Drew Pictures is a joint owner of the works within s 201(b).
 Having regard to the existence of the Illinois proceeding and the circumstances considered above, this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum. 80 In coming to my conclusion, I have not taken into account any assertions of law made in the Complaint that were not proved by expert evidence.
