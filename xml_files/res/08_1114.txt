 The FMCA concluded that the proposed amendments would have no reasonable prospects of success and it would therefore be futile to grant leave to amend the application in the manner sought ( Dowling v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FMCA 845).
 This is an argument which was examined in the earlier decision of 20 December 2007 ( Dowling v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2007] FMCA 2104 ; 169 IR 201 at [55] to [65]) but it was not rejected.
 The orders I will make are: Leave is granted to appeal the decision and orders of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in Dowling v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (No 3) [2008] FMCA 845 to the extent that the applicant was refused leave to amend his application before that Court to rely on s 793(1)(j) and (k) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (Order 1) and to the extent that, as a consequence, his application before that Court was dismissed (Order 2).
