 1 The applicant (Cadbury) brought this proceeding against the respondent (Darrell Lea) alleging passing off and also misleading and deceptive conduct in contravention of ss 52 and 53 (c) and (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) by Darrell Lea's use of the colour purple in connection with the marketing of chocolate products.
 In the course of the trial I rejected evidence tendered by Cadbury from three expert witnesses, Dr Brian Gibbs, Dr Constantino Stavros and Mr Timothy Riches (the Cadbury experts). 2 I gave judgment for Darrell Lea: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) [2006] FCA 446 ; (2006) 229 ALR 136.
 The orders I made, including costs orders, were set aside and the matter was remitted to me for further hearing so that the evidence of the Cadbury experts could be received. 3 After the further hearing Cadbury's application was again dismissed: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 8) (2008) 75 IPR 557.
