 The plaintiffs entered into the agreement without having first obtained approval in the manner prescribed in s 477(2B) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). 2 The plaintiffs now seek relief to the effect that the agreement be approved and that the Court direct that the plaintiffs may act on the agreement as though it had been approved by the Court pursuant to s 477(2B) of the Act.
 Mr Cribb deposes to a long history of trials and tribulations that the plaintiffs have endured in their attempts to dispose of the company's interest in the Mt Thirsty Tenements during the period 2000 to 2005. 4 Some of the difficulties that the plaintiffs confronted in their attempts to dispose of the company's interest in the mining tenements arose from the fact that the tenements were not absolutely owned by the company.
 Accordingly, I approve the agreement entered into by the plaintiffs. 9 The second element of the relief sought, is the giving of a direction that the plaintiffs act on the agreement as if the approval had been granted prior to the execution of the agreement.
