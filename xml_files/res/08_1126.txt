 If those findings were to be "confirmed" by appellate courts they "would be determinative of any factual disputes before the Registrar on similar issues (ie it is inconceivable that the Registrar would make any inconsistent findings in any opposition hearing)".
 The findings by the court "will have a direct and significant bearing on issues of fact [for the purpose of s 41(6)]. " It would be "entirely inappropriate" to continue with the opposition proceedings as that may result in findings of fact that are inconsistent with those made by the Federal Court. 7 The delegate accepted Darrell Lea's argument.
 The suspension would "avoid duplication in the decision making process, and will reduce the chance of inconsistent [factual] finding[s] resulting from the analysis of similar evidence. " 8 The delegate then gave the following direction: "[T]he present oppositions be suspended until the Federal Court decision in the passing off proceeding is handed down.
 Without in any way wishing to be exhaustive, the considerations can include: (a) whether the tribunal has available to it more evidence than was before the judge; (b) whether the arguments put to the tribunal were made to the judge; and (c) whether the tribunal is a specialist body with expert knowledge of the subject matter. 20 Now, in this case I fear that the delegate was intending to place too much emphasis on the judge's or judges' findings.
