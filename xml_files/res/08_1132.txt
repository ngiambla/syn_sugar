 This was rejected by the Tribunal and was not relied on by the respondent on the present appeal. 5 "Alcohol dependence" and "alcohol abuse" are defined in SoP No 76 of 1998 in mutually exclusive terms.
 The Tribunal based its conclusion on a finding as to the latter, which was defined in cl 2(b) of the SoP in these terms: the presence of cognitive, behavioural or physiological symptoms indicating the use of alcohol despite significant alcohol-related problems, however these symptoms have never met the criteria for alcohol dependence.
 The symptoms have never met the criteria for alcohol dependence. 6 Clause 5 of the SoP specifies the factors that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting alcohol abuse with the circumstances of the veteran's service.
 Fitting the template of the SoP 16 In my opinion, the Tribunal erred by failing to form an opinion whether the alcohol abuse hypothesis fitted, or was consistent with, SoP No 76 of 1998 ( Deledio step 3).
