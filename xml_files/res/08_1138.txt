 The nature and history of the proceeding 1 The central issue in this proceeding concerns the meaning of the phrase "relates to matters of an administrative nature", describing a document, in s 5 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) ("the FOI Act ").
 The proper construction of s 5 44 Counsel for the respondent urged the adoption of a purposive construction of s 5 of the FOI Act , in accordance with s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ("the Acts Interpretation Act ").
 There can be little doubt that, if a document deals with matters of an administrative nature, and deals with other matters as well, it does not lose its character as a document relating to matters of an administrative nature simply because it deals with other matters.
