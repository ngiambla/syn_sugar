 Section 459C(2)(a) of the Corporations Act provides: (2) The Court must presume that the company is insolvent if, during or after the 3 months ending on the day when the application was made: (a) the company failed (as defined by section 459F) to comply with a statutory demand. 5 On 10 July 2007 the defendant filed a notice of appearance setting out the following grounds of opposition to the winding up proceedings: (1) The statutory demand cannot found a presumption of insolvency under s 459C(2)(a) of the Corporations Act because it is stale.
 In this regard the application to set the statutory demand aside was not made "in accordance with s 459G" as it was served out of time and the time for compliance with the statutory demand was, in consequence, 21 days after the statutory demand was served on the plaintiff, not 7 days after the decision dismissing the application to set aside the statutory demand: cf s 459F(2)(b). (2) Further or in the alternative, the plaintiff has no standing as of right to make an application to wind up the defendant under s 459P of the Corporations Act because the defendant has an offsetting claim against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is therefore not a creditor, or alternatively, only a contingent creditor. (3) Further or in the alternative the defendant is solvent.
 The defendant also filed the present interlocutory process on 10 July 2007. 6 The affidavit in support of the interlocutory process annexed a number of communications between the parties which suggest that the failed application to set aside the statutory demand was based upon a claimed genuine dispute in relation to the debt the subject of the statutory demand.
