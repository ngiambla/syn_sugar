 In this regard the application to set the statutory demand aside was not made "in accordance with s 459G" as it was served out of time and the time for compliance with the statutory demand was, in consequence, 21 days after the statutory demand was served on the plaintiff, not 7 days after the decision dismissing the application to set aside the statutory demand: cf s 459F(2)(b). (2) Further or in the alternative, the plaintiff has no standing as of right to make an application to wind up the defendant under s 459P of the Corporations Act because the defendant has an offsetting claim against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is therefore not a creditor, or alternatively, only a contingent creditor. (3) Further or in the alternative the defendant is solvent.
 The defendant also filed the present interlocutory process on 10 July 2007. 6 The affidavit in support of the interlocutory process annexed a number of communications between the parties which suggest that the failed application to set aside the statutory demand was based upon a claimed genuine dispute in relation to the debt the subject of the statutory demand.
 It also annexes a copy of a writ dated 27 June 2008 issued out of the Supreme Court of Victoria in which the defendant sought unspecified damages from the plaintiff in relation to what is claimed to be a breach of an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant for the plaintiff to act as the defendant's group general manager and his failure in the course of that to exercise reasonable, proper or professional skill and diligence or act in the best interests of the defendant.
