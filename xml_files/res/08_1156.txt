 As counsel for the Minister pointed out, it is common for amendments to be made to the regulations, and for grandfathering to occur, so that in respect of a particular application a decision maker may be required to apply criteria that were in force at some earlier time.
 That does not, in my view, suggest anything in relation to the power of the regulation maker to say whether a particular set of criteria are to be applied to a particular applicant in either the form they took at the time of application or the time of decision.
