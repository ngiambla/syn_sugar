 The appellant contends that s 93 shows that the legislature envisaged a general rule that an applicant should have the benefit of regulations in force at the time of application , and that the section creates an exception to the general rule. 27 Section 65 of the Act provides that after considering a valid visa application the Minister, if satisfied that the criteria for the visa prescribed by the Act or the regulations have been satisfied, must grant the visa.
 As counsel for the Minister pointed out, it is common for amendments to be made to the regulations, and for grandfathering to occur, so that in respect of a particular application a decision maker may be required to apply criteria that were in force at some earlier time.
 That does not, in my view, suggest anything in relation to the power of the regulation maker to say whether a particular set of criteria are to be applied to a particular applicant in either the form they took at the time of application or the time of decision.
