 1 The applicant, Sharyn Faye Ferris, seeks leave pursuant to s 58(3)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) to commence proceedings for the recovery of loan moneys, together with interest advanced by the applicant to her two brothers, Bevan Robert Schafferius and the bankrupt, Keith Douglas Schafferius.
 The moneys are said to have been lent to the proposed defendants upon terms that the loans would be repaid by them upon the sale of an asset, a motel, by a company in which the borrowers had an interest.
 Some interest has been repaid by the borrowers but the principal and other interest moneys remain outstanding. 2 Leave is sought in terms of Annexure 'MLM-01' of the affidavit of Margaret Laurelle McNamara, and that exhibit attaches an application and statement of claim.
