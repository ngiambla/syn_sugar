 Mr Watson appeals from a decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) made on 7 February 2007. 2 The Commissioner decided in relation to the financial year ended 30 June 2004 that payments Mr Watson received under a personal income protection insurance policy were not assessable income from his business activity as a financial planner.
 His business activity otherwise operated at a loss for that year of income, but it would not have done so if Mr Watson could have included the income from the personal income protection insurance policy as assessable income of the business.
 No activities by him in the business, including the incidental or ancillary activities (such as record keeping, filing, banking, research, general administration tasks, insuring business assets and the like), have related to him continuing to receive the partial disability payments under the PIP policy.
