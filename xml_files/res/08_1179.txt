 Mr Priestley says that would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of that judge because he or she has therefore been influenced by Parliament. 11 Mr Priestley proffers two alternatives to myself or any other judge of the Court hearing his matter.
 He submits that the matter could be referred to the High Court under s 40 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') and that he could apply for a writ of prohibition and ask the High Court to issue s 78B notices in order for the High Court to examine the constitutional validity of s 31A of the Act.
 Mr Priestley submits that, under s 21A of the Human Rights Act , a court must be independent and that this Court has compromised its independence by abrogating the previous rule in the Federal Court Rules and establishing O 20 r 5. 30 Mr Priestley is not suggesting that he is not getting a public hearing.
