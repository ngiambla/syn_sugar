 Subsection 196B(14)(d) states that a factor causing or contributing to a disease is related to service if: (d) it was contributed to in a material degree by, or was aggravated by, that service; ... 9 The Authority has determined a Statement of Principles, Instrument No. 16 of 1998, for IFA.
 Third Ground of Appeal 53 The applicant claims that the Tribunal was required to find whether any inability to obtain appropriate clinical management was related to Mr Money's service in one of the ways set out in s 196B(14).
 As noted above, one of those relationships is that prescribed by s 196B(14)(a), which states that a factor contributing to a disease (here, inability to obtain appropriate clinical management) can be related to service if it "resulted from an occurrence that happened while the person was rendering that service".
 In its reasons, the Tribunal explicitly found that one of the circumstances of Mr Money's service --- and therefore an occurrence during his service --- was that "the Navy's medical system, on this particular occasion, failed to deliver appropriate clinical management" to Mr Money.
