 The Commissioner wishes to make a determination under s 177F of the ITAA 1936, and, consequentially, to make an amended assessment of the amount of JHAF's taxable income and of the tax payable on it under ss 166 and 170 of that Act in respect of the year ended 31 March 2002.
 I agree that he cannot do so because, as noted earlier, upon deregistration of a company it ceases to exist . 16 In my view, the facts recounted above show that the Commissioner is a person aggrieved by the deregistration of JHAF and has standing to apply for reinstatement of its registration.
 The statements claim that on 1 November 2001, JHAF "transferred all its assets and liabilities" to JHIFBV, and that "[c]onsequently on 02 November, 2001 [JHFBV] contributed all its assets and liabilities to [JHIFBV], the consideration being the issue of 10,000 shares". 28 The statement that on November 1 JHAF transferred its assets to JHIFBV is difficult to reconcile with other evidence.
