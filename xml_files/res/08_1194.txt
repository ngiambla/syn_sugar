 In 1987, Professor Banwell was approximately 33 years of age. (1) Professor Banwell was taught the fundamental principles of stereochemistry as an undergraduate student in the 1970s and possessed at that time copies of leading stereochemistry texts used to teach undergraduate students.
 Thus, the patentee's contention is that this is something new and different --- novel --- in form and in substance. 45 On the other hand, the formula identified as derivative 1 or example 1 in the French patent and corresponding patents (PCR 4099) has the identical formula to the enantiomer in suit.
 Reading the specification as a whole, the skilled addressee would discern that the patentee had not isolated the individual enantiomers and that the absolute stereochemistry of the more active enantiomer, and that of the less active enantiomer, had not been defined.
