 On 16 June 2008, I adjourned the hearing of the application for the making of orders approving the Scheme until 24 June 2008 because I was not satisfied with the evidence. 4 On 24 June 2008, I again adjourned the hearing of UKL's application and directed that UKL write to its members advising them of new information which had come into existence since the meeting of members which had approved the Scheme.
 The italicised words are not included in Form 6 of the Corporations Rules. 12 Out of an abundance of caution, UKL also published notices on 13 June 2008 advising of the second Court hearing in a form which complied with the terms of Form 6.
 However, these notices, being published on 13 June 2008, did not give at least five days notice of the Court hearing. 13 UKL submitted that the first notice which it published on 9 June 2008 complied with the Corporations Rules notwithstanding that it contained the additional words referred to above and so did not replicate the language in Form 6.
 The evidence before me indicates that for the exemption to be effective, the court in question must have sufficient information before it to determine the value of both the securities to be surrendered and the securities to be issued in the proposed transaction.
