 The loan was to be used not only to fund the construction directly, but also to pay out an existing Suncorp Metway first mortgage, and an existing PIFA-2000 HYIP facility. 55 The security for the loan was a first registered mortgage over the Bonney Avenue Property and unlimited joint and several guarantees by Mr Ryan, Rycorp and Rycorp Properties.
 The amount of the facility offered was $2,500,000 or a maximum of 90% of valuation, whichever was the lesser. 60 Two years earlier, on 6 September 2000, Meritstock had accepted a loan of $900,000 (the loan having been offered in a letter addressed to Meritstock and dated 5 September 2000), secured by, inter alia, a second mortgage over the Boondall Shopping Centre at 2115-2121 Sandgate Road, Boondall, Queensland (the Boondall Property).
 The letter of offer of the Boondall Facility stated that the second registered mortgage over the Boondall Property was to be "Subject to First Mortgage to Premium Income Fund of Australia", that is, subject to a first mortgage to PIFA. 62 It will be recalled that the sales of the Bonney Avenue Property and the Pashen Street Property resulted in large shortfalls.
 Accordingly, the second mortgage over the Bonney Avenue Property and the third mortgage over the Pashen Street Property were of no value as security for the Boondall Facility. 63 An internal Mercator memorandum dated 7 March 2002, enclosing a loan recommendation for the Boondall Facility, stated that Meritstock was at that time a borrower both from the PIFA and PIFA-2000 Funds, and that the Boondall Facility that was being sought was to "assist in the payout of borrowings from Colonial Bank" and "to payout a current loan with PIFA".
 The memorandum continued: The current securities prepared by previous solicitors are all over the shop, the affirmation of these securities and a new deed of security will enhance and confirm the funds [sic] legal position and create the overall debts into one borrowing entity that holds the security property we are relying on and reconfirms debentures and guarantees and an understanding of repayment obligations. 78 The foreshadowed security deed (the Security Deed) was dated 22 May 2003 and was expressed to be made between Perpetual as responsible entity for PIFA-2000 (called the "Lender"), Rycorp Properties, Closemarket and Mr and Mrs Ryan.
 The Security Deed recited that Rycorp and Meritstock were both in liquidation, and that Rycorp Properties, Closemarket and Mr and Mrs Ryan had requested Perpetual to continue to provide financial accommodation and to refrain from taking immediate enforcement action under "the Securities" and various guarantees notwithstanding the liquidations.
 Financial Report on the Scheme for the year ended 30 June 2003 86 In the Financial Report of the Scheme for the year ended 30 June 2003, Note 6 stated that the borrower (that is, Meritstock) had entered into a new security deed (that is, the Security Deed) and Deed of Affirmation, at which time all accrued interest was backdated to March 2003.
 The amount notionally available for distribution then becomes $1,404,739.76, being the total of $790,084.34 (the proceeds of the first mortgage over the Mount Warren Park Property) and $614,655.42 (the proceeds of the second mortgage over the Boondall Property as at the date of hearing). 121 On the basis of a 38 %/62 % apportionment, the FMIP would be entitled to $533,801.11 and the HYIP would be entitled to $870,938.65. 122 On a third view, being the view which I consider to be correct, the first mortgage over the Mount Warren Park Property was an Asset solely of the FMIP, and the second mortgage over the Boondall Property was an Asset solely of the HYIP.
 For example, if the Mount Warren Park Property was an Asset solely of the FMIP, and the second mortgage over the Boondall Property was an Asset solely of the HYIP, as I concluded above, the inclusion of the shortfall from the first mortgage over the Mount Warren Park Property would indeed increase the debt secured by the second mortgage over the Boondall Property.
 THE LIBBIAN PTY LTD (LIBBIAN) FACILITY AND THE UPPER ROMA STREET PROPERTY 140 The second of the two properties, the proceeds of sale of which are yet to be distributed, and about which Stacks seeks directions, is a property situated at 452-454 Upper Roma Street, Brisbane (the Upper Roma Street Property).
 Evidence that the Libbian Facility and the security over the Upper Roma Street Property were owned by the HYIP The second mortgage over the Upper Roma Street Property 141 On 8 October 2001, Mercator issued a letter of offer to Libbian for the provision of a loan of $1,660,000 on behalf of the PIFA-2000 Project Development Fund (that is, the PIFA-2000 HYIP).
 Support for this view is found in the fact that the Supplementary Prospectus dated 18 September 2003 makes no reference to the purchase of the first mortgage under the equivalent heading for the FMIP. 164 On 20 November 2003, Mercator wrote to Libbian enclosing a "loan statement" for "the first mortgage loan".
