 The making of this book entry suggests an intention that the amount was to be treated thenceforth as owing to the HYIP and no longer as owing to the FMIP. 97 On 11 March 2003, the interest owing on the Bonney Avenue Facility of $266,294.63 was also credited to the Bonney Avenue Facility FMIP Account and debited to F1.
 It is to be noted that the FMIP would, on this view, receive the amount of $70,000 in addition to the $790,084.34 that it received from the proceeds of the first mortgage over the Mount Warren Park Property. 119 On an alternative view, both the FMIP and the HYIP had a beneficial interest in both the first mortgage over the Mount Warren Park Property and the second mortgage over the Boondall Property according to their respective contributions to the Boondall Facility.
 For example, if the Mount Warren Park Property was an Asset solely of the FMIP, and the second mortgage over the Boondall Property was an Asset solely of the HYIP, as I concluded above, the inclusion of the shortfall from the first mortgage over the Mount Warren Park Property would indeed increase the debt secured by the second mortgage over the Boondall Property.
