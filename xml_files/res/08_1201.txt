 Those pleadings, they contend, define the ambit of the dispute between the parties and the ambit of evidence relevant or potentially relevant to the resolution of that dispute. 21 The Applicants want to continue to access the materials seized as an aid to the discovery process and in order to be able to further particularise their claims.
 His Honour there further observed that: [70] ... where, extraordinarily, the Court judges that it is, in the particular circumstances, appropriate to order general discovery, in the absence of any special (ad hoc) restriction, the traditional (broad) obligation to discover any document relating to any matter in question in the proceeding will continue to apply.
 In the absence of any such contention, and notwithstanding the fact that a copy of the documents seized remains available to the Court, it is presently considered that the documents seized should remain available pending the resolution of the proceeding. 70 Pursuant to the terms of the orders made, records have also been kept of those who have inspected the seized documents and materials.
 Restricting the assistance to be provided to the Applicants' solicitors and counsel to a single person will inevitably prolong any review process -- it will take the Applicants longer to review the documents and it will delay the return to the Respondents of documents which are of no relevance to the existing proceeding.
