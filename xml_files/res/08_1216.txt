 It was contended that the application did not fall within s 476A of the Act which prescribes the limits of the Court's original jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for judicial review in relation to migration decisions. 19 It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the originating application. 20 The only potential head of jurisdiction in s 476A of the Act which could apply in the circumstances of this case is s 476A(1)(c) of the Act, which provides as follows: (1) Despite any other law, including section 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 and section 8 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 , the Federal Court has original jurisdiction in relation to a migration decision if, and only if: ... (c) the decision is a privative clause decision, or purported privative clause decision, made personally by the Minister under section 501, 501A, 501B or 501C. 21 Section 5 of the Act provides that a "migration decision" includes a "privative clause decision".
 In Osborne v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 1113 ; (2002) 124 FCR 416 , French J observed that it was implied in the Act that a notice of intention to cancel the visa would be given as a "necessary condition" of the exercise of the power to cancel a visa under s 501 of the Act. 25 In my view, the giving of the notice of intention to cancel the visa under s 501 of the Act, is a privative clause decision within the meaning of s 5 of the Act, because the conduct comprising the giving of the notice falls within the ambit of the conduct described in s 474(3)(g) and s 474(3)(h) of the Act referred to in [22] above. 26 The conduct engaged in the giving of the notice of intention to cancel Mr Fernando's visa was, as is evidenced by the letter of 16 April 2007, the conduct of an officer of the department and not the Minister personally.
 For that reason, there is also no jurisdiction to hear and determine the claim for that relief. 28 However, the third claim for relief, namely, the injunction to restrain the respondent and his officers from cancelling Mr Fernando's visa is capable of being granted independently of the success of Mr Fernando in respect of the primary relief which he seeks, namely, the setting aside of the notice of intention to cancel Mr Fernando's visa issued on 16 April 2007.
