 Mr Denison told me that he had looked at the shape and behaviour of a venetian blind slat and thought that a roadside post could be constructed from a "spring" steel formed to a similar curved shape, which would have the ability to return to its original form when bent.
 It is contended for Dura-Post that there is a real and reasonably clear disclosure in the specification of a roadside post that will avoid the adverse consequences of creasing in the event of a wheel over.
 It is said that this will occur only where the post is used with a recess, but the roadside post claims contain no limitation that reflects the nature of the invention as disclosed and described in the body of the specification.
