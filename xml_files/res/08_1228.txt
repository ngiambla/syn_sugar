 1 On 1 August 2008 I ordered that Robert John Boylan be substituted as plaintiff for Johnson Winter Slattery: see Johnson Winter Slattery in the matter of Firepower Operations Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1227. 2 On 4 August 2008 I ordered that the defendant be wound up in insolvency and that Bryan Kenneth Hughes be liquidator.
 In his capacity as a voluntary administrator, Mr McDonald has also been giving instructions on behalf of the defendant to the defendant's legal representatives. 7 In the earlier reasons for judgment I explained why I found that the defendant was insolvent and should be wound up, but deferred making the winding up order pending resolution of the issue as to who should be appointed liquidator. 8 Rolen Pty Ltd (Rolen), a company of which Ross John Graham is a director, claims to be a substantial creditor of the defendant.
 He submits that there ought to be an opportunity for this to happen. 12 Mr J T Johnson, counsel for Mr Boylan, submits that there is no evidence that Mr Hughes will not act impartially in deciding the question whether Rolen is a creditor of the defendant. 13 If one puts Rolen to one side, the larges two creditors of the defendant, according to an interim list of creditors dated 23 July 2008 prepared by the voluntary administrators, are Firepower Investments Pty Ltd and Green Triton Ltd, which are owed in all $13,037,662.00 out of total debts of $16,289,624.01 according.
 It is true, as Mr Kidd pointed out, that given time another creditor or group of creditors may see fit to fund Mr Kijurina, but against that possibility it is to be weighed the present undertaking proffered to the Court by Mr Graham. 19 It was for the above reasons that I made orders on 4 August 2008 that the defendant be wound up and that Bryan Kevin Hughes be liquidator.
