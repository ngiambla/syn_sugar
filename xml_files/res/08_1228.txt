 1 On 1 August 2008 I ordered that Robert John Boylan be substituted as plaintiff for Johnson Winter Slattery: see Johnson Winter Slattery in the matter of Firepower Operations Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1227. 2 On 4 August 2008 I ordered that the defendant be wound up in insolvency and that Bryan Kenneth Hughes be liquidator.
 In his capacity as a voluntary administrator, Mr McDonald has also been giving instructions on behalf of the defendant to the defendant's legal representatives. 7 In the earlier reasons for judgment I explained why I found that the defendant was insolvent and should be wound up, but deferred making the winding up order pending resolution of the issue as to who should be appointed liquidator. 8 Rolen Pty Ltd (Rolen), a company of which Ross John Graham is a director, claims to be a substantial creditor of the defendant.
