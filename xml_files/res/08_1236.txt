 The nature and history of the proceeding 1 The essential question in this proceeding is whether the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") applied the wrong test when considering the issue of the availability of state protection in the context of an application for a protection visa.
 The Tribunal also find [sic] that the applicant would not be denied such protection for reasons of his membership of a particular social group...Therefore the applicant's fears of harm from individuals and vigilante groups because he is an identified child sex offender or paedophile are not well founded. 10 The Tribunal then dealt with the appellant's expressed fear of retribution by the brothers of his victim, who live in England and are aware of his crimes.
 It found that there was no evidence that the brothers had threatened the appellant with any physical harm or other type of harm apart from revealing his name to the media, or that they had taken any steps to harm him in the past.
