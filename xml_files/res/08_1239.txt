 My reasons for confirming the Scheme are set out below. 2 I also refer in this judgment to an order made on 29 November 2007 dispensing with compliance with the provisions of s 17C(2)(c) of the Act which requires an approved summary of a scheme to be given to every affected policyholder.
 It seemed to me that the terms of s 17C(5) of the Act do not preclude dispensation being granted on more than one occasion. 24 In exercising my discretion to make the dispensation orders, I took into account the fact that APRA did not object, that the Scheme is between companies in the same Group, and the widespread nature of the advertising: Re Calliden Group Ltd [2007] FCA 2019 at [62] (Lindgren J).
 This accords with the main object of the Act which is expressed in s 2A(1) , namely, to protect the interests of policyholders. 31 In the GIO case Emmett J was satisfied upon the basis of a joint actuarial report that there was not likely to be any material detriment to the owners of policies affected by the Scheme.
 This is not to suggest that the Court abdicates the decision to APRA (cf, in a similar context, Re Metlife Insurance Ltd (2007) 63 ACSR 492 , [2007] FCA 1327 at [28] , [30] and [37]). 35 The relevant authorities were collected and referred to by Katz J in Re Royal Son Alliance [2000] FCA 1259 ; 104 FCR 37 at [25] ---[27].
