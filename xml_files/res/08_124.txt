 1 This is an application brought under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") for review of a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") which refused an application for reinstatement under s 42A(10) of the AAT Act : see YBCF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 1863.
 This additional documentation would be sought to substantiate an argument that Mr Jones, by withdrawing the application before the Tribunal in 1996, had acted beyond his instructions, and that the applicant did not give "informed consent" to the withdrawal and consequent dismissal of the review application.
 In substance, this argument seeks to challenge the clear factual findings made by the Tribunal at [12] of its reasons that there was no evidence that Mr Jones made a mistake in the execution of his client's instructions by withdrawing the review application.
 Mr Karp submitted that the Tribunal, because it neither considered nor found that there was "informed consent" on the part of the applicant to the withdrawal of the review application, but rather simply observed that the applicant had given general instructions to Mr Jones to procure a particular outcome by whatever means he thought best, thus committed jurisdictional error. 9 There are two difficulties with this submission.
