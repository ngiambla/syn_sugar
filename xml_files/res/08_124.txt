 1 This is an application brought under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act ") for review of a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") which refused an application for reinstatement under s 42A(10) of the AAT Act : see YBCF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 1863.
 This additional documentation would be sought to substantiate an argument that Mr Jones, by withdrawing the application before the Tribunal in 1996, had acted beyond his instructions, and that the applicant did not give "informed consent" to the withdrawal and consequent dismissal of the review application.
