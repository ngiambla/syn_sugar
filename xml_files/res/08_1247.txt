 The application made today is for orders to extend the time within which the meeting must be held. 2 The purpose of the second meeting of creditors is to decide the company's future.
 The creditors have three options to choose from: that the company execute a deed of company arrangement; that the administration end; and that the company be wound up: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), s 439C.
 To enable the creditors to make an informed choice the administrators must investigate the company's affairs and report the result to the creditors: s 439A(4). 3 Here the administrators need more time to prepare their report.
