 The first is that the amount is the balance of the contract sum following the earlier completion of, and payment for, the construction work specified under the contract: that is, it is a claim for profits only.
 The second is that some, or all, of the amount is for construction work or ancillary activities (which might be given some support by a trade breakdown for the project provided by Lorne Bay to the superintendent on 14 May 2008).
 The other is that Protectavale and K2K are to hold the moneys "in trust ... for [Lorne Bay] until ... [Lorne Bay] is entitled to receive them", in which case Protectavale and K2K are entitled to the interest.
