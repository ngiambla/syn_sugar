 The point in dispute is how is a "week's pay" is to be determined. 3 The award defines "week's pay" to mean "the ordinary time rate of pay for the employee concerned", with certain rates and allowances excluded.
 I did, for a time, toy with the notion that the composite expression "the ordinary time rate of pay for the employee concerned" drew attention to the rate actually paid to the "employee concerned".
 The question is whether s 507(2) applies when determining the amount to which an employee is entitled by way of payment in lieu of notice. 7 The cases say that if an employer is entitled to dismiss an employee summarily but the contract provides that the employee is entitled to payment in lieu of notice, the employee's claim for payment is not by way of damages for wrongful dismissal but is a debt due under the agreement.
 They are breaches of: (1) cl 4.4.3 of the award (failing to make the redundancy payments); and (2) cl 4.3.1 (failing to make payments in lieu of notice). 10 In Kelly v Fitzpatrick (2007) 166 IR 14, Tracey J referred to the many considerations to be taken into account when determining penalty. 11 The matters which I regard as important in this case are these.
