 1 This is an application under s 476A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act ") seeking an order setting aside a decision of the second respondent ("the Tribunal") which affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent ("the Minister") to cancel Mr Green's transitional (permanent) visa pursuant to s 501 of the Act : see Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 1410.
 As a result, it is said, Mr Green did not have an opportunity to challenge these conclusions. 38 In my view, there was no obligation on the part of Tribunal to inform Mr Green of its views regarding his credibility and the weight which it was prepared to give his evidence.
 Although it was for the Tribunal to weigh Mr Green's evidence and in so doing form a view as to his credibility, the reasoning involved in this task did not need to be signalled. 39 Secondly, it is said that the Tribunal ought to have sought further evidence from persons who made statements but were not called to give oral evidence.
