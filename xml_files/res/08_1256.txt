 The pro forma attached recites that the agreement is made for the purpose of providing Commonwealth financial assistance to the State under s 19 of the Natural Heritage Act, s 16 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 (Cth) and s 5 of the Financial Assistance Act.
 On the other hand, as suggested above, if any of the Inter-Governmental Agreements effected or authorised an acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms, and that agreement was only authorised by either of the Commonwealth Statutes, it may be arguable that that inter-governmental agreement was invalid or inoperative, to the extent that it effected or authorised such an acquisition.
 Mr Spencer's submissions do not expand on those propositions. 183 However, Mr Spencer's claim for an order that the Commonwealth return to him any property expropriated or acquired and his claim for damages must depend upon a finding that the Commonwealth has itself or by its servants or agents, in some way, acquired property of Mr Spencer's.
