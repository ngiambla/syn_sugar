 Lynx has filed a cross-appeal in the Appeal Proceeding. 3 Proceeding NSD 2461 of 2007 ( the Threats Proceeding ) is a claim by Bradken that a letter of 11 October 2007 ( the Threats Letter ) to BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Limited ( BHP ) constitutes unjustifiable threats by Lynx within s 128 of the Patents Act 1990 (Cth) ( the 1990 Act ).
 It says that those allegations establish a direct and immediate connection, namely, that the breaches of confidence, infringement of copyright and contravention of the Trade Practices Act alleged enabled Bradken to do the acts that Lynx alleges would be an infringement of a patent if one is granted to Lynx pursuant to the Patent Application.
 In the Threats Proceeding, Bradken claims an order that Lynx pay damages pursuant to s 129 and that an enquiry be held to determine the nature and extent of Bradken's loss and damage occasioned by reason of the alleged threats and to assess the quantum of that loss and damage.
