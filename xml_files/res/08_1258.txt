 The Tribunal also raised with the [appellant] whether or not, even if the Tribunal did accept her claim of past harm, whether she faced serious harm on her return to Indonesia.
 In particular the Tribunal needed to consider whether the [appellant] not being able to do visits to the poor in the manner that she so wished amounted to persecution by reasons of her religion.
 The Tribunal did not accept that in the face of such conduct, the appellant would have continued with the visits for such a lengthy period, or that her parents or parish priest would have permitted her to do so.
