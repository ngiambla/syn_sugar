 In those circumstances, the Tribunal member cannot regard himself or herself as limited to dealing only with the facts and issues that were perceived by an earlier Tribunal member who has made a decision that has been set aside.

 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11 , 215 CLR 518 at 540---1 Gummow and Hayne JJ explained the position as follows: [71] In adversarial litigation, findings of fact that are made will reflect the joinder of issue between the parties.
 The person who has sought the review seeks a particular administrative decision -- in this case the grant of a protection visa -- and puts to the Tribunal whatever material or submission that person considers will assist that claim.
