 1 These reasons arise from an application by the applicants ("Brother") for an order for costs on an indemnity basis, having been substantially successful in proceedings against the respondent ("Dynamic Supplies") concerning infringement of trade marks and other matters: see Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 507.
 The application for indemnity costs relies not only on Dynamic Supplies' rejection of several offers of compromise made by Brother before the hearing but also on the manner in which the litigation was conducted by Dynamic Supplies. 2 Three offers of compromise were made by Brother to Dynamic Supplies before the hearing on trade mark infringement.
