 1 These reasons arise from an application by the applicants ("Brother") for an order for costs on an indemnity basis, having been substantially successful in proceedings against the respondent ("Dynamic Supplies") concerning infringement of trade marks and other matters: see Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd (2007) 73 IPR 507.
 The application for indemnity costs relies not only on Dynamic Supplies' rejection of several offers of compromise made by Brother before the hearing but also on the manner in which the litigation was conducted by Dynamic Supplies. 2 Three offers of compromise were made by Brother to Dynamic Supplies before the hearing on trade mark infringement.
 O 23 r 11(4) provides that if an offer is made by an applicant and not accepted by a respondent, and the applicant obtains a judgment on the claim to which the offer relates which is not less favourable than the terms of the offer, then, unless the Court otherwise orders, the applicant is entitled to an order against the respondent for costs incurred in respect of the claim up to the day when the offer was made taxed on a party-party basis and after that day taxed on an indemnity basis.
 Because I am not satisfied that these two offers were more favourable to Dynamic Supplies than the judgment on the claims to which the offers relate, I do not consider that O 23 r 11(4) is activated in relation to the first and second offers. 15 The third offer of compromise, however, is substantially less favourable to Brother than the orders which it in fact obtained.
