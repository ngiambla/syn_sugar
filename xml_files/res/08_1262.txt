 That agreement was to remain in operation for six months from 10 September 2001 16 The plaintiff pleads certain legislative and administrative events of late September and early October 2001; on 27 September 2001, the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001 (Cth) (the Excision Act) came into force.
 The plaintiff contends that it is apparent from documents which have already been disclosed that there were other Australian navy vessels present at the Ashmore Reef Lagoon which may have been available to deliver to mainland Australia those asylum seekers including the plaintiff who, like the plaintiff, were not willing to agree to travel to Christmas Island. 37 The plaintiff also relies on the fact that the roll of rescuees prepared aboard the Arnhem Bay shows the plaintiff to be an unaccompanied minor.
 The defendants point to the fact that the only pleading raised by the plaintiff is not a right to be taken to the Australian mainland but a right not to be removed from Australia and a right not to be taken to a country outside of Australia unless and until matters concerning the IGOC Act were satisfied.
