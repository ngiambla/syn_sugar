 Those Grounds merely set forth the errors alleged to have been committed by the Tribunal. 6 This deficiency in the Notice of Appeal is not a mere matter of form. 7 Division 2 of Part 8 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides for the manner in which decisions may be reviewed by the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court and the High Court.
 Section 476A provides for the limited original jurisdiction to be entertained by this Court: eg, Assad v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039 ; La Bara v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FCA 785 at [3] ; Shuster v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 215 at [6] ---[7], [2008] FCA 215 ; 167 FCR 186 at 188.
 This Court only has the limited original jurisdiction conferred by s 476A of the 1958 Act and, relevantly, the appellate jurisdiction thereafter conferred by s 24(1)(d) of the 1976 Act to entertain an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. 9 The Notice of Appeal identifies no error committed by the Federal Magistrates Court and may be dismissed for that reason.
 Whatever other deficiencies there may be in his Notice of Appeal , that Notice does state (without alteration) that " the appellant appeals from the whole of the judgment of the Federal Magistrate Court given on 18.6.2008 at Sydney ".
