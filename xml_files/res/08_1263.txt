 This Court only has the limited original jurisdiction conferred by s 476A of the 1958 Act and, relevantly, the appellate jurisdiction thereafter conferred by s 24(1)(d) of the 1976 Act to entertain an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. 9 The Notice of Appeal identifies no error committed by the Federal Magistrates Court and may be dismissed for that reason.
 Whatever other deficiencies there may be in his Notice of Appeal , that Notice does state (without alteration) that " the appellant appeals from the whole of the judgment of the Federal Magistrate Court given on 18.6.2008 at Sydney ".
