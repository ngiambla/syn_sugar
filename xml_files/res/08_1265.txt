 LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 5 Section 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Act) provides as follows: The Court or a Judge may, at any stage of a proceeding in the Court, direct that the proceeding or a part of the proceeding be conducted or continued at a place specified in the order, subject to such conditions (if any) as the Court or Judge imposes. 6 The Court is required to be satisfied after considering all the relevant matters that there is sound reason to direct that the proceedings be conducted or continued elsewhere.
 The test which is to be applied requires consideration of where the case can be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all the parties, the ends of justice and the determination of issues between them, and the most efficient administration of the Court: National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation (1988) 19 FCR 155 at 162. 7 In Jacobs v Claudius Enterprises Pty Ltd [1985] ATPR 40-511 , Spender J observed that the following were relevant factors for the Court to consider when deciding whether to change venue: (a) the residence of the parties; (b) the residence of the witnesses for the various parties; (c) the expense and prejudice likely to the respective parties; (d) the likelihood of delay being a significant consideration; (e) whether there is, in respect of the competing suggestions as to venue, any possibility of an interference with a fair trial of the hearing; and (f) the balance of convenience having regard to all considerations. 8 In addition to the Pt IV TPA question there are issues raised concerning restraint of trade at common law and pursuant to the New South Wales Restraints of Trade Act 1976 (NSW).
 They also contend: (a) all the applicant's offices and staff are resident in Western Australia; (b) the applicant provides all services the subject of the subcontract directly to the public of Western Australia; (c) the respondent, although based in Sydney, is a national company with offices and business interests around Australia including a Western Australian head office; (d) the applicant intends that Ms Allen will give evidence at trial and she resides in Western Australia; (e) the applicant's solicitors who have had the conduct of the matter since the commencement of the proceedings are based in Perth; (f) each of the parties have retained experienced counsel in Western Australia who have had the carriage of the matter to date.
 That is not to say that those or other counsel could not appear in the New South Wales District Registry but there would appear to be some additional expenditure involved if there were a change in counsel, were a Western Australian counsel travelling to Sydney; (g) the respondent has been able to conduct the proceedings successfully so far with the use of solicitors both in Perth and in Sydney; (h) The applicant's choice of venue initially which is reflected in the commencement of the proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia is that the proceedings be heard in Western Australia; and (i) Active pursuit of a transfer to the Federal Court was not initiated by the respondent until quite recently. 15 In the end, the issues are fairly finely balanced but for these reasons, I am satisfied that the factors relied upon by the applicant in opposing the change of venue should prevail: (a) The proceedings were reasonably advanced at the time of transfer to this Court.
