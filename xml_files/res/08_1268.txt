 It follows, as Gaudron J said, [2000] HCA 34 ; [(2000) 203 CLR 346 at 375 [83] ; [2000] HCA 34 ; 172 ALR 257 at 275; [2000] HCA 34] that the legislative power conferred by s 51(xx) "extends to laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations". 19 The majority concluded, in [198]: ...
