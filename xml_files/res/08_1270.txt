 His Honour relied upon the decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 , which held that the assessment of the credibility of an applicant is a matter of fact and is a matter solely for the administrative decision maker.
 However, the Court infers from the Tribunal hearing record, which stated that the applicant did not request time to 'comment/respond under ss 359AA/424AA ' , that such discretion was exercised. 25 In considering whether the Tribunal had breached s 424AA , Scarlett FM found that the Tribunal had 'quite clearly' relied upon the appellant's own evidence and its assessment of that evidence and the independent country information.
 Scarlett FM found that as such information did not constitute 'information' for the purposes of s 424A(1) of the Act, it was 'clearly not intended' to be covered by s 424AA of the Act. 26 The Tribunal found that there were inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence.
 Scarlett FM noted that it was well established that inconsistencies in evidence do not constitute 'information' for the purposes of s 424A of the [2007] FCA 26 ; Act (see SZBYR and Another v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [18] ) and accordingly do not constitute 'information' for the purposes of s 424AA.
