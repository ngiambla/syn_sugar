 1 On 20 May 2008, I dismissed an appeal from a judgment of Nicholls FM in SZKNB v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] FMCA 2012. 2 Nicholls FM, on 10 December 2007, dismissed an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal), which had been signed on 22 March 2007 and handed down on 23 March 2007, affirming a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa. 3 I ordered that the appeal be dismissed; the appellant pay the respondents' costs to be taxed, if not agreed, and I indicated that I would deliver reasons for the making of those orders at a later date.
 That decision was affirmed by the Tribunal on 19 May 1999, the decision being handed down on 20 May 1999. 5 It appears that the appellant remained in Australia until his detention in 2006, and the Minister, on 13 December 2006, exercised his power to allow the appellant to make a second application for a protection visa pursuant to s 48B of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act). 6 The appellant applied for a protection visa on 18 December 2006, which was refused by a delegate of the Minister on 8 January 2007.
 Counsel for the appellant was granted leave to file an amended application, in which the appellant claimed that the Tribunal did not comply with s 424A of the Act as the letter sent to the applicant by the Tribunal pursuant to that section was sent after the Tribunal hearing. 10 It was contended for the appellant, on the basis of the remarks made in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 ; [2007] HCA 26 ( SZBYR ) at [17]-[19], that s 424A required a letter to be sent prior to any Tribunal hearing. 11 Nicholls FM dismissed this argument for two reasons.
