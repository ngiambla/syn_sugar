 The invention described and claimed in the complete specification is a class of compounds being antiviral nucleosides for the treatment of viral infections. 5 In its application for an extension of the term of the Patent, Lilly relied upon registrations on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) for the commercial product Gemcitabine hydrochloride.
 The first, by Lilly, seeks an order under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that pars 1 to 6, 8 and 10 of the Amended Application, and pars 7 to 19 of the Amended Statement of Claim be dismissed.
 The applicant alleges that these representations were made in trade and commerce and were false. 12 In Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75 the applicant alleged that Novopharm, in trade or commerce, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent.
 Accordingly, it was said, if there were to be a TGA approval given in late 2008 or early 2009, the earliest time a PBS application could be lodged would be 1 January 2009, and the earliest the Shilpa product would be listed would be 1 April 2009.
