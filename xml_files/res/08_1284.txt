 1 This is an appeal to the Federal Court from the decision of Federal Magistrate Turner in Singh Ors v Minister for Immigration Anor [2007] FMCA 1739 given on 9 November 2007. 2 His Honour found that by operation of s 46 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act), the first appellant could not make a valid application for a Graduate --- Skilled (Class UQ) (Temporary), Subclass 497 visa lodged on 25 March 2002.
 An interpretation which gives operative effect to a provision is to be preferred to one that renders it nugatory, and defeats the intention of the legislature: Anstee v Jennings [1935] VLR 144 per Macfarlan J. 16 Turner FM found that by operation of s 46 of the Act, and as the visa held by the first appellant was subject to a condition described in s 41(2)(a) , which had not been waived by the Minister, the first appellant could not make an application for the visa which she did, and by condition 8534, she could not be granted the visa.
 His Honour concluded that the second Tribunal made no error of law in the conclusions it reached. 17 The Notice of Appeal raises three grounds, namely, that the Federal Magistrate erred in: 1. finding that condition 8534 in Sch 8 of the Migration Regulations was a regulation made pursuant to s 41(2)(a) of the Act; 2. holding that if condition 8534 was not made pursuant to s 41(2)(a), then it would be ineffective and conflict with the intention and purpose of s 41(2)(a); and 3. finding that s 46(1A) precluded the first appellant from applying for a visa.
