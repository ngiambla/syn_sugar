 Hence, the respondents argued that, even if the Court found that Mr Mates had caused the crane from Independent Cranes to shut down and leave the site on 21 February 2006, this conduct alone could not constitute "building industrial action" as defined in s 36(1) of the BCII Act .
 The considerations that informed the introduction of the BCII Act differ to an extent from the historical and policy considerations referred to by Wilcox and Cooper JJ in Davids , and which led their Honours to construe paras (b) and (c) of the definition of "industrial action" in s 4(1) of the WR Act as referring to a limitation on the performance of building work imposed by those to whom the work related. 58 As the second reading speech and REM to the BCII Bill make clear, there is a distinct relationship between the operation of the WR Act and the BCII Act .
 Whatever the position be with respect to the definition of "industrial action" in the WR Act , I am not persuaded that, in the context of the BCII Act , the reference to a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work should be construed as if the Parliament had made this amendment to it.
 That is to say, the ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work to which paras (b) and (c) of the definition of "building industrial action" in s 36(1) of the BCII Act refer is not limited to a prohibition or restriction imposed by employees to whom the work relates and may refer to that which is imposed by a union, such as the CFMEU.
