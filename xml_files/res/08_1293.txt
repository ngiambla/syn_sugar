 The residue of the estate was to be held on trust. 6 The Tribunal held that, by his will, the deceased created two trusts, being a life discretionary trust and a contingent fixed trust, the principal beneficiary of the latter being the Elliotts' daughter, Susan.
 Pursuant to subs 1207V(1), for the purposes of Pt 3.18 , a trust is a "controlled private trust" in relation to an individual if the trust is a "designated private trust" (as defined in subs 1207P(1)) and the individual passes the "control test" in subs 1207V(2) or the "source test" in subs 1207V(3).
 Holding that the provision applied to the relevant person's equitable estate or interest in property the subject of a non-discretionary or fixed trust, his Honour turned to the "less straightforward question ... when the relevant person is a beneficiary of a discretionary trust": see Carey at 515.
