 In that case, the Full Court held that it could refuse to make an order under s 157(2) of the TPA in respect of a document where it considered that the conditions giving rise to legal professional privilege were satisfied in respect of the document or part of it, and privilege was not waived.
 The ACCC submits that amending its pleadings in these ways is appropriate and necessary to establish the ongoing entitlement to injunctive relief and to rebut the defence under s 85(3) of the TPA. 26 The ACCC says that the proposed amendments are also necessary to raise the real questions in issue between the parties, and avoid a multiplicity of proceedings by focussing on the pattern of conduct of Google rather than pursuing each alleged breach separately.
 Google also says that no complaint has been made by any organisation whose name or website address is said to have been used in a misleading way, and that some organisations were only aware of or troubled by the sponsored links when informed by the ACCC.
