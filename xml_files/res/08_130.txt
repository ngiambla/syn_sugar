 In the meantime, ACMA taxed its costs in respect of the action and on 20 September 2007 the Court issued a Certificate of Taxation allowing ACMA's bill of costs of $309,036. 5 ACMA's motion seeking a time limit by which payment of pecuniary penalties must be made was filed on 7 June 2007.
 It has been pointed out by the Court in the course of exchanges during which Mr Mansfield has been present, that the effect of what ACMA seeks is to apply to amend his Honour's orders so as to impose a time limit for compliance with them.
 Accordingly, we will make an order generally in the terms referred to in the last paragraph of the letter set out above. 18 I propose to allow 28 rather than 7 days from the date of service of this judgment and orders for compliance by Mr Mansfield with the order.
