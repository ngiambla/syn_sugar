 Other matters contemplated that the director of the defendant company would pay weekly instalments of $60,000 up to a total amount of $240,000 to the applicant plaintiff. 3 The matter came before the court again on 12 June 2008 and was adjourned until 24 July 2008.
 The arrangements contemplated that periodic payments would continue to be made as outlined in correspondence dated 7 May 2008. 4 The matter came before the court again on 24 July 2008 and arrangements and orders were then made for the filing of affidavits and affidavits in-reply on the question of solvency.
 Section 440A(2) is well known and provides that: The court is to adjourn the hearing of an application for an order to wind up a company if the company is under administration and the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up. 7 The focus of Mr Stimpson's affidavit is to set out facts and circumstances which are said to be persuasive of it being in the interests of creditors that the company continue in voluntary administration rather than being wound up now.
 Mechanisms for compromising claims which might otherwise have been implemented through a voluntary administration earlier in time could have been considered including the possibility of convening of a meeting of creditors with a view to considering, and if thought be appropriate, passing a resolution to adopt a Deed of Company Arrangement.
