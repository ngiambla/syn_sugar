 Leave is necessary because the judgment concerned was interlocutory: s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (" Federal Court of Australia Act "). 2 Mrs Rogers was not legally represented either in the commencement of the proceeding or at any stage thereafter, including her application for leave to appeal. 3 Order 52, r 4 of the Federal Court Rules requires that an application for leave to appeal be in or substantially in Form 54 and that it be accompanied by an affidavit showing: (a) the nature of the case; (b) the questions involved; and (c) the reasons why leave should be given. 4 Mrs Rogers filed an application in the required form, along with an accompanying affidavit sworn by her.
 The borrowings were a sequel to dealings which Mr Rogers had with a broker, Mr Russell Percival, now the Fourth Respondent, and Mr Paul Hare, now the Third Respondent and eventually entities controlled or associated with each of those individuals, including the present First Respondent, Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd ("ALC"), the present Second Respondent, Asset Loan Company Pty Ltd ("ALCPL") and the present Sixth Respondent, Riverstone Nominees Pty Ltd ("Riverstone") as trustee for the Percival Family Trust.
 The monies were secured by, amongst other things, guarantees from Mr Rogers, Mrs Rogers and Ms Braas. 13.07.04 ALCPL, by its solicitors, issued a Letter of Demand to Mr Rogers demanding repayment of his indebtedness to it under his guarantee. 20.07.04 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD136/2004 against the present First to Sixth Respondents.
 Justice Spender declined to reinstate the proceedings. 07.04.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceedings QUD130/2006, relying on virtually identical facts, matters and circumstances as those previously alleged by Mrs Rogers and him in previous matters in the Federal Court. 20.04.06 Justice Greenwood dismissed the application for interlocutory relief and reserved costs in proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2006] FCA 434. 12.10.06 The Respondents in proceeding QUD525/2005 apply for the proceeding to be dismissed or permanently stayed.
 Justice Spender reserved his decision. 07.12.06 Justice Collier dismissed the balance of proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2006] FCA 1708. 15.12.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD504/2006 by way of an appeal against Justice Collier's decision in QUD130/2006. 23.02.07 Matter QUD504/2006 dismissed by Justice Greenwood: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2007] FCA 195. 14.06.07 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD173/2007 against the First to Seventh Respondents, seeking virtually the same relief claimed in proceeding QUD525/2005 (which as at the time remained reserved by Spender J) and relief on the same facts, matters and circumstances. 30.08.07 Justice Spender dismissed proceeding QUD525/2005, with costs.
 Impact of prior proceedings 20 The application which succeeded before her Honour highlighted an identity between paras 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the "Details of claim" and para 2 and para 3 in the "claim for Interlocutory Relief" with the proceeding the subject of the judgment delivered by Spender J in Rogers v Asset Loan Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1371.
 In turn, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the present proceeding has been instituted by Mrs Rogers in an endeavour to resurrect claims which in substance had been dismissed by Spender J. 26 In Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2007] FCA 1371 , at [36] to [48] Spender J summarily stated his conclusions in respect of proceeding QUD525/2005, having regard to earlier and other proceedings which had been filed in this Court and elsewhere by Mrs Rogers or, as the case may be, Mr Rogers.
