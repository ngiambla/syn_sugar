 Justice Spender declined to reinstate the proceedings. 07.04.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceedings QUD130/2006, relying on virtually identical facts, matters and circumstances as those previously alleged by Mrs Rogers and him in previous matters in the Federal Court. 20.04.06 Justice Greenwood dismissed the application for interlocutory relief and reserved costs in proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2006] FCA 434. 12.10.06 The Respondents in proceeding QUD525/2005 apply for the proceeding to be dismissed or permanently stayed.
 Justice Spender reserved his decision. 07.12.06 Justice Collier dismissed the balance of proceeding QUD130/2006: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2006] FCA 1708. 15.12.06 Mr Rogers commenced proceeding QUD504/2006 by way of an appeal against Justice Collier's decision in QUD130/2006. 23.02.07 Matter QUD504/2006 dismissed by Justice Greenwood: Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd Ors [2007] FCA 195. 14.06.07 Mrs Rogers commenced proceeding QUD173/2007 against the First to Seventh Respondents, seeking virtually the same relief claimed in proceeding QUD525/2005 (which as at the time remained reserved by Spender J) and relief on the same facts, matters and circumstances. 30.08.07 Justice Spender dismissed proceeding QUD525/2005, with costs.
 Assuming, somewhat charitably, that the conduct there alleged might conceivably be brought within the embrace of that which is proscribed by the ASIC Act , whatever personal injury in the form of mental injury or distress that Mr Rogers may have suffered has about it an overwhelmingly derivative or consequential quality in relation to the conduct and resulting loss and damage there alleged. 37 Further, the alleged effect of that conduct on Mr Rogers' mental health is not said discretely to be referable to any one alleged event or particular alleged conduct.
 Though the effect, if any, of O 21 r 3 with respect to the practice and procedure in respect of seeking to engage the powers conferred by O 21 r 1 and r 2 is not mentioned in that case, neither it must be said, is it mentioned in Ramsey v Skyring, National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) and Granich and Associates v Yap . 55 In these circumstances it seems to me that I ought to consider whether, assuming that my interpretation of O 21 r 3 is wrong, the outcome of the Respondents' summary judgment application in this proceeding warrants the making of the orders sought under O 21 r 1 and r 2 in the circumstances. 56 It is certainly possible to see in the course and outcomes of litigation described in the above chronology why the Respondents feel disposed to seek orders under O 21, r 1 and r 2.
