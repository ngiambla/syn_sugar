 Subcategory E(3) 49 This subcategory includes those who wrote or sent an email to Maurice Blackburn alleging that they did not receive the Identification Notice before 24 June but did not provide a statutory declaration or include any documents or independent evidence to support this claim.
 As I have previously indicated, this is an understandable but insufficient reason for failing to comply with the deadline and these members should not be included. 70 There are two members of this subcategory whose explanations for delay warrant some additional mention.
