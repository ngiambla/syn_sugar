 1 On 17 April 2008 I made orders dismissing an application by the University of Western Australia (UWA) against Dr Bruce Gray and Sirtex Medical Limited (Sirtex), the public company which held intellectual property developed by Dr Gray and others.
 The second respondent's cross-claim against the first respondent stand over for a directions hearing for directions as to an assessment of damages based upon the first respondent's breach of his duty as a director of the second respondent and for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA) arising out of his non-disclosure to the second respondent of correspondence between himself and the Vice-Chancellor of the applicant in 1999. 10.
 The assessment of loss and the identification of heads of loss in connection with Sirtex successful cross-claim against Dr Gray are clearly closely related and there is a risk that by formulating heads of damage with any useful precision, whether by way of ruling or in a declaration, I would do so in a way that could unnecessarily confine the assessment process. 4 The test, as I think counsel for Sirtex Mr Elliott accepted, must always remain one of causal connection in terms of s 79 of the Fair Trading Act .
 For those reasons I am not prepared to either make the declarations which are sought or to make rulings as to heads of loss and will adjourn the matter or assessment of damages by another judge in due course. 8 The orders I will make are: 1.
