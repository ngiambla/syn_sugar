 He has not taken out Thai citizenship and is permitted to live in Thailand by reason of a business visa which is issued 12 monthly. 14 The purpose of Mr Foster's absence of [sic] Australia is not to be near or with family members --- because they all live in Australia.
 But Mr Foster, fortunately, is not terminally ill within any reasonable construction of that term, nor is his purpose of being in Thailand to be with or near a family member, or to return to his country of origin.
 I have to apply the law as it is, sympathetic though I am to Mr Foster's plight. 9 For these reasons, the application for extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal will be refused.
