 The appellant claimed that Babakham threatened him, warned him not to discipline Faruq again, beat him with a wooden rod and caused threats to be made to his wife concerning her safety and the safety of his children.
 The independent country information suggested to the Tribunal that perhaps Hindus in Gujarat might not have a basis for a fear of serious harm as compared with a fear which might be held by members of the Muslim faith.
 Secondly, the Tribunal noted the travel to overseas countries by the appellant on 6 September 2006, his failure to seek asylum in those countries or contact foreign diplomatic missions or United Nations representatives to agitate his concern about a fear of serious harm.
 Rather, the appellant elected to return to his home village where the source of the harm arose. 24 The Tribunal reached these conclusions. 25 First, the Tribunal accepted that the appellant had suffered some damage during the 2002 riots and had developed an enmity with Babakham.
