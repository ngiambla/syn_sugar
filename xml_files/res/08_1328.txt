 In his application the Liquidator seeks a direction that he is justified in taking his costs of this application, and his costs, remuneration and expenses (properly and reasonably incurred) of and incidental to work carried out in relation to the sum of $60,000.00 set aside by the Liquidator in accordance with clause 9 of the Deed, prior to any distribution of that sum or any part of it. 16 There is no doubt that the Liquidator is so justified.
 In an affidavit sworn on 22 August 2008 the Liquidator deposed that there is due to the firm of Chartered Accountants of which he is a member the sum of approximately $3,782 (excluding GST) for work carried out in connection with the Deed from 10 December 2007 to 22 August 2008 inclusive.
