 He made some allegations against Mr White which are unsubstantiated but are in any event irrelevant to the issue now before this Court. 14 Mr Diprose pointed to s 199A(3) of the Corporations Act which prohibits a company from indemnifying a person against legal costs incurred in defending an action for a liability incurred as an officer of the company in certain circumstances, including (par (b)) in defending or resisting criminal proceedings in which the person is found guilty.
 In his application the Liquidator seeks a direction that he is justified in taking his costs of this application, and his costs, remuneration and expenses (properly and reasonably incurred) of and incidental to work carried out in relation to the sum of $60,000.00 set aside by the Liquidator in accordance with clause 9 of the Deed, prior to any distribution of that sum or any part of it. 16 There is no doubt that the Liquidator is so justified.
 In an affidavit sworn on 22 August 2008 the Liquidator deposed that there is due to the firm of Chartered Accountants of which he is a member the sum of approximately $3,782 (excluding GST) for work carried out in connection with the Deed from 10 December 2007 to 22 August 2008 inclusive.
 However, the Liquidator goes on to say that the sum of approximately $40,000 (including GST) "is attributed to such work carried out by my solicitors and Counsel" over the same period. 18 In an earlier affidavit sworn on 29 May 2008 the Liquidator attributes $6,939.59 (excluding GST) to work in connection with the Deed carried out by his solicitors from 10 December 2007 to 21 April 2008.
