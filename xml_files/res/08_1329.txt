 His Honour's orders result in important consequences for the parties, even though, as Mr Rebikoff for the respondents pointed out, they do not determine substantive rights. 8 Mr Rebikoff argued that the only prejudice alleged by the applicant was the cost of the US proceeding.
 Sundberg J's judgment deals with substantial legal issues which are appropriate for resolution by a Full Court. 13 Experience shows that, in cases like the present one, it is not really practicable to separate out the leave issue of whether there the decision below is "attended with sufficient doubt" from the substantive merits.
 Alternatively, and still less is this the subject of any promise, a Full Court might be convened before November. 16 If the application for leave were to be heard before a single judge, the hearing may not occur immediately and the judge might have to reserve his or her decision.
 While of course if leave were refused that would be the end of the matter, if leave were granted the passage of time may have made it impossible to secure a hearing date for the appeal in the November sittings or earlier.
