 The Federal Magistrate further stated that the Tribunal was not required to notify the appellant of its subjective thought processes or appraisals of evidence. 12 In relation to the one-child policy the Federal Magistrate stated that the Tribunal did not in fact reach any conclusion as to whether the policy was a law of general application.
 Section 424AA provides a new discretion for the RRT to orally give information and invite an applicant to comment on or respond to the information at the time that the applicant is appearing before the RRT in response to an invitation issued under section 425.
 The corollary is that if the RRT does give clear particulars of the information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under section 424AA , it is not required to give the particulars under section 424A. 20 The appellant has not particularised the alleged breach of s 424AA.
 The Tribunal stated, purportedly applying s 91R(3) , that it disregarded the appellant's conduct in Australia in acquiring knowledge about Christianity as well as his church attendance in assessing whether he had a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason should he return to China then or in the foreseeable future.
