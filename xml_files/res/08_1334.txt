 The Tribunal therefore considered that, for the Visa Applicant to be a highly skilled person, she must have completed experience equivalent to three years of formal training. 13 In that regard, the Tribunal had regard to the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations , which is published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics ( the ASCO Dictionary ).
 The ASCO Dictionary also sets out the tasks that would be performed by a sales and marketing manager. 14 The Tribunal examined the evidence before it as to the qualifications and work experience of the Visa Applicant.
 The Visa Applicant said that the Tribunal erred in taking the view that any experience that was not at the level of a fully qualified sales and marketing manager was not comparable to undertaking formal training.
 Thus, it was not part of the function of the Tribunal, in reviewing the application by the Visa Applicant, to consider whether or not the position of sales and marketing manager in the business of the Employer was exceptional.
