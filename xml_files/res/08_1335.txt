 It is argued that on a proper construction of the Act and Treaty, the decree did not have retrospective effect, and her Honour should have made an order dismissing the application for surrender for extradition. 4 It is not possible to evaluate in any detail the merits of that ground of review because there is no record of the decision available at present.
 Counsel for the Republic of Hungary, Mr Renton, has informed me that the Republic does not oppose bail being granted if I am satisfied that there are special circumstances in existence, and further that it would not, at this stage, take a position opposing the foreshadowed basis of the grounds of review. 5 In relation to 'special circumstances', under the Act, the High Court of Australia has dealt with this topic extensively in United Mexican States v Cabal [2001] HCA 61 ; (2001) 209 CLR 165.
