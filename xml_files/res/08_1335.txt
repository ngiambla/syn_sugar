 That section provides that where a magistrate of a State or Territory makes an order pursuant s 19(9) in relation to a person whose surrender is sought by an extradition country, the person may, within 15 days after the day on which the magistrate makes the order, apply to the Federal Court of Australia or to the Supreme Court of the State or Territory for a review of the order. 3 By the specific subparagraph relied upon today, if there are 'special circumstances' justifying such a course, the Court may order the release, on bail, of the person on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit, until the review has been conducted or the appeal has been heard.
 It is argued that on a proper construction of the Act and Treaty, the decree did not have retrospective effect, and her Honour should have made an order dismissing the application for surrender for extradition. 4 It is not possible to evaluate in any detail the merits of that ground of review because there is no record of the decision available at present.
 Counsel for the Republic of Hungary, Mr Renton, has informed me that the Republic does not oppose bail being granted if I am satisfied that there are special circumstances in existence, and further that it would not, at this stage, take a position opposing the foreshadowed basis of the grounds of review. 5 In relation to 'special circumstances', under the Act, the High Court of Australia has dealt with this topic extensively in United Mexican States v Cabal [2001] HCA 61 ; (2001) 209 CLR 165.
 He has no close relatives or friends living outside of Australia and, significantly, his health, due to his age and his health condition generally, prevents him from leaving Perth as he is required to attend various medical appointments to monitor his health. 7 In that regard, I have been supplied with a report by Dr Ian Guy dated 19 August 2008 in which Dr Guy gives a brief account of the medical history for the applicant.
