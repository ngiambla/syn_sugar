 The affidavit was sworn in connection with an interlocutory dispute between the applicant and the Commission concerning discovery by the Commission in relation to the Commission's allegations that the disputed documents were not the subject of legal professional privilege because they had been brought into existence in the furtherance of fraud or the commission of an offence.
 The solicitor prepared and filed affidavits and exhibits to affidavits on the basis of his assumption that the prospect of orders being made under s 50 in respect of such material would be maximised if the Commission did not change its position of either supporting or not opposing the making of such orders.
 The question is whether, once material has been introduced into evidence, it is necessary, in order to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice, that that material not be made available to the public. 62 The applicant has not adduced evidence that any specific damage or prejudice would be occasioned or might be occasioned by the disclosure of the material in question.
