 It is sufficient for me in these reasons to refer to the case of the first appellant and, for ease of reference, I will refer to him simply as the appellant. 3 On 23 November 2003 a delegate of the Minister refused the appellant's application for a protection visa.
 The Tribunal is not satisfied that these issues have any significance in accounting for lack of detail or for inconsistencies in evidence in the present case. 7 As I have said, this appeal lies from orders made by a Federal Magistrate.
