 The letter advised that in view of Mr Godfrey's appointment the DCT would seek to have the application dismissed with an order for costs. 28 By the time of the return date on 13 June 2008, it was appreciated by the ATO that s 490 of the Act had the effect that the Company had not been able to resolve that it be wound up voluntarily because the application for it to be wound up in insolvency had been filed.
 Ms Chan wrote to Mr Godfrey on 16 June 2008 a letter advising of the adjournment and noting that under s 490(a) of the Act, the appointment of Mr Godfrey as liquidator on 19 May 2008 had been invalid. 30 I noted at [2] above, the orders made by the Deputy Registrar on 27 June 2008. 31 On 4 July 2008, Mr Godfrey filed a notice of motion seeking review of the Deputy Registrar's decision of 27 June 2008, and on 10 July 2008 he filed an amended notice of motion seeking that relief but in the alternative an order pursuant to s 490 or in the alternative s 1322(4) of the Act, nunc pro tunc , granting leave for the Company to be wound up and for Mr Godfrey to be liquidator "pursuant to the resolution of (a) [t]he members of the [Company] on 19 May 2008; and (b) [t]he creditors of the [Company] on 29 May 2008".
 Yet neither of them pursued with Mr Cadorin the question whether the Company had been served with a winding up application. 36 The Company would have received the originating process shortly after 19 May 2008, admittedly after the passing of the members' resolution, but well before the holding of the creditors' meeting on 29 May 2008.
