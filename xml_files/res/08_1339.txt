 The letter advised that in view of Mr Godfrey's appointment the DCT would seek to have the application dismissed with an order for costs. 28 By the time of the return date on 13 June 2008, it was appreciated by the ATO that s 490 of the Act had the effect that the Company had not been able to resolve that it be wound up voluntarily because the application for it to be wound up in insolvency had been filed.
 Yet neither of them pursued with Mr Cadorin the question whether the Company had been served with a winding up application. 36 The Company would have received the originating process shortly after 19 May 2008, admittedly after the passing of the members' resolution, but well before the holding of the creditors' meeting on 29 May 2008.
