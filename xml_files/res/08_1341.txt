 Pursuant to the Court's broad discretion as to costs, and following the general principle that costs follow the event, I ordered that the applicant pay the costs of the respondents. 2 Subsequent to delivery of that judgment, the first respondent made an application seeking costs from the applicant on an indemnity basis.
 I granted the applicant and first respondent some time to file and serve submissions as to whether the applicant should pay indemnity costs to the first respondent. 3 The applicant submits that it should not have to pay the costs of the first respondent on an indemnity basis.
