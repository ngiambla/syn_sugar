 Pursuant to the Court's broad discretion as to costs, and following the general principle that costs follow the event, I ordered that the applicant pay the costs of the respondents. 2 Subsequent to delivery of that judgment, the first respondent made an application seeking costs from the applicant on an indemnity basis.
 I granted the applicant and first respondent some time to file and serve submissions as to whether the applicant should pay indemnity costs to the first respondent. 3 The applicant submits that it should not have to pay the costs of the first respondent on an indemnity basis.
 In the present circumstances --- having regard to s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), O 23 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules , and the relevant authorities on this point (see Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 ; Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Limited [2003] FCAFC 1 ; Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 126) --- I am of the view that making the orders sought by the first respondent is appropriate. 7 Accordingly, I order that: (i) the applicant pay the costs of the first respondent on a solicitor/client basis as taxed or agreed from and including the date of 29 April 2008; (ii) the applicant pay the costs of the first respondent on a party/party basis as taxed or agreed up to and including the date of 28 April 2008; (iii) the applicant pay the costs of the second respondent on a party/party basis as taxed or agreed; and (iv) the applicant pay the costs of the respondents of this costs application on a party/party basis as taxed or agreed.
