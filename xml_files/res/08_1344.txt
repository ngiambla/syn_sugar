 The Applicants did not appear before the Tribunal and the Tribunal proceeded to resolve the application pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). 3 An amended application as filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 19 May 2008 contended that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 425 of the 1958 Act.
 The " lawyer ", however, was someone he had never met, but a person to whom a " fee " was apparently paid. 11 Without more, such is not considered to be a satisfactory explanation for the delay.
 It is, at the very least, invidious that a person professing to be a legal practitioner accepts a " fee " for professing to advise persons such as the present Applicants but a person who apparently has never seen the Applicants. 12 There is, in any event, no reason to question the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court.
