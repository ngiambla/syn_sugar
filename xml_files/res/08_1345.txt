 Notwithstanding that, Mr Cook indicated that he was not available for a telephone direction hearing in relation to Mr Wearne's evidence, and that travelling into Melbourne for AAT hearings was difficult, and he did not want a directions hearing.
 Mr Cook was not available on 16 May 2005 at 2.30pm by telephone, despite efforts by my associate to contact him, and despite he having advised by a fax of 12 May 2005 that he would be available for that telephone directions hearing.
 That telephone directions hearing was held with counsel for the respondent, and I decided on that occasion that the matter would remain listed for 21, 23 and 26 June, and that information was conveyed to Mr Cook by a facsimile of 16 May 2005.
