 The applicant/cross-respondent then purported to amend the application by seeking the following relief: "A declaration that the pending Australian trade marks applications referred to in paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14A and 14B of the accompanying statement of claim are not registrable by the Respondent as trade marks under the Trade Marks Act . " 3 Paragraphs 7---14 of the statement of claim had referred to a series of applications on the part of the respondent/cross-claimant for the registration of various trade marks consisting of or including the word "BAREFOOT" in relation to various goods, including beers and alcoholic beverages apart from wines.
 Paragraph 20 was added to the statement of claim as follows: "At all relevant times the marks the subject of the Australian trade marks applications specified in paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14A and 14B were and are not registrable by the Respondent as trade marks under the Trade Marks Act .
 It may be accepted that it will be a rare case where the court finds it appropriate to grant declaratory relief in relation to a pending trade mark application rather than allow the procedure under the Act to take its course.
 The paragraphs of the statement of claim which refer to the respondent/cross-claimant's applications have, in effect, been superseded by events, as the respondent/cross-claimant is now "on the market" with beer being sold in connection with the mark "BAREFOOT".
