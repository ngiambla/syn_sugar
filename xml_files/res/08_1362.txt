 Note: A body corporate may appoint a representative to exercise the powers that the body corporate may exercise as the member's proxy, see section 250D. (2) The appointment may specify the proportion or number of votes that the proxy may exercise. (3) Each member may appoint a proxy.
 An appointment may be a standing one. (1A) The regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) may prescribe different requirements for the authentication of an appointment given to the company by different means (electronic or otherwise). (2) If a company has a constitution, the constitution may provide that an appointment is valid even if it contains only some of the information required by subsection (1). (3) An undated appointment is taken to have been dated on the day it is given to the company. (4) An appointment may specify the way the proxy is to vote on a particular resolution.
 Documents received following adjournment of meeting (2) If a meeting of a company's members has been adjourned, an appointment and any authority received by the company at least 48 hours before the resumption of the meeting are effective for the resumed part of the meeting.
 In this case, neither the constitutions nor the notices reduced the 48 hour period. 33 Section 250BA of the Act imposes a requirement for a listed company to specify in the notice a place and a facsimile number and an electronic address for listed companies.
