 The period commences: (a) if the person was in Australia immediately before the person commenced the journey to Vietnam --- on and from the date of the last port of call in Australia; or (b) if the person was outside Australia immediately before the person commenced the journey to Vietnam --- on and from the date that the person left that place outside Australia. 2.
 The period ends: (a) if, immediately after the person left Vietnam, the person journeyed to a place outside Australia to perform duty not associated with a continuing journey to Australia --- on the day that the person arrived at that other place outside Australia; or (b) in any other case --- on the day that the person arrived at the first port of call in Australia.
 QUESTION 1 7 It is implicit in the first of the questions of law identified in the notice of appeal that the Tribunal construed s 6C of the Act and the instrument as precluding a finding that a veteran had operational service if the specific date or dates of that service were not established or if that service was not confirmed by service records or both.
 However we do not have a date on which to consider operational service, and we were satisfied from the thorough Brennan search of the records that Mr Kaluza was not recorded as having been on an operational flight in early 1968. 9 However, a fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons for decision as a whole, so far as they deal with Mr Kaluza's operational service, does not suggest that it proceeded on the basis that it was precluded from finding that Mr Kaluza had operational service if the specific dates of that service were not established.
