 I had also previously, on 13 May 2008, declined to make any order on the applicants' motion of 29 April 2008 for an interlocutory order restraining the second respondent from further evacuating the upstream and downstream ends of the McArthur River diversion channel and associated orders (the applicants' motion): Lansen v Commonwealth Minister for Environment and Heritage (No 2) [2008] FCA 909.
 The first respondent (the Minister) seeks an order for costs of the proceeding against the applicants, save for the costs of the applicants' motion which did not directly concern the second respondent. (The Minister was represented by counsel at the hearing of the applicants' motion but does not seek costs for that attendance. ) 3.
 However, I have come to the firm view, for the reasons I have given, that it is not appropriate to order the NLC to pay costs of the proceedings to MRM, assuming I make an order for costs of the proceedings in its favour against the Lansen applicants.
