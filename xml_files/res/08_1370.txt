 The IAC Lease is further expressed not to have any extinguishing effect on the native title rights and interests of those Aboriginal people. 4 The second lease over the Park between the Minister for Environment and Planning and Driveline Pty Ltd dated 1 July 1989 ("the Mount Dare Lease") is over the area of land in and about Mt Dare Homestead as described in that lease.
 That application (the Irrwanyere Mt Dare claim) was filed on 30 March 2005 and was made specifically for the purpose of securing rights under section 47A of the NTA (the lease was at the time held by the ILC). 12 As a result of the above events, the parties in each of the four claims were able to come to an agreement, and now seek a determination of native title over the Park, by consent.
