 INTRODUCTION 1 On 2 July 2008, I delivered reasons for judgment upholding the applicants' claim for infringement of copyright in 800 questions and answers in practice exams that MedEntry, a business operated by the applicants, sold as part of a preparation course for the Undergraduate Medicine Health Sciences Admission Test ("UMAT") and dismissing the cross-claimants' cross-claim.
 In reasons for judgment delivered on 2 July 2008, I found that the applicants owned the copyright in the works in suit and that, by virtue of s 116 , the infringing copies created by the respondents were to be treated as the property of the applicants.
