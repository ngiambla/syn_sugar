 An exchange between me and senior counsel for Dr Wenkart, Mr Sheahan SC, on 12 November 2007 indicates that, at least at that time, Dr Wenkart was not challenging the power of the Court to find that Mr Pantzer's entitlement to relief was established by reference to events that occurred after the date of the filing of his cross-claim.
 His Honour's intention can be ascertained by reference to the transcript of the hearing before him. 29 For the above reasons I do not consider it appropriate to withdraw and reconsider [56]-[91] of the reasons for judgment of 11 April 2008 or to give Mr Pantzer leave to re-open his case to tender further evidence.
