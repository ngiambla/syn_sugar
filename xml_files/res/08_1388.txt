 The judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court 9 The learned federal magistrate identified five grounds on which the appellant claimed to rely in his original application to that court, and a further two grounds from his amended application.
 The appellant was inviting the Tribunal to accept that the information in his application for a business visa was untrue, and to accept that the information in his application for a protection visa was true. 16 As a matter of logic, if the Tribunal had accepted as true the information in the application for a business visa, it would have had to regard much of what the appellant said in his application for a protection visa as untrue, because of the inconsistencies between the two.
 The passage in the Tribunal's reasons describing what happened in the course of the appellant's evidence does not suggest that the appellant was entirely ignorant about the matters the Tribunal was asking about.
 The Tribunal's conclusion that the appellant did not have the political knowledge that could be expected from a person making his claims is based on false reasoning. 19 The next element in the chain of reasoning concerned inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence in relation to his surname.
