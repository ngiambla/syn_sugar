 At the meeting Mr Smith noted that the Company's main assets were the former Kenmore Hospital site and adjacent land located at Goulburn in New South Wales. 4 On 11 June 2008 the Administrators, pursuant to s 439A of the Act , sent a report to the creditors of the Company and notified them of the second meeting of creditors to be held on 18 June 2008.
 Counsel for the plaintiff qualified this proposition by submitting that an assignment of a debt after the date upon which notices were sent out convening the meeting pursuant to s 439A of the Act would be effective to carry with it a right in the assignee to lodge a proof of debt and vote at the meeting so long as the assignment was bona fide and not effected for the purpose of manipulating the voting at the meeting.
 The Administrators' concerns included the history of the land which involved issues of contamination, heritage issues and costs of remediation and also the history of past sale efforts. 51 Further, as noted above, the Administrators had identified in their report significant disadvantages of liquidation. 52 All these factors were matters which the creditors were entitled to take into account in determining whether to vote for the Deed proposed by Mr Byrnes or have the Company go into liquidation.
