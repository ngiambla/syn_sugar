 The first applicant's notices of objection bear an expiry date of 11 August 2011. 5 On 18 July 2008 the Australian Customs Service gave the first applicant (via its solicitors as the person who lodged the notices of objection) notice of the seizure of a commercial consignment of 1180 Minnie Mouse tops under s 133 of the Act.
 Section 137(5) provides as follows: (5) If, after 20 working days from the day on which the action was brought, there is not in force at any time an order of the court directed at the Customs CEO preventing the goods from being released, the Customs CEO must release the goods to their designated owner. 10 Section 137(4) is also relevant.
 The solicitors for the applicants served the notice of motion and Ms Gay's first affidavit on the first respondent at its registered office by registered post and by facsimile. 13 On 4 September 2008 Ms Gay received a telephone call from Mr Ian Richards, who identified himself as the financial controller of the first respondent.
