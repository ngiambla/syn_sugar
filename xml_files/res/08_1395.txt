 There is a question, however, as to whether a reasonable time has elapsed, so as to permit the proceeding to go ahead this morning in any event. 4 At 9.29 am today, there arrived on the facsimile machine in my chambers minutes of order proposed by consent of the parties.
 The effect of the further amendments proposed by the applicant is to eliminate, perhaps altogether, the federal elements of the claim, and to focus, largely, on points of construction in relation to the licence agreement that is the subject of the proceeding.
 The amounts of money spent in the preparation of this proceeding for trial have far exceeded what ought to have been spent, and the transfer of the matter to another court, effectively with a new start in relation to pleadings, is something that I am very reluctant to do.
 In the circumstances, I think I should accede to the parties' agreed desire that the transfer should be to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. 9 On looking closely at the terms of the orders sought, I have some difficulty with those relating to costs.
