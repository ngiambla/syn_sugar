 It provides, relevantly, for the Court, in such an application as this, to make orders, where property has been or is to be transferred from, in this case, the plaintiff, to Buru Energy Ltd ("Buru").
 Arc opposes the making of those orders. 3 On Friday, 1 August 2008, Oil Basins served a writ on Arc concerning an alleged breach of obligations relating to a confidentiality and non-circumvention agreement signed by Arc in November 2006 in relation to the Canning Basin oil permits.
 If the resolutions under consideration today are passed by shareholders and the Court approves the Scheme, responsibility for Oil Basins' claim would be transferred to Buru. 6 The meeting voted overwhelmingly in favour of the scheme.
