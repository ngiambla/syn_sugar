 It provides, relevantly, for the Court, in such an application as this, to make orders, where property has been or is to be transferred from, in this case, the plaintiff, to Buru Energy Ltd ("Buru").
 Arc opposes the making of those orders. 3 On Friday, 1 August 2008, Oil Basins served a writ on Arc concerning an alleged breach of obligations relating to a confidentiality and non-circumvention agreement signed by Arc in November 2006 in relation to the Canning Basin oil permits.
 The writ contained a general endorsement that does not disclose what the confidential information is or how the so-called breach of the circumvention clause occurred, beyond the assertion that it occurred when Arc made and completed negotiations to purchase from Golden Dynasty the shares it held in a company called Terratek Drilling Tools Pty Ltd ("Terratek").
 If the resolutions under consideration today are passed by shareholders and the Court approves the Scheme, responsibility for Oil Basins' claim would be transferred to Buru. 6 The meeting voted overwhelmingly in favour of the scheme.
