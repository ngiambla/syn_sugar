 INTRODUCTION 1 On 29 September 2006, pursuant to s 206F(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act "), a delegate of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") disqualified the respondent, Antonio Murdaca ("Murdaca"), from managing corporations for two years ("the disqualification").
 As with AAMIC, the significance to be attached to Murdaca's conduct in relation to Delitat or TMVP in the context of the making of a disqualification order is ultimately a matter for the AAT when the matter is remitted to it to be determined according to law.
 Murdaca submitted that because the notice listed three companies (see [3] above) and did not refer to Delitat and TMVP, it was not open to the AAT to have regard to these two latter corporations for some, if not all, purposes.
 As noted earlier (see [17]), s 206F has a structural logic and operation pursuant to which the jurisdictional analysis and merits analysis are separate. 43 Section 206F(1)(a) provides the filter --- if a person has been an officer of two or more corporations within the last seven years where the liquidator of each company has filed a s 533 report - then ASIC is entitled to serve a notice on that person requiring them to demonstrate why they should not be disqualified.
