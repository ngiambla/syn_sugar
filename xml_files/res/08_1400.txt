 Stating the matter very briefly; the University alleged that in 1997 Dr Gray, who was until March 1997 a professor and full-time employee of the University, and who until 1999 was employed by the University on a fractional appointment, assigned to the second respondent (Sirtex), a public company, intellectual property rights in micro sphere technologies used in the treatment of liver cancer.
 Before the transfer of those shares Dr Gray had a relevant interest in 17,522,283 shares in Sirtex --- comprising the 16,462,283 shares held in his own name and 1,060,000 shares held by companies in which Dr Gray has a relevant interest. 5 On 5 September 2008, the University sought an undertaking from Dr Gray not to dispose of the shares in ACN and the cash proceeds from the sale of the shares to ACN, and an undertaking from ACN not to dispose of the shares in Sirtex.
 Zelling AJ rejected the contention that there was a general restriction on the power of courts to allow amendments of pleadings after judgment. 10 Further, in the case of Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1335 , Lander J gave leave to the applicants to amend their statement of claim after he had delivered reasons for judgment but before the judgment was entered.
 Lander J allowed the amendment on the basis that the respondents had always been on notice of the applicants' claim for loss and damage in the manner contemplated by the proposed amendment, that the trial had been conducted on that basis and that justice required that he allow the proposed amendment. 11 Also, it is not uncommon for the Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to permit an amendment to be made to the pleadings in the course of an appeal. 12 However, in my view, the position in this case is distinguishable from those referred to above.
 A construction of the Rules which would permit amendment in those circumstances would be inconsistent with the finality principle and the principle that an appeal in this Court is by way of a rehearing directed at correcting error. (See Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 432-440. ) The policy considerations militating against the University's contention are expressed in the following observations of Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7: It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at trial.
 If it were not so the main arena for settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish. 14 It follows, that in my view, the process adopted by the University in seeking to obtain relief against ACN in respect of the events of 27 August 2008 by the amendment of the originating application is not permitted by the Rules.
