 Stating the matter very briefly; the University alleged that in 1997 Dr Gray, who was until March 1997 a professor and full-time employee of the University, and who until 1999 was employed by the University on a fractional appointment, assigned to the second respondent (Sirtex), a public company, intellectual property rights in micro sphere technologies used in the treatment of liver cancer.
 The University claims that the micro sphere technologies were developed whilst Dr Gray was employed by the University, that the intellectual property rights in the invention belonged to the University and that, consequently, the shares issued to Dr Gray in Sirtex are held on trust by him for the University. 2 On 17 April 2008, following a trial lasting some 50 days, French J delivered judgment in the proceeding.
 Zelling AJ rejected the contention that there was a general restriction on the power of courts to allow amendments of pleadings after judgment. 10 Further, in the case of Genocanna Nominees Pty Ltd v Thirsty Point Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1335 , Lander J gave leave to the applicants to amend their statement of claim after he had delivered reasons for judgment but before the judgment was entered.
