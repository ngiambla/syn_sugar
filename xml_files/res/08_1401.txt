 As noted earlier, Asciano accepts that the first three items - air-conditioning, heating and lighting - are constrained by the phrase "in or on a rail vehicle"; if "any purpose" is merely the fourth item in that same list, it follows that it must also be so constrained. 10 For those reasons, I do not consider the language of s 38(5) to be ambiguous when considered on its own.
 It is clear in the way that the phrase "in or on a vessel" has been given its own subparagraph 6(a), joined by means of the conjunctive "and", that the constraint applies to both the "air-conditioning, heating, lighting" limb and the "for any purpose" limb. 21 Unsurprisingly, however, there is an equally plausible alternative construction open.
