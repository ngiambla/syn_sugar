 As noted earlier, Asciano accepts that the first three items - air-conditioning, heating and lighting - are constrained by the phrase "in or on a rail vehicle"; if "any purpose" is merely the fourth item in that same list, it follows that it must also be so constrained. 10 For those reasons, I do not consider the language of s 38(5) to be ambiguous when considered on its own.
 It is clear in the way that the phrase "in or on a vessel" has been given its own subparagraph 6(a), joined by means of the conjunctive "and", that the constraint applies to both the "air-conditioning, heating, lighting" limb and the "for any purpose" limb. 21 Unsurprisingly, however, there is an equally plausible alternative construction open.
 In this case, for example, the Commissioner submits that had Parliament wished to include off-rail activities it could and would have done so clearly by breaking the body of s 38(5) into two separate subclauses, such as: Use in equipment: (a) in or on a rail vehicle for air-conditioning, heating, or lighting; or (b) for any purpose incidental to using the rail vehicle: (i) in rail transport; or (ii) for any of the purposes mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) to (f); or (iii) as mentioned in subsection (4); is use in rail transport . 22 This kind of argument (i.e. "Parliament knew how to draft, and could have drafted, the provision differently if it wished to clearly include (or exclude) something"), regardless of which side advances it, is of little assistance on its own.
