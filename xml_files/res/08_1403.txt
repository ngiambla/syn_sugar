 It is this assertion which was the springboard for the contention that s 80 guaranteed the Applicant a right to trial by jury. 21 Section 80 , it may readily be accepted, " lays down ... a fundamental law of the Commonwealth ": R v Snow [1915] HCA 90 ; (1915) 20 CLR 315 at 323 per Griffith CJ.
 Writing extra-judicially, Justice Kirby has commented that the " significance of the Australian guarantee has been diminished by the narrow interpretation applied to its language ": ' The High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of the United States -- A Centenary Reflection ' (2003) 31 UWAL Rev 171 at 180.
 On behalf of the Applicant it was further contended that the Motion should not be resolved with any " predisposition " against the appointment of a jury; the common law, it was suggested, favoured the resolution of disputed questions of fact being resolved by a jury. 31 It was further contended that the Bankruptcy Act itself, in particular s 31 , provided a basis upon which a legislative intent could be discerned favouring the resolution of questions of fact being undertaken by a jury. 32 Rather than supporting the conclusion being sought by the Applicant, it is considered that the provisions of both the Federal Court of Australia Act and the Bankruptcy Act -- and the authorities which have previously considered those provisions -- strongly support the rejection of the relief sought in the present Motion in the exercise of the Court's discretion .
 The same discretionary reasons which have been relied upon to refuse the relief sought in the Motion , if the provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act were invoked, are also relied upon when considering the discretionary power conferred by s 30(3). 58 There nevertheless remains a difference in the statutory language employed in the 1966 Act and the 1976 Act.
