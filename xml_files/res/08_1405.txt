 The applicant stated that she had planted sweet potatoes approximately 5 centimetres apart, whereas the Tribunal, apparently relying upon a book by Alan Searle [sic], entitled "Growing Vegetables" [CB 74-75] asserted that a farmer in China would plant sweet potatoes 18 inches apart.
 The applicant responded in her statutory declaration that she did in fact plant the sweet potatoes between 15 and 18 inches apart and she did not know the exact meaning of a centimetre.
 The Tribunal was not obliged to either specify, or to provide to the appellant, the particular source documents relied on: see NAVM v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 99 at [32] - [33] . 8.
 There is nothing in that decision which might have alerted the appellant to the possibility that such a publication might be used to test her claims about farming practices in China (cf SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152).
