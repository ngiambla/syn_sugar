 Mr Jessup made reference in his response to Mr Livadaras that Collinsville may arguably be a person with whom AOL was acting or proposing to act in relation to whether or not AOL would remain the responsible entity of the particular project.
 Mr Livadaras said that he had made several attempts in August and September to gain access to the registers for Projects 4, 5 and 6 and that AOL had prevented Mr Livadaras from gaining access to registers of members during September, October and November of 2007 leading up to the meetings of December 2007.
 Mr Livadaras said that he took advice from Mr Jessup about aspects of the notices convening the meetings. 93 Mr Livadaras expressed surprise that AOL had not informed the members of Project 4 of the sale to TOG on 7 December 2007.
