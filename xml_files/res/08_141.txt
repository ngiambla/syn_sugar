 It would have been quite straightforward for the defendants, by their solicitors, by mid-September 2007 to have said that the net proceeds of sale were paid to SA Prawns Pty Ltd, as an entity which had advanced monies to APD to complete the purchase of the North Brighton property.
 They also point out that they consented to the order of 2 November 2007 made by the Court requiring them to produce documents of APD to Mr Ciccarello and his representatives, and requiring them not to incur expenditure on behalf of APD in excess of $2500 without following the notification process to Mr Ciccarello through his solicitors which was then made. 36 There is also the question of the cost which will inevitably be incurred in the appointment of a receiver and manager to the assets of APD which it holds on trust for the APUT.
 But the decision of the Cubelics as to why the net proceeds of sale of the North Brighton property were paid to SA Prawns Pty Ltd as an unsecured creditor, over other unsecured creditors or over the indebtedness to the financial institutions which had advanced funds to APD, is not explained.
