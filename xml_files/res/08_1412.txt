 I heard oral submissions as to costs after judgment was delivered but gave Arc Energy Ltd ("Arc") and Buru Energy Ltd leave to put in further written submissions directed to the case of Re Crusader Limited (1996) 1 Qd R 117 cited by Oil Basins.
 Indeed, Arc's solicitors corrected the errors in the formulation of the s 413 orders as expressed in Oil Basins' interlocutory application. (b) The interlocutory process filed on behalf of Oil Basins indicates that the adjournment application, which proposed a supplementary statement be issued and a fresh scheme meeting be held, was an "alternative".
 Order 5 proposed an adjournment of the hearing, the preparation and distribution to shareholders of a supplementary statement, and the convening of a further scheme meeting of members, which would then have resulted in a further Court hearing before this Court.
 Oil Basins' conduct in bringing such a belated application upon a paucity of fact and without a satisfactory explanation leads me to conclude that its real reasons are for some commercial gain or advantage, by putting a roadblock in front of the progress of the scheme.
