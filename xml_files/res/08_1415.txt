 Ms Stackhouse is not aware of any use of the opposed trade mark by any person or any use by a third party of any trade mark HUGGIE, HUGGIES or HUGGY relating to baby and toddler related goods and services. 24 Ms Roslyn Russell is the senior trade marks and packaging co-ordinator of Kimberly-Clark Australia.
 Other than the opponent's HUGGIES trade marks and the opponent's application Mr Williams found two trade marks in class 28 (toys and games), being composite word and device marks (Huggy Sport and Huggy Buggy). 26 Mr Williams also served a subpoena on the respondent requiring production of documents relating to any use of the "HUGGIE" MUMMY trade mark in Australia or intention to use or authorise the use of the mark.
 These products are likely to be bought quickly, on a recurrent basis, without much thought (at least after the first occasion for purchase) and, in the case of sales of the opponent's goods, by reference to the essential brand identifier HUGGIES (whether appearing alone or as part of a composite mark).
 I accept that use of the respondent's trade mark would be likely to mislead and deceive consumers in relation to the supply of the nominated goods; the circumstances described above mean that some consumers confronted by the "HUGGIE" MUMMY mark in the course of the respondent's authorised use will be likely to identify the opponent as the source of the goods or think that there is an affiliation between the opponent and the respondent's services.
