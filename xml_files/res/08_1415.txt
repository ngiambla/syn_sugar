 Ms Stackhouse is not aware of any use of the opposed trade mark by any person or any use by a third party of any trade mark HUGGIE, HUGGIES or HUGGY relating to baby and toddler related goods and services. 24 Ms Roslyn Russell is the senior trade marks and packaging co-ordinator of Kimberly-Clark Australia.
 I accept that use of the respondent's trade mark would be likely to mislead and deceive consumers in relation to the supply of the nominated goods; the circumstances described above mean that some consumers confronted by the "HUGGIE" MUMMY mark in the course of the respondent's authorised use will be likely to identify the opponent as the source of the goods or think that there is an affiliation between the opponent and the respondent's services.
