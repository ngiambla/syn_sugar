 The applicants claimed that the respondent engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and in breach of certain settlement agreements with respect to past disputes between the applicants and the respondent about similar conduct. 3 The respondent did not appear when the matter was called for hearing on 12 September 2008.
 Each matter resulted in the making of an order for transfer of the disputed domain name from the respondent to the applicant in the matter. 12 Searches for the owner of a domain name may be carried out using what is known as a "Whois" search. 13 Searches establish that, from about November 2007, the respondent registered further domain names (namely, www.macquarry.com, www.macuarie.info, www.macuarie.biz, www.macuarie.us, www.maquarie.info and www.maquarie.biz, referred to as the "Domain Names" in the applicants' proposed orders).
 However, there is no sponsorship arrangement between the applicants and the respondent. 14 Searches also disclosed that, after the date of the agreement and deed, the respondent published material on websites in respect of which the respondent is the owner of the relevant domain name (namely, HonourMission.com, www.federal-court.net, MyPute.com, TerrorismSupport.com, Arrogantosa.com, BDWaldRon.com, I-C-A-C.com, may-day.biz, www.response.continues.biz and www.muckworry.com, referred to as the "Further Domain Names" in the applicants' proposed orders).
 The relief to which the applicants appear entitled on the statement of claim (and which the Court has power to grant) is relief to remedy and restrain the respondent's breaches of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and s 42 of the Fair Trading Act and the terms of the agreement and deed. 22 The applicants' proposed orders 1 to 4 and 10 involve declarations relating to the respondent's breaches and injunctions to restrain them in relatively conventional terms.
