 Section 14 relevantly provides that the provisions of a close-out netting contract are effective as regards the obligations the contract imposes, both outside external administration (s 14(1)) and in external administration (s 14(2)) despite any other law (s 14(4)).
 The administrators take the view that s 554(1) , which provides that the amount of any debt or claim in the winding up is to be computed from the "relevant date", requires there to be a netting as at 27 March 2008.
 In effect, the administrators suggest that the Corporations Act will lead to more or less the same valuation as in accordance with an automatic netting due to their appointment being an event of default under the contract. 71 In my opinion, the position taken by the administrators is not correct.
