 1 This is an application by the applicant (the University) seeking interlocutory injunctive relief against the first respondent, Dr Gray, and a company, ACN 132 442 114 Pty Limited (ACN), in which Dr Gray owns all the shares and is the sole director. 2 I set out, in brief, the relevant circumstances.
 The consequence is that Dr Gray now has a relevant interest in around one million shares in Sirtex. 5 The main ground relied upon by the University today in support of its application for an interlocutory injunction pending the appeal, is that unless an injunction is granted restraining disposal by Dr Gray of his interest in ACN and the disposal by ACN of the Sirtex shares, the subject-matter of the appeal would be lost and the appeal rendered nugatory.
 On that point, the University contends that the balance of convenience strongly favours it, because the claim it makes is a proprietary claim, and the subject-matter of the appeal is at risk of being lost, because the Sirtex shares in which they claim an interest, are no longer held by Dr Gray, but are held by ACN. 13 That obviously is a powerful consideration. 14 I also have to consider the position from Dr Gray's perspective.
