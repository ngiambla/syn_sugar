 It seeks to challenge the decision of the Tribunal, of which judicial review was not sought, that SZJXW's father does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason if he returns to Ukraine.
 SZJXW's mother did not assert any independent claims of her own before the Tribunal. 4 The statement concludes: I believe that my life would be in danger in Ukraine --- first of all, my parents did not return to Ukraine in time, they applied for Protection visas and if they went back to Ukraine they will be questioned about their overstaying their visas and it would be clear that they made an application for Protection.
 These applications were rejected by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on the basis that their claims to be entitled to protection visas had already been determined adversely to them. 6 In Al Raied v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1357 at [6] I deprecated the artificiality of a statement such as that purportedly made by SZJXW in this matter.
