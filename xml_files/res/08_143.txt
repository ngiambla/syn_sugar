 These applications were rejected by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on the basis that their claims to be entitled to protection visas had already been determined adversely to them. 6 In Al Raied v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1357 at [6] I deprecated the artificiality of a statement such as that purportedly made by SZJXW in this matter.
 I have no information before me that the Ukrainian police are unwilling or unable to protect ethnic Armenians or Russians or Greeks or Armenian/Greeks or Ukrainians married to Armenian/Greeks or children of mixed Armenian/Greek/Ukrainian ethnicity in the Ukraine.
 The applicant also claims that as her parents did not return to Ukraine in time, they applied for protection visas and if they went back to Ukraine they will be questioned about their overstaying their visas and it would be clear that they made an application for Protection.
