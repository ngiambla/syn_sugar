 In this Court, as the Full Court has observed, the merits of that particular controversy are irrelevant. 25 The significant factual controversy in this Court is whether those of the OMB parties who are parties to an OMB Agreement are "independent contractors" within the meaning of that term for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act .
 The end to which they are directed is the drawing of a conclusion that those parties were not "independent contractors" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . 40 The point taken for the BoQ parties is that these allegations are not relevant to the drawing of that conclusion. 41 I have reflected upon whether the point is sufficiently doubtful as to make it prudent to leave its determination to trial.
