 It asserted that there was nothing that occurred during the operational service prior to the assumed onset of sleep apnoea in 1970-1971 "... that in any way caused or contributed to his obesity over and above the existing that [he] was eating to excess and not exercising sufficiently".
 The fact that prior to his operational service Mr Gilkinson may have been well on the way to that physical state, did not mean that when he arrived there his obesity had not arisen out of or been attributable to his operational service at all.
 It did not deal with shift work. 27 The Commission argued before me that while Dr Volker made a suggestion that shift work had contributed to Mr Gilkinson's weight gain, that aspect of operational service had not deprived him of the ability to choose how much he ate, drank or exercised.
