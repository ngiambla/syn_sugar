 The genuine dispute alleged by West is whether certain amounts are in fact payable and owing under the contract; the offsetting claim is for losses said to arise out of Ultradrilling's breach of the contract due to its delay in completing the work.
 Additional cost of run casing and gravel pack - $21,659 13 West contended that all of the works to be carried out by Ultradrilling were set out in a purchase order dated 13 June 2007 from West to Ultradrilling ("the Purchase Order").
 Offsetting claims 23 As noted earlier, West contended that it also had offsetting claims of $120,420 against Ultradrilling based on Ultradrilling's alleged delay in completing the drilling work that was said to constitute a breach of the contract between West and Ultradrilling.
 As noted earlier, what is in dispute is the cause of the delays and, having determined the cause, the precise costs resulting from those delays and their recoverability under the contract (i.e. whether the delays constitute breaches of one or more terms of the contract).
