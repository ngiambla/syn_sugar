 The VMM 1997 Agreement included provisions for meter reader salary rates and casual employees. 18 On 30 June 1998, the Commission made the 1998 Award, which is relied on by Mr Urquhart as the source of his entitlement to relief.
 Mr Lang's uncontested evidence was that, although Marshmans was a labour hire company rather than a meter reading company, Marshmans ran the meter reading functions "in almost exactly the same way as ...VMM", save that the amount paid to Marshmans was calculated on an hourly rate.
 Further, there was no transfer of assets from Powercor to AMRS. (c) If Powercor's meter reading function constituted its business or part of its business and such business was transmitted to AMRS, then neither the 1998 Award, nor the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement applied to meter readers (such as Mr Urquhart).
