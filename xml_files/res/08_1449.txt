 After that process has been completed the taxing officer (the Registrar/Deputy Registrar, the District Registrar or Deputy District Registrar) is to issue a sealed certificate of taxation that must be served on the party which is required to pay. 14 In circumstances where the party who is required to pay has not received the estimate, the paying party may apply to the Court for an order to set aside the certificate of taxation: O 62 r 46(3)(cb) FCR.
 From these provisions it can be seen that in circumstances where a litigant receives a copy of the estimate it is not open under O 62 r 46(3)(cb) FCR to set aside the certificate of taxation or any order which is based upon it: Cytel Pty Ltd v Peoplebank Recruitment Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 518 at [12] .
 It is submitted for Mr Mansfield that on its face, there would be a reasonable basis for further inquiry and potential challenge to the bill of costs. 24 In relation to an extension of time, Mr Mansfield submits that ACMA will suffer no prejudice if he is granted an extension of time to file and serve a notice of objection pursuant to O 62 r 46(3) FCR.
