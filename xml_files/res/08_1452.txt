 Section 41(7) of the 1966 Act has the effect that, upon that Application having been filed, the time for compliance with the Notice is deemed to have been extended until the Court determines the Application . 7 The " counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand " relied upon by the present Applicant is his right to set-off the losses incurred in respect to the development of the Merrylands property.
 A more broadly phrased submission advanced on behalf of the Applicant in his written submission was that " where an order for costs is made on an interlocutory application within other proceedings, that interlocutory application is itself deemed to be the action in which the relevant order is obtained (see s40(3)(b)) ".
 For the purposes of s 40(1)(g) , the " action or proceeding " in which that judgment was obtained was necessarily the District Court proceeding. " A proceeding ", it may be noted, " may mean something as distinct from an action or any step thereunder in which final orders are made for the payment of money.
