 DOES S 21(1) OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT APPLY TO THESE PROCEEDINGS? 9 Section 21(1) of the Human Rights Act provides: Everyone has the right to have criminal charges, and rights and obligations recognised by law, decided by a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal after a fair and public hearing. 10 Mr Priestley recognises that s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act cannot apply of its own force in these proceedings.
 That is, he says, a Commonwealth law does not "otherwise provide" for the subject matter of s 21(1). 11 The respondents accept that s 79 of the Judiciary Act may operate to "pick up" at least parts of the Human Rights Act in relation to matters before the Federal Court sitting in the ACT.
 THE RIGHTS RECOGNISED IN S 21(1) OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 19 I have already dealt with various applications by Mr Priestley that I disqualify myself on the grounds of reasonable apprehension of bias and an asserted lack of independence and impartiality because, he says, neither I nor any judge of the Federal Court can hear and determine the constitutional challenge.
