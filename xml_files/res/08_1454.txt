 But it is not disputed that the first property (and so far as the evidence reveals the only property) that was subjected to each Trust was the half interest in the Property of Helen or Peter, as the case may be. 15 Prior to execution of the Deeds, Helen and Peter owned their respective half interests in the Property beneficially.
 Consistently with this analysis, there was not a "transfer" by Helen or Peter to an existing trust. 16 I need not characterise what happened as a "declaration" on the one hand or as a "settlement" on the other. 17 The expression "beneficiary" is not defined for the purposes of subs (5) of s 104-55 and of s 104-60.
 As well, the Fund was to include moneys, investments, policies of insurance or assurance and other property transferred to the Fund from any other superannuation fund or arrangement. 26 Clause 6.4 provided that the purpose of the Fund was to provide superannuation benefits for Members and their "Dependants" after the retirement of a Member. 27 Clause 7.2 dealt with the appointment of trustees.
