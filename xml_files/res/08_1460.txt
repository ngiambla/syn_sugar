 The appellant contended that whereas VSAI v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1602 at [53] required only that conduct be " deliberate or pre-meditated, that is motivated " for the purposes of s 91R(1)(c) , the Tribunal had required that the conduct be "premeditated, motivated, deliberate and habitual". 9 The Federal Magistrate did not accept the appellant's contention and concluded that the appellant had misconceived the Tribunal's use of the term "systematic" in the context in which it arose.
 Any harassment coming from the unionists will be a breach of the peace agreement. 11 The appellant contended that by contrast, the Tribunal found that it did not believe the appellant's claim that he would have been in a position to terminate the employment of the union members.
 That finding meant that the occasion did not arise for the Tribunal to determine whether harm, which might otherwise constitute persecution, was persecution as that concept is illuminated by s 91R , which raises for consideration whether the conduct is systematic and discriminatory.
