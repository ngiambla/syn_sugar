 He sought an adjournment of the proceedings to some later date such as December 2008 (or some other time) and an order revoking the Commonwealth's joinder as the second respondent to the proceedings. 4 Mr Ugur filed two initiating processes on 24 September 2007 (although both bear the proceedings number NSD 1907/2007).
 The application for review seeks an order that the Court refer the matter back to HREOC for further investigation and interlocutory orders for the production of documents by bodies which are not parties to the proceedings (namely, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (the Department) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman). 6 The second initiating document is a claim alleging unlawful discrimination (as provided for in s 46PO of the HREOC Act).
 For these reasons I have also decided to decline to continue to inquire into your complaint under sections 20(2)(c)(v) and 20(2)(c)(vi) of the HREOC Act. 16 Under the heading "Allegations of race discrimination" the notice of termination states the following: You have also alleged discrimination on the basis of race and national origin.
