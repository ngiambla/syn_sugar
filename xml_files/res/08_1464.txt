 The marriage was said to be an arranged marriage. 6 All of these persons, that is, Mr Burton, the appellant, Mr Lionel Burton and Mrs Saras Burton, had previously provided evidence to the Department and to the Tribunal as to the genuineness of the marriage of Mr Burton and the appellant.
 The Tribunal considered that the statements were provided at the request of Mrs Burton and that they were not truthful. 13 Section 109 of the Act and Reg 2.41 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) prescribe a number of circumstances which the decision-maker is to take into account in deciding whether to exercise the power to cancel the visa.
 All of them were rejected and are not raised on the appeal: Burton v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FMCA 576. 19 As part of the second ground of review in her application in the Federal Magistrates Court, namely failure to consider relevant matters, Mrs Burton submitted that the Tribunal should have "tested" the evidence of the "repudiators", that is to say Mr Burton, Mr Lionel Burton and Mrs Saras Burton. 20 This point was dealt with at [42] --- [45] of the Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment.
