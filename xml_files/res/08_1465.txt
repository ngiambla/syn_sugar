 If the Court finds that Technicon has infringed Caroma's copyright in the Caroma drawing, Technicon submits that additional damages should not be awarded because the infringement was not flagrant and did not benefit Technicon.
 In view of such finding Technicon must demonstrate a greater degree of difference between the Technicon pan and the registered design to establish that there has been no design infringement: see Dart v Decor at 409.
 The Court also observes that the inside rim of the registered design is not as deep as that of the Technicon pan and that the front of the shroud in the Technicon pan appears to be slightly more rounded than that in the registered design.
 Technicon further submits that if copyright subsists in the Caroma drawing and Caroma owns such copyright, infringement has not been established as the Technicon drawing is not a qualitatively substantial reproduction of the Caroma drawing.
