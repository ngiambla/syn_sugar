 If the Court finds that Technicon has infringed Caroma's copyright in the Caroma drawing, Technicon submits that additional damages should not be awarded because the infringement was not flagrant and did not benefit Technicon.
 In view of such finding Technicon must demonstrate a greater degree of difference between the Technicon pan and the registered design to establish that there has been no design infringement: see Dart v Decor at 409.
