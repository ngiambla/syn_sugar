 Gyles J said at [65] that the ' voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion ' of legal advice amounts to waiver of the whole advice. 16 In Osland at [44]---[49], the High Court has recently considered the issue of implied waiver.
 Apotex also submits that s 122(2) ' has relevantly the same operation as the common law where the gist of legal advice has been voluntarily disclosed '. 30 The test for waiver of privilege at common law is not coextensive with the tests set out in s 122 of the Evidence Act .
 While I see some force in Apotex's submissions that s 122 applies by Servier "knowingly and voluntarily" disclosing Mr Hamer's advice and reasons as its reasons for amendment, I express no view as to the extent of such application, if any, to evidence that may or may not be adduced.
