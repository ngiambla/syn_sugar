 The relief sought by the cross-claim includes an order that the registration of the Trade Mark be cancelled or alternatively qualified by an endorsement which makes clear that the registration gives no right to the exclusive use of the letters and words "BBQ" or "BBQ King".
 The cross-claim will otherwise be dismissed. 115 The respondent will be ordered to pay to Gold Kings damages in the sum of $20,000.00. 116 The applicants also claimed declarations that the respondent has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by making various representations to Australian consumers in trade and commerce.
 It also claimed declarations that the respondent had passed off, or attempted to pass off, itself and its restaurant services to Australian consumers as being, or being associated with, or having the endorsement, approval or sponsorship of, Anakin and Gold Kings or one or other of them.
