 The decision of Centrelink was to require Mr Croker to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement with MAXNetwork Employment. 4 The power to make such an order is found in s 605 of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) as amended.
 He said that: Whereas those oral reasons may reflect the inelegance of an ex tempore decision, they are in fact the reasons for the said decision. 7 In [3] of his reasons the Senior Member stated that the transcript was annexed to the reasons for decision and furnished to Mr Croker and the respondent as the reasons for the Tribunal's decision.
 The question regarding the terms of that agreement, and whether it was a suitable agreement for the Applicant, have never been considered either by an Authorised Review Officer or by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, and, consequently, are not before me today.
 The first question he seeks to raise is whether or not the delivery of the reasons by Senior Member Allen in the form of his judgment which incorporates a transcript can be said to be reasons for decision given in accordance with s 43(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).
