 There is an affidavit deposing that the quantum of the costs, calculated on a party and party basis, is $157,219.64. 6 The plaintiffs appealed the order of Whelan J.
 The Bank was awarded costs of the stay application on an indemnity basis. 10 The plaintiffs then filed an appeal against the orders made by both Dodds-Streeton J and Whelan J.
 It matters not that some of the costs orders were made in different proceedings: an appeal is a different proceeding from the action from which the appeal is brought. 14 In the Supreme Court the set-off of costs is governed by r 63.55 (1) of the Court's Rules.
 Rule 63.55 does not contain the expression "between parties", but refers simply to a party entitled to costs and a party liable to pay costs, and without words to indicate that the entitlement of a party to be paid costs and the liability of the party to pay costs must both arise in the same proceeding.
