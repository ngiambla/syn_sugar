 By a deed of guarantee and indemnity dated 16 June 2000 a number of persons, including the plaintiffs, indemnified the Bank in respect of the non-performance by Pinnacle of its obligations under the facilities.
 There is an affidavit deposing that the quantum of the costs, calculated on a party and party basis, is $157,219.64. 6 The plaintiffs appealed the order of Whelan J.
 The Bank was awarded costs of the stay application on an indemnity basis. 10 The plaintiffs then filed an appeal against the orders made by both Dodds-Streeton J and Whelan J.
 On 22 May 2008, during a directions hearing in the pending appeal, a further costs order was made against the plaintiffs. 11 None of the six costs orders in favour of the defendant to which I have referred have been taxed.
 It matters not that some of the costs orders were made in different proceedings: an appeal is a different proceeding from the action from which the appeal is brought. 14 In the Supreme Court the set-off of costs is governed by r 63.55 (1) of the Court's Rules.
 In Lockley v National Blood Transfusion Service [1992] 1 WLR 492, 497 Scott LJ said that: A set-off of costs against costs, when all are incurred in the prosecution or defence of the same action, seems so natural and equitable as not to need any special justification.
 Hillary Term 2 Will. 4 (1832), r 93 which was reproduced in identical terms in 1853) was replaced by order LXV rr 14 and 27 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1883 .
 Rather, r 65.14 provided that: A set-off for damages or costs between parties may be allowed notwithstanding the solicitor's lien for costs in the particular cause or matter in which the set-off is sought.
 The former O 65 r 14, as drafted originally, allowed a set-off for costs "between parties", which implied that a set-off could only be allowed if the parties were parties to the same proceeding.
 It appears not to have been submitted to the Court of Appeal that the plaintiffs could not meet the judgment debt and would be wound up if a stay were not granted.
