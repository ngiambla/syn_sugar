 Where the complete application for a patent is made within a prescribed period after the first publication or use of the invention claimed in the patent, s 24 gives limited protection against reliance on that publication or use as the basis for a refusal to grant a patent or the revocation of a patent on the ground that the invention lacks novelty or an inventive step or an innovative step.
 In the opening words of s 24 ("For the purpose of deciding whether an invention is novel or involves an inventive step or an innovative step...") it means an invention as disclosed in a complete application, that is, the embodiment around which subsequent claims may be drafted, which for a divisional application, is the parent application.
 In addition, the respondent submits that: The fact that this [deeming provision] is explicitly provided for in reg 2.3, but is not provided for at all in reg 2.2(1A), powerfully supports the conclusion that, in the case of a divisional application, "the complete application" in reg 2.2(1A) refers to the divisional application itself, not the original application. 33 There is considerable force in this submission.
 I agree with the respondent's submission that there is no reason why the time period in cl 2.2(1A) should be defined by reference to the application which first discloses the invention, because cll 2.2(1A) applies in circumstances where first use or publication will already have taken place prior to the filing date of the complete application.
