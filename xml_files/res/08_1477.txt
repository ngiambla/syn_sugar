 Nevertheless, the Tribunal completely disregards, for no good reason, accounting expert evidence adduced by 3D (and not rejected by the Commissioner's expert) to demonstrate the fact that the scaffolding was acquired in the relevant years (when cash was paid by 3D). (4) The Tribunal rejects the expert evidence on the basis that the payments were not made to MSH or Mr Borg, but to Mr Docherty.
 The Tribunal even concedes at [140] that: 'The probabilities are that the scaffolding equipment in question had been acquired somehow or another by Docherty, but this too is conjecture. ' 11 The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner were to the following effect: (1) Para 2.2 of the notice of appeal does not identify any question of law.
 The Tribunal did not err, in law or otherwise, by deciding the case on that basis. (3) At para 2.4 of the notice of appeal, it is asserted that a question of law arises because the Tribunal, on finding that there had been an increase in revenue, was bound to consider the evidence relating to the costs incurred.
