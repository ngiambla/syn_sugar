 1 On 1 October 2008, the Court dismissed an application by the Applicants under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (AD(JR) Act) for an order of review in respect of a decision by the First Respondent, a Delegate of the Native Title Registrar (the Delegate), made on 14 April 2008 to register an Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) known as the Traveston Crossing Dam Indigenous Land Use Agreement on the register of Indigenous Land Use Agreements (the Register) pursuant to s 24CJ of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (Native Title Act): Fesl v Delegate of the Native Title Registrar [2008] FCA 1469.
 Upon the dismissal of the judicial review proceedings, the Delegate, through her solicitors, informed the Court that she sought no order as to costs against the Applicants. 2 The Second Respondent, Queensland Water Infrastructure Pty Ltd (QWI), did seek an order that the Applicants pay its costs of and incidental to the judicial review application.
 Their Honours took a different view as to the way in which the costs discretion ought to be exercised on the appeal, awarding costs against the unsuccessful appellant. 15 In Northern Territory v Doepel (No 2) [2004] FCA 46 , having referred to Murray's case both at first instance and on appeal, Mansfield J observed (at [17]): [17] It would clearly be remiss to adopt a rule, that where an application under legislation other than the Act involves the construction of provisions of the Act, generally speaking at first instance no order for costs should be made.
