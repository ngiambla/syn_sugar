 It is alleged in para 47 that in reliance on various representations by Novapharm, the USPTO issued the US Patent to Novapharm in respect of the Invention, in consequence of which Mr Glueck has suffered loss and damage. 20 Fourth and finally, there is an allegation in respect of a CIP application made to the USPTO in or about February 2003 by Novapharm.
 In para 57 Mr Glueck pleads that in reliance on the representations, the USPTO, pursuant to the CIP application, issued the CIP US Patent to Novapharm in respect of the Invention, in consequence of which Mr Glueck has suffered loss and damage. 21 Associated with the four groups of misrepresentations are allegations of fraud and forgery, and allegations of accessorial liability, in various combinations, on the part of Mr Stang, Mr Kritzler and Ms Ditterick.
 Accordingly, they submit that all claims founded on each alleged contravention by Novapharm of s 52 of the TP Act , including the claims of accessorial liability founded upon those alleged contraventions, cannot succeed. 24 The respondents refer to the authoritative construction of the expression "in trade or commerce" in s 52 of the TP Act given by the High Court in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 ( Concrete Constructions ).
