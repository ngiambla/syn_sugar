 THREE UNITS IN OPERATION AS AT SEPTEMBER 2002? 62 At the lunch on 4 September 2002 between Mr Nicholas Cocks and Mr Mellor, Mr Mellor told Mr Nicholas Cocks ( inter alia ) that the SLP 1100 was " far superior to the Chinese Shan Bao model " and that the SLP 1100 was " highly suitable to Readymix's needs ".
 Again, that statement was wrong. 64 The statement, of course, was part of the basis upon which Mr Wieland was seeking to advance or support his position that the machine was one of " proven reliability ". 65 As at 4 September 2002, one machine had been sold to a buyer in Austria.
 On a very important point?---Yes. 87 Of the further " Initial Representations " as pleaded by the Applicants, it is considered that representations were also made that the SLP 1100 was a machine of " high quality " and was a machine " superior in quality and had a longer life expectancy than the comparable Chinese made Shan Bao crusher ".
 Especially is this the case where Mr Wieland regarded it as " so obvious that [it] went without saying " that " the bargain between the parties " was that he was " going to solve the problem by providing ... a brand new SLP 1100 ".
