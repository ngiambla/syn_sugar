 In aggregate those investors have lost in excess of $7 million. 3 The reason the applicant seeks leave to bring an action against an insolvent company is that the respondent has insurance cover which may indemnify it in respect to the claims being advanced by the applicant and the group members.
 If leave is granted and the claims are covered by insurance, the unsecured creditors of the company will suffer no prejudice: see s 562 of the Corporations Act . 4 The issue that I must be satisfied about is whether the applicant's claim against the respondent (and at least to some extent the respondent's claim against the insurer) is sufficiently serious to be allowed to proceed.
 While I have not formed any firm view about the merits of the case, Mr Shaw has shown that the applicant's claim has a solid foundation, as does the respondent's claim for indemnity against the insurer.
 My impression is that the applicant's claim has merit and that it is sufficiently serious to be allowed to proceed. 6 The respondent's claim against the insurer is more complex.
