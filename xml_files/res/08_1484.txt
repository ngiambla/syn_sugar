 Mr Taylor was briefly cross examined on them, and confirmed his evidence. 85 Mr Thornton in cross examination denied that he knew if any of the applicant employees were involved in the process of seeking an enterprise agreement.
 Mr Taylor as one of the representatives received conflicting reports of the outcome of the meeting held on the previous day and so he tried to arrange a meeting with Mr Thornton to ascertain the outcome in order to report to the union meeting due to take place on 16 December 2005.
 I have found that Mr Thornton heard Mr Coon and Mr Kemmis at the meeting on 9 December 2005 articulating their claim for the union to negotiate a collective agreement containing improved terms and conditions.
