 Mr Taylor was briefly cross examined on them, and confirmed his evidence. 85 Mr Thornton in cross examination denied that he knew if any of the applicant employees were involved in the process of seeking an enterprise agreement.
 Mr Thornton further said at [9] of his affidavit that he and Mr Sathaar had discussed Mr Matt Coon's problem with Mr Kemmis on or about 10 December 2005. 88 In cross examination Mr Thornton repeated the allegations that employees had complained that Mr Kemmis was threatening, very difficult, very unhappy, and that Mr Matt Coon was terrified of him, found him hard to bear and was at breaking point.
 Mr Taylor as one of the representatives received conflicting reports of the outcome of the meeting held on the previous day and so he tried to arrange a meeting with Mr Thornton to ascertain the outcome in order to report to the union meeting due to take place on 16 December 2005.
 I have found that Mr Thornton heard Mr Coon and Mr Kemmis at the meeting on 9 December 2005 articulating their claim for the union to negotiate a collective agreement containing improved terms and conditions.
