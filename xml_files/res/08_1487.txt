 The period after the notification day referred to in s 66 of the old Act ended on 10 October 1995. 3 As a result of the 1998 amendments to the Act, WAD 6009 of 1998 was taken to have been made to the Federal Court on the date of the commencement of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth).
 Any notification given by the Registrar pursuant to s 66 of the old Act was taken to be for that application and the same people were to be parties (see table at Sch 5, Pt 3 , Item 6 of the old Act). 6 On 10 November 1999, WAD 6009 of 1998 and WAD 6113 of 1998 were combined by an order of the Court.
 WAD 6113 of 1998 was to be the lead application and the two applications were to be continued in and under the heading in that application (the Thalanyji Application). 7 Pursuant to s 66A(5) of the Act those persons who were parties to WAD 6009 of 1998 and WAD 6113 of 1998 were considered parties to the Thalanyji Application.
 The applicants have also claimed native title rights and interests over the sea and a cluster of islands extending northwest to Airlie Island. 9 The predominant physical features of the area the subject of the Thalanyji Application are alluvial, spinifex-covered plains and contrasting sandstone ranges and granite outcrops.
 The primary consideration of the Court is to determine whether there is an agreement and whether it was freely entered into on an informed basis: Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; [2002] FCA 660 , Ward v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1848. 19 One consideration bearing on this question is whether the parties have had independent and competent legal representation: Munn for and on behalf of the Gunggari People v Queensland (2001) 115 FCR 109 ; [2001] FCA 1229 ( Munn ). 20 In Munn at [29] --- [30] the role of a State respondent was referred to thus: 29.
 The Court would look at the evidence only for the purpose of satisfying itself that those parties who have agreed to compromise the matter, particularly the State on behalf of the community generally, are acting in good faith and rationally. 21 The extent to which it is necessary for a State respondent to investigate the claim for the purpose of persuading the Court to act under s 87 was further explained in Lovett at [37] --- [38]: 37. ...
 It is necessary to emphasise that, in the context of s 87, State respondents are not required, in effect, to conduct a trial of the application in order to satisfy the Court that it is appropriate to make the orders sought.
 It reflected much of the evidence given at the hearing, and amply justifies the agreement which has been reached. 28 An important issue which has been addressed in much native title litigation is the significance of change in the traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by applicants.
 Is the change or adaptation of such a kind that it can no longer be said that the rights or interests asserted are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples when that expression is understood in the sense earlier identified? 29 The application of these principles on a case by case basis allows for a good deal of flexibility in approach.
 Steps in making determination (2) The Federal Court is to take the following steps in making the determination: (a) first, it must request a representative of the persons it proposes to include in the determination of native title as the native title holders (the common law holders ) to indicate whether the common law holders intend to have the native title held in trust by: (i) nominating, in writing given to the Federal Court within a specified period, a prescribed body corporate to be trustee of the native title; and (ii) including with the nomination the written consent of the body corporate; and (b) secondly, if the common law holders give the nomination within the period, the Federal Court must determine that the prescribed body corporate is to hold the rights and interests from time to time comprising the native title in trust for the common law holders; and ...
 The recognition of the native title of the Thalanyji people is a further foundation for the continued vitality of the laws and customs of the Thalanyji people. 45 For the Australian people generally today marks another step towards land justice for indigenous people.
