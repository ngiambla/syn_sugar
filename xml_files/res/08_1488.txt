 The applicant, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, alleged that during the course of its business Oobi Baby engaged in resale price maintenance in contravention of s 48 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and that Ms Riggs was knowingly concerned in those contraventions and brought their action to obtain appropriate relief.
 Relevantly for present purposes, the following conduct by a supplier when dealing with another person (the recipient) constitutes resale price maintenance: (1) making it known that the supplier will not supply goods unless the recipient agrees not to sell them at a price below the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(a)) ; (2) the supplier inducing, or attempting to induce, the recipient not to sell the goods at less than the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(b)) ; (3) the supplier entering into an agreement to supply goods, or offering to enter into such an agreement, which includes a term that the goods not be sold at a price less than the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(c)) ; (4) the supplier withholding goods where the recipient has sold, or is likely to offer for sale, the goods at a price less than the supplier's recommended price (s 96(3)(d)) ; and (5) the supplier using, in relation to goods, a statement of price likely to be understood by the recipient as the price below which the goods should not be sold (s 96(3)(f)). 4 The infringing conduct engaged in by Oobi Baby arose out of dealings with 15 retailers.
 Sometimes this happened by virtue of the mode of sale, for example by offering Oobi Baby products for sale via internet auction sites. 5 In most cases the contravening conduct is evidenced by 24 emails sent by Oobi Baby to its retailers, comprising 19 separate acts of resale price maintenance.
 Category one emails contained statements in which Oobi Baby made it known to the retailer concerned that products would not be supplied unless the retailer agreed not to sell at a price less than the recommended retail price (s 96(3)(a)).
 An example of this type of email reads: "I think that absolutely everyone will be putting up their prices if they haven't already (if you see anyone who isn't drop me a line and I'll confidentially have a word with then). " Category three emails contained refusals by Oobi Baby to supply retailers by reason that the retailer was selling products at a price less than the recommended retail price (s 96(3)(d)).
 An example reads: "Although we have asked you to adhere to the RRP (as is stated in our Terms and Conditions on our website: http://www.oobi.com.au ) you have been discounting and we feel that we are unable to monitor this.
 Emails in each of categories one, two and three, as well as the email in category four, amounted to Oobi Baby using, in relation to products to be supplied or that may be supplied to the retailers, a statement of price likely to be understood as the price below which goods are not to be sold (s 96(3)(f)).
 An example from the category four reads: "If you are a web-based reseller then there is 100% mark-up plus GST (for example $10 w/s plus GST x 100% = $22.00 RRP). " 7 In one case the contravening conduct (s 96(3)(c)) was constituted by the publishing of "Supply Terms" on Oobi Baby's website containing the following term: Oobi BabyKids does not supply Ebay stores, auction sites or any discount stores, websites or similar.
 By acceptiing [sic] our orders you accept these terms. 8 The despatching of the emails and the publication of the "Supply Terms" justified the making of declarations of contraventions and the grant of injunctions restraining future contraventions. 9 So far as the penalties were concerned many cases have examined the Court's task in considering a joint position on penalties.
 The applicable principles are authoritatively dealt with in NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 and Minister for Industry, Tourism Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 72 ; [2004] ATPR 41-993.
 The inquiry to be undertaken is not whether the Court would have arrived at the same figure as the parties, but whether the proposal fixes an appropriate amount "within the permissible range" of penalties that might properly be imposed: NW Frozen Foods at 291. 10 The parties suggested a $40,000 penalty be imposed on Oobi Baby, payable by four six monthly instalments.
 In these circumstances it is a legitimate course to avoid punishing Ms Riggs twice over for what is, in effect, the same conduct: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) [2007] FCA 1617 ; (2007) 244 ALR 673 at [294] , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Commercial and General Publications Pty Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 1349 ; [2002] ATPR 41-905 at [27] - [29] , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 997 ; [2000] ATPR 41-777 at [13] .
