 Submissions were, however, made in respect to both the granting of leave and the substantive ground and it may be prudent to address both matters briefly. 27 The additional ground not pursued before the Federal Magistrate is a contention that the Tribunal on the second occasion had not been properly constituted.
 The Tribunal therefore lacks the authority to make the decision. 28 It was not disputed that the Court has ample power to allow both an amendment to a Notice of Appeal (see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 28(1)(b) ; Federal Court Rules (Cth), O 13, r 2) and to allow further evidence, if appropriate, on the appeal (Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 27).
 But these are not the only circumstance in which a member may " not [be] available. " Although it is not necessary to resolve the point, a member may also " not [be] available " where an order is made quashing the decision of the Tribunal as originally constituted.
 Any contrary conclusion may involve embracing a proposition that a member remains " available " even though " justice in general is better seen to be done " if that member did not further participate in any rehearing.
