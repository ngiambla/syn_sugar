 An infringing act by Vawdrey of Krueger's copyright in the Krueger Drawings (see [135] of the reasons for decision) occurred after and as a result of numerous conversations between Camerons and Vawdrey in which Camerons, as Vawdrey's own witnesses accepted, gave Vawdrey instructions: see in particular [48]-[83] and [131]-[135] of the reasons for decision.
 I accept Krueger's submission and reject the contention that damages should be "apportioned" between Camerons and Vawdrey. 21 In the present case, there is a single course of infringement (the creation of the Vawdrey Engineering Drawings and the resulting manufacture of trailers) of a single copyright (the Krueger Drawings).
