 However, it seems that, towards the end of August 2008, Sandoz Pty Ltd ("Sandoz") (a party to a related proceeding) transferred two ARTG registrations (then standing in its name) for products in which the active ingredient was gemcitabine (as hydrochloride) to the cross-respondent.
 On 5 September 2008, the cross-claimants learnt from the Department of Health and Ageing that, on 1 September 2008, an application had been made to list a gemcitabine hydrochloride product on the PBS with effect from 1 December 2008.
 They alleged that, knowing that they (the cross-claimants) were anxious to know if any ARTG registration for Gemcitabine EBEWE had been sought or achieved, and to know if an application for listing on the PBS was to be made, the cross-respondent was coy about its intentions.
