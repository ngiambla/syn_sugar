 It was the subject of a ruling issued by the Australian Taxation Office ('the ATO') on 19 December 2001 --- Taxation Ruling TR 2001/12 ('the Ruling') --- where it is stated at para (4): 'Australia's right to tax gains taxable in Australia exclusively under the capital gains tax regime ... is not limited by pre-CGT treaties.
 The Commissioner's Submissions on the Article 2(2) Issue 50 As indicated in [35] and [41] above, this issue was to the fore in the Commissioner's submissions because, on his view, the term 'the Australian income tax' did not, at the time of the conclusion of the Swiss Agreement, include the subsequent introduction of a comprehensive tax on capital gains in the form of Part IIIA.
 The only issue was whether such a tax was a 'substantially similar tax' to 'the Australian income tax'. 51 The Commissioner's position on this issue was that the tax on capital gains introduced by the comprehensive regime of Part IIIA was not a 'substantially similar tax' to 'the Australian income tax'.
