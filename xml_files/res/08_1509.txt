 The following issues arise for my determination: whether to refix at all, and if so, when, the requisitioned general meeting; whether to make any order affecting the record date of any requisitioned meeting; and costs.
 Undoubtedly, Bell's case was founded on a series of varying and implausible conjectures, which I found were explicable and could not be a basis for a determination in favour of Bell.
 The second defendant made no application for summary dismissal of the proceedings against Bell on this basis, and the matter proceeded by the second and third defendants being represented by the same Counsel and solicitors for the purposes of the trial.
 The plaintiff pay the costs of the second and third defendants of the proceeding (including of and incidental to the hearing on 31 July 2008) other than costs of and incidental to the trial before Finkelstein J.
