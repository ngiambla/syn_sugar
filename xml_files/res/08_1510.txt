 This market is defined as "the Australian market. " 28 In paragraph 13 the applicant pleads that the foreign respondents were, at relevant times, (or would have been but for the impugned arrangements) in competition with each other and others "throughout the world, including in Australia" and competitive with each other and with other persons "throughout the world, including Australia ...". 29 It is necessary for the purposes of a cause of action founded on s 45(2)(a)(ii) for there to be an identified market in Australia: see ss 4E and 45 (3) of the Act .
 In paragraph 19(b), for example, it is alleged that each of the foreign respondents: "imposed on its respective Australian Respondent additional operational procedures and restrictions by which the Foreign Respondent could require the Australian Respondent to act consistently with the Global Cartel Arrangement or the Periodic Cartel Arrangements as in place from time to time. " 33 In paragraph 20 it is pleaded that the operational procedures and restrictions referred to in paragraph 19(b) were addressed to unnamed persons in Australia, were intended to be received by unnamed persons in Australia and were "received in Australia".
 In the alternative it is alleged that any respondent who did not contravene the Act by direct conduct was nonetheless involved in like contraventions by one or more of the other respondents in accordance with s 75B of the Act (paragraph 36). 35 No attempt is made to plead any material facts concerning the directions which it is said caused the Australian companies to engage in price fixing or to impose exclusionary provisions.
