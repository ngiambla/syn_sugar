 Further correspondence ensued from the applicant's solicitors seeking a substantive response to their correspondence. 39 On 3 August 2007 the Vice-Chancellor (Professor Milbourne) sent a letter to the applicant advising that he had determined that further investigation was warranted under cl 46.6 of the agreement.
 The Vice-Chancellor received this letter on 23 August 2007. 41 The Vice-Chancellor wrote to the applicant on 24 August 2007 advising that he had "determined that these matters be referred to a Committee for investigation as provided for under sub-clause 46.7(a) of the Agreement".
 The letter said that, in accordance with cl 47.1(a) of the agreement, the committee was to be chaired by a person independent of the University who has relevant knowledge and experience and agreed by the Vice-Chancellor and staff member, and the Vice-Chancellor would contact the applicant with his nomination shortly.
 A divergence in factual findings by committee members does not prevent the Vice-Chancellor from considering the findings and, as noted, disagreement between committee members may itself be relevant to the Vice-Chancellor's consideration. 105 Fourthly, none of the provisions relating to the committee require the committee's findings on the facts to be unanimous.
