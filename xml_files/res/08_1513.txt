 Relevantly, Items 199 and 201 replaced ss 20 and 21A of the ATSIC Act, effectively placing the applicant (the "Commonwealth") in the position previously occupied by ATSIC in connection with the Grant. 2 The respondent (the "Liquidator") was appointed liquidator of Durahwra on 10 May 2005.
 In paras 15 and 16 of the statement of claim, the Commonwealth pleads that on 20 November 2007 Ms Ahmer gave a notice pursuant to Item 199 of the Schedule, apparently relying on Ms Ahmer's letter of that date.
 If (which is not admitted) the charge is of any force and effect at all, it creates no right in the Commonwealth other than to prevent those dealings referred to in subparagraph (1)(d) of the Purposes Agreement. (c) Further, the giving of a Breach Notice (assuming it to be valid and properly given) creates a debt to the Commonwealth which debt is unsecured.
