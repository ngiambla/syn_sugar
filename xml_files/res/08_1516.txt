 This leads to the submission made by counsel for Mr Harding that, at least arguably, the primary judge misconstrued s 30 of the Bankruptcy Act and this, of itself, raises a substantial legal point bearing upon Mr Harding's rights and, potentially, to his detriment if he is denied a trial by jury.
 The ultimate conclusion of the primary judge was correct. 11 Another point sought to be raised by Mr Harding was that the power to order a trial by jury was, in this case, exercised against him without the primary judge considering the facts that were said to be appropriate to be tried by jury.
