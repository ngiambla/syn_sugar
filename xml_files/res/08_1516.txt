 Section 31 of the Bankruptcy Act directs that any application for the trial of questions of fact with the jury in the trial of those questions be heard in open Court. 8 It probably correct to characterise section 30 of the Bankruptcy Act as conferring on the Federal Court a power to order trial by jury as a bankruptcy court, independently of the general power conferred by s 40 of the FC Act.
 This leads to the submission made by counsel for Mr Harding that, at least arguably, the primary judge misconstrued s 30 of the Bankruptcy Act and this, of itself, raises a substantial legal point bearing upon Mr Harding's rights and, potentially, to his detriment if he is denied a trial by jury.
 The ultimate conclusion of the primary judge was correct. 11 Another point sought to be raised by Mr Harding was that the power to order a trial by jury was, in this case, exercised against him without the primary judge considering the facts that were said to be appropriate to be tried by jury.
