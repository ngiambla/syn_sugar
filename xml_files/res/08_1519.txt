 The trustees are concerned that, if they call for an in specie distribution, they may not be acting in accordance with the duties imposed upon them as trustees and officers of this Court as set down in Ex Parte James; In re Condon (1874) LR 9 Ch App 609 (" Ex parte James ").
 It was not to the point that the exercise of those rights might prove fruitless. 11 Turning to the present case, if the trustees call for an in specie distribution and subsequently sell the Shares, any tax liability that might arise in consequence would fall to be dealt with under the law.
 For the reasons mentioned at the hearing, this consideration does not lead me to reach a different conclusion. 13 Therefore, in all the circumstances, acknowledging that there are difficulties, I do not consider it unfair or unconscionable, in the sense referred to in Ex parte James , to direct that the trustees call upon Perpetual to make an in specie distribution of the bankrupt's interest in the Shares to them, and I would make the direction sought.
