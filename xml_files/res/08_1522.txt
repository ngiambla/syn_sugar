 Although Senior Counsel for Mr McCausland did not specifically seek an order that the whole of the proceedings in this Court be dismissed, he did rely upon O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules as the principal source of the Court's power to deal with Mr McCausland's application.
 He also submitted that they were an abuse of the process of the Court. 40 His first contention was that the applicants in the present proceedings are claiming as due to them monies which they have asserted in both sets of IRC proceedings were monies to which Mr McCausland was legitimately entitled.
 He further submitted that I should conclude that the true or real facts concerning these payments are those which have been alleged in the IRC because they have been earnestly pressed in a serious context and verified on oath by a responsible officer of the applicants based upon a consideration of the applicants' business records.
 He also pointed to the long delay in bringing the claim and the circumstances in which the claim was brought as indicating a lack of genuineness in the claim. 42 As to the first point advanced by Senior Counsel for Mr McCausland, Senior Counsel for the applicants submitted that the applicants had not pleaded inconsistent cases.
