 It mattered not, according to the primary judge, that the person actually detaining the applicant in Silverwater Prison, the prison governor, was not a migration officer (as defined in s 5 of the Act) provided that a migration officer requested that the applicant be detained in this way.
 The primary judge, however, rejected the applicant's submission that, based on the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 , the decision to transfer him to Silverwater Prison was a nullity, thereby rendering his subsequent detention in Silverwater Prison unlawful.
 Even if it were the case that invalidity of the transfer decision rendered the subsequent detention unlawful (and the primary judge seemed to be of the view that it was not), the primary judge appeared to proceed on the basis it would be necessary for him to make a declaration to effect before the applicant could obtain damages for unlawful detention.
