 In applying the test, the appellate court is required to look at the consequences of the order itself and to ask whether it finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them: Hall v Nominal Defendant [1966] HCA 36 ; (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 443; Bienstein v Bienstein at [25].
 Nevertheless, the appellant appealed under s 853 of the WR Act to the Federal Court in respect of the District Court's judgment ordering payment of respondent's unpaid annual leave entitlements. 6 Although it was not strictly necessary for her Honour to reach a conclusion on the matter, her Honour indicated that she was strongly disposed to the view that the orders from which the appeal was brought were interlocutory in nature.
 After reviewing a number of the relevant authorities, Branson J concluded that a final order is one that finally disposes (subject only to appeal) of an action or an existing dispute between the parties, and reasoned as follows (at [31]): The action initiated by the filing of the Statement of Claim was not disposed of by the making of an order requiring Citigroup to pay Mr Mason an amount by way of annual leave entitlements plus interest.
 Although dealing with a summary judgment, it is tolerably clear from the analysis of both Rares J (at [71]) and Gordon J (at [172] to [191]) that an order or judgment which does not finally dispose of all issues between the parties in an application or action is an interlocutory order or judgment. 8 The orders made by the Federal Magistrate on 28 March 2008, against which the appeal was lodged, were interlocutory.
