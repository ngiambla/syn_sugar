 If anyone at the time of making the offers had an onus of demonstrating the strength of the argument being raised, that onus rested on the respondent. 24 While the offer in the 10 and 20 April 2007 correspondence was for substantially less than that sought by the respondent, it was, self-evidently, advanced as a commercial compromise to avoid the risks as to irrecoverable costs (and to the commercial relationship) that would be involved in conducting a full trial.
 The argument for the applicant though is that the manner in which the trial evolved showed in itself how exaggerated the respondent's claim had been up to the very eve of the trial (including the offer made by the respondent very close to the commencement of the trial).
 The inadequacy of the initial discovery in relation to such a key document and the failure to correct it until so late in the trial was not adequately explained. 33 The respondent contends that this late discovery does not afford a basis for an award of indemnity costs.
