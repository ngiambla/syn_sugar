 As a result Newcrest had terminated some of its interim gas supply arrangements with other suppliers. 13 On 1 September 2008 Newcrest asked Apache Energy to provide it with the reasons for the anticipated reductions in supply from 16 September onwards.
 A week later Apache Energy advised Newcrest that the allocation "reflects the supply obligations we have, including existing commitments, contracts that expire and contracts that pre-date the FM event that had a scheduled nomination in place for firm deliveries. " No attempt was made to provide Newcrest with a detailed explanation of the kind which Santos had supplied on 2 August.
 Newcrest will, if need be, be able to call in aid the reverse onus provisions of s 51A(2) of the TPA. 26 Apache submits that, even if it made the alleged representations in June and July 2008, those representations had, effectively, been superseded by the information contained in Santos's letter dated 2 August 2008.
