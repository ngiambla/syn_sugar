 The Tribunal found that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the applicant's complaint pursuant to s 14(6B) of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth) ("the Act ") and it is from this decision that the applicant appeals. 2 A party may appeal to the Federal Court, on a question of law, from a determination of the Tribunal: s 46 of the Act .
 The Tribunal also had a further letter from the applicant sent to the Tribunal and dated 24 November 2006, wherein the applicant reiterated that he had contacted the former fund within 2 years but was told to wait. 8 In relation to the possibility of oral claim by the applicant the Tribunal concluded that the only evidence supporting the applicant's assertion of an oral claim for payment of a benefit within 2 years after he ceased employment was the applicant's own statements.
 The second respondent, through its legal representatives, filed a notice of appearance on 22 September 2008 and advised the Court by letter dated the same day that it would "submit to any order of the Court save as to costs". 12 In the amended application the applicant raised nine grounds of review of the Tribunal's decision.
 While it is possible that this statement could be interpreted as a general observation by the Tribunal that the nature of the applicant's claim was such that it came within the Tribunals' overall jurisdiction, as distinct from a confirmation of jurisdiction in terms of s 14(6B) of the Act , in the complete absence of submissions by the respondents I am not prepared to draw that inference. 22 Subsequent to the letter of 15 February 2007, the Tribunal did not raise the issue of jurisdiction with the applicant again and he was not invited to make submissions as to jurisdiction at the hearing. 23 Given that the only issue decided by the Tribunal concerned the question of jurisdiction, in my view the facts demonstrate that the Tribunal failed to provide procedural fairness, and accordingly erred in law as claimed by the applicant.
