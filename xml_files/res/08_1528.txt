 The second respondent, through its legal representatives, filed a notice of appearance on 22 September 2008 and advised the Court by letter dated the same day that it would "submit to any order of the Court save as to costs". 12 In the amended application the applicant raised nine grounds of review of the Tribunal's decision.
