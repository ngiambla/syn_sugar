 1 The applicant in these proceedings seeks orders pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Federal Court Act') requiring the respondents to prepare and furnish statements of reasons under s 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) in relation to decisions of the respondents.
 The basis of the argument appears to be that Parliament has replaced the ' no reasonable cause of action ' test in the previous O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules with a ' no reasonable prospect of success ' test that operates by virtue of s 31A and O 20 r 5 (which refers to s 31A).
 The main point of the applicant's submissions is that s 31A of the Federal Court Act and O 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules preclude evidence from being admitted in a contested summary dismissal application, and that s 31A directs the Court as to the outcome of that application.
 There is nothing in the Federal Court Act or the Federal Court Rules that prevents evidence from being admitted in a summary dismissal application. 65 While s 31A of the Federal Court Act does ' lower the bar ' for summary dismissal, replacing the previous test, that is not inconsistent with judicial decision-making.
