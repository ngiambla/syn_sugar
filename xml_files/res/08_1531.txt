 The third party is so taken to owe the money to the debtor even if: (e) the money is not due, or is not so held, or payable under the authority, unless a condition is fulfilled; and (f) the condition has not been fulfilled.
 The Commissioner contends that the chronology relied upon by Mr Uratoriu does not reveal the full relevant circumstances relied upon by the Commissioner in issuing the Notice. 17 The Commissioner points out that the audit of Mr Uratoriu's affairs was conducted from March 2003 until May 2006.
 However, there was no indication from the Commissioner as to whether that response from Mr Uratoriu related to 50% of the total debt or 50% of the primary tax debt as required by the Commissioner pursuant to Ch 28 of the Commissioner's receivables policy.
 In addition, the Commissioner has also refused what Mr Uratoriu says is a reasonable offer to pay an amount of $2 million in satisfaction of 50% of the alleged outstanding tax debt consistent with the legitimate expectation that the Commissioner would accept such an offer given the terms of the receivables policy.
