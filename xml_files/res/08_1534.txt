 It relies on two affidavits sworn by Mr Nicholas Cooper, the first sworn on 30 September 2008 and the second sworn on 3 October 2008. 11 In the first affidavit, Mr Cooper says that the defendant's sole director, Mr Peuckert, is prepared to assist with the company's business during the period of administration.
 The defendant has cash at the bank of $2,624.65. 17 The defendant's liabilities are said to be $225,764, but that is to overstate the unsecured liabilities by $43,000, which is the debt owed to BMW Financial Services Australia Pty Ltd, which is secured over the Mercedes Sprinter.
 He said: (1) There will be substantial difference in the amount recovered from the sale of stock on a going concern basis by way of an administration and as opposed to a sale by way of an auction through a liquidation. (2) During the administration the defendant will be able to trade on and generate profit as previously referred to in his affidavit. (3) In the event that the defendant is wound up it is extremely unlikely that the defendant will be able to trade on without the support of the employees of the defendant and Mr Peuckert. (4) During the administration I am confident that there are good prospects that the defendant's business will be able to be sold as a going concern.
 The defendant can now only obtain its stock from the plaintiff on the basis that the defendant pays in advance for that stock. 25 It seems to me, having regard to the plaintiff's stated position, that the defendant really has no ongoing business or at least no saleable business. 26 There is no evidence as to how the defendant could continue to trade without the plaintiff's support.
