 However, the Tribunal finds that the stressful events described by Mr Masliczek either did not occur or do not amount to a category 1A stressor or a category 1B stressor within the meaning of the Depressive Disorder Instrument or the Anxiety Disorder Instrument.
 The Tribunal was required to ascertain whether the Applicant had been exposed or confronted with a traumatic event regardless of the position of the body or whether or not he had entered the tent. 3.2.7 The Tribunal appears to confuse between what constituted a traumatic event and whether or not the event took place.
 He argued that the Tribunal's reasons suggested that these conditions had been found not to be service related because Mr Masliczek had fallen at the third of the Deledio steps: he had not experienced a category 1A or a category 1B stressor as defined in Statements of Principles Nos 101 of 2007 and 27 of 2008.
 Counsel for Mr Masliczek (who also appeared for him before the Tribunal) was unable to advise the Court as to whether the Tribunal had been urged to find that Mr Masliczek suffered from these conditions or whether the Tribunal was referred to the Statements of Principles which deal with the conditions.
