 Clause 1.2 The Parties hereby acknowledge that they have received a copy of the Lease and have had an opportunity to obtain legal advice in respect of the Lease and by executing this Deed, acknowledges that it understands the terms and conditions contained within the Lease and agrees to abide by those terms and conditions.
 Here, as I have said, a court, by reference to the terms of agreement between the retirees and MFLPH, would give each retiree possession of the land upon settlement by making an order that MFLPH sign and deliver a lease of the property to each retiree effective from the moment of settlement.
 In the case of Gainsford, the loan amount of Perpetual was in fact not paid to MFLPH but to MFL, and whatever arrangements there were between MFLPH and MFL, the loan amount was still not payable to MFLPH for the purposes of concluding the purchase.
