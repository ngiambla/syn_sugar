 Schedule 3 of that Act inserted a new Sch 4 in the Corporations Law, the object of which was to facilitate the registration of building societies and credit unions and related bodies as companies under the Corporations Law.
 For the purposes of this Part, s 16C provides that a friendly society is a body that is registered under the Corporations Act that is taken to be registered under the Life Insurance Act because of Item 11 of Sch 8 to the FSR Act.
 Clause 37(3) relevantly provides that: Section 544, as applied by this clause, applies as if: (a) references to Part 9.7 were references to the unclaimed money law of the State or Territory; and (b) references to the Commission or ASIC were references to the Minister administering the unclaimed money law of the State or Territory. 14 The Friendly Societies (Victoria) Code of Victoria, which was found in Sch 1 of the now repealed Friendly Societies (Victoria) Act 1996 (Vic), provided in s 403 that Pt 5.6 of the Corporations Law applied with all necessary modifications to or in relation to the winding up or dissolution of a transferring friendly society.
 By reason of s 11(1) of the Corporations (Ancillary Provisions) Act 2001 (Vic) the reference to the Corporations Law in the Code is taken to include a reference to the Corporations Act .
