 FINDINGS 20 Although an acceptable explanation for the delay is not a pre-condition for the granting of leave, the Court accepts Ms Budd's explanation that, because of her psychological difficulties and her lack of legal representation, she was not aware that a time limit applied to the making of an appeal.
 As Ms Budd has not provided the Court with a draft Notice of Appeal the Court will treat the arguments raised in Ms Budd's application and affidavits as her proposed grounds of appeal. 22 The first proposed ground of appeal alleges that the Tribunal denied Ms Budd natural justice.
 Ms Budd also claims that the Tribunal failed to appreciate that she cannot work other than at home because of her condition and that her need to travel by taxi arises from such condition. 27 The challenged finding, namely that Ms Budd does not satisfy the criteria for a mobility allowance, is one of fact and not of law.
