 By para 13 of that declaration, for example, the deponent refers to decisions of the Japanese Patent Office and the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office rejecting BAT's opposition to application for registration of the LUCKY DREAM and LUCKY DRAW trade marks in those jurisdictions.
 Mr Stern says that the New Zealand dispute involved British American Tobacco (Brands) Inc. ("BATI") which is not BAT; BATI has been ordered to provide security for the costs of the appeal; and BATI has taken steps to pay NVS the costs ordered against it in the unsuccessful opposition proceedings in New Zealand. 30 Mr Stern also deposes to a conversation with Mr Bennett in relation to directions in the matter generally.
 If NVS's contention that NVS is a significantly resourced company engaged in a range of international disputation with BAT in respect of which there can be no serious concern that NVS will not meet any costs order made against it, is sound, NVS will be in a position to provide security promptly and within 30 days.
