 Mr Goring thereafter dealt with Mr O'Connor as the AWU's delegate, to the knowledge of both the employees and John Holland (and, indeed, other parts of the AWU as his letter of 12 August 2005 discloses). 66 The AWU thus constituted and held out Mr O'Connor as its job representative or delegate on this site.
 It did so by its organisational structure (reflected in the rules), the terms of the certified agreement into which the AWU had entered, through Mr Goring's conduct and through Mr O'Connor's own conduct.
 Mr O'Connor had actual authority (and, indeed, responsibilities) as the AWU's delegate to represent AWU members on site in dealings with John Holland and to call meetings of members to discuss AWU affairs.
 Mr O'Connor may have taken a lesser role than Mr Wakelin (the CFMEU delegate) in a particular meeting or overall; but he still acted as the AWU job representative at the meetings of employees.
