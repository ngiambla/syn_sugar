 I have been informed by the Port Hedland Harbour Master Mr Lindsay Copeman that as the ship "Samsun Veritas" is fully laden it will need to be moved to a point beyond 12 nautical miles from the port to enable safe anchorage.
 The Marshal may authorise to be on board the 'Samsun Veritas' such persons as he shall, in his discretion, deem appropriate for the purpose of retaining the safe custody, control and preservation of the ship from leaving the anchorage in Port Dampier. 4.
