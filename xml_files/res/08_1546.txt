 The affidavit relevantly provides: I have been informed by Constable Michael Martin that at 5pm on 15 October 2008 the ship "Samsun Veritas" was arrested at Port Hedland, Western Australia.
 I have been informed by the Port Hedland Harbour Master Mr Lindsay Copeman that as the ship "Samsun Veritas" is fully laden it will need to be moved to a point beyond 12 nautical miles from the port to enable safe anchorage.
 The consignee has not been heard from, indeed, the owners of the vessel have not appeared and the Marshal does not oppose the ship going to Dampier provided adequate security arrangements both in a physical and financial sense are accommodated.
 The Marshal may authorise to be on board the 'Samsun Veritas' such persons as he shall, in his discretion, deem appropriate for the purpose of retaining the safe custody, control and preservation of the ship from leaving the anchorage in Port Dampier. 4.
