 The Fund provides compensation for persons who have suffered loss as a result of defaults by legal practitioners, as well as providing for legal aid and other public purposes. 4 With operation from 28 June 2002, the Legal Profession Act 1993 was amended to deal specifically with the remuneration and costs of liquidators appointed under the Corporations Act to solicitors' unregistered managed investment schemes.
 It did so by, in s 661, repealing s 108(2)(a)(iii) of the Legal Profession Act 1993 , and enacting s 657, which provides: Notwithstanding section 16 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 , the Trust is not obliged to apply the funds of the Guarantee Fund in payment of any remuneration payable to, and costs incurred by, a liquidator appointed under section 601EE of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth to wind up an unregistered managed investment scheme operated by a law practice on the application of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or a member of that scheme. 9 The Trust has now brought an interlocutory application.
 It also provided a further avenue for review by the Court, additional to those contained in par 2(c)(i) and (ii) of the 2001 Order (which provided, in general terms, for ASIC, Piggott Wood Baker, any investor in the scheme, or the Liquidator to apply to the Court for directions).
