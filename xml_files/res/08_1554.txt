 That will follow if the appeal is found not to have been discontinued. 5 Section 60(4) of the Act provides: Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, a bankrupt may continue, in his or her own name, an action commenced by him or her before he or she became a bankrupt in respect of: (a) any personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt, his or her spouse or a member of his or her family; or (b) the death of his or her spouse or of a member of his or her family. 6 So the question is whether this appeal, having been commenced before the bankruptcy, is an action "in respect of" any personal injury or wrong done to the appellant.
 As might be expected, the cases recognise a distinction between claims which are referable to a bankrupt's financial and property rights (so the loss, if established, is to the property or estate of the bankrupt) and claims which are for damages estimated by immediate reference to injuries sustained by the bankrupt.
