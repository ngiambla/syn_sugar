 In summary the respondents submitted that assessment of costs on an indemnity basis was warranted in the circumstances of this case because: a. the proceedings were based on serious unfounded assertions of impropriety, lies and deceit against the first and second respondents, including a very serious assertion against the second respondent that he attempted to destroy relevant records.
 As observed by the Full Court in De Alwis v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 77: [6] The purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made, not to punish the person against whom it is made: see Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 ; Ohn v Waltob (1995) 36 NSWLR 77 at 79 per Gleeson CJ.
