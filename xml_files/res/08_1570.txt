 Treaties often fail to demonstrate the precision of domestic legislation and should thus not be applied with "taut logical precision". ' 71 DAPFI submitted that the Commissioner's submissions depart from an application of these principles in two material respects: (a) They seek to confine reference to the 'context, object and purpose' to that of the Treaty as a whole, and to avoid reference to those considerations in interpretation 'of the treaty provisions'.
 Amounts 'in the nature of interest' which were (or were deemed to be) distributions on shares were for treaty purposes allocated to Art 10, as 'income from shares' (Art 10(6)), which might be subjected to withholding tax at 15%, and were excluded from Art 1l by the concluding words of Art 11(5); but Australia in any event limited its withholding tax on such amounts to 10%, treating them as the yield on debt interests.
 Relevantly, the term 'dividends' as used in Art 10 is defined in Art 10(6) (see [25] above) to mean '... income from shares, as well as other amounts which are subjected to the same income tax treatment as income from shares by the law of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident for the purpose of its tax '.
