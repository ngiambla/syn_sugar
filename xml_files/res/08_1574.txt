 Counsel indicated that the parties had agreed that the appropriate penalty would be somewhere in the range of $1,200 to $1,600, being 60% to 80% of the maximum penalty prescribed under the Act. 9 I was also advised that the parties had agreed that the applicant should have the costs of the proceeding but that they be limited to $2,000. 10 In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [1996] FCA 1134 ; (1996) 71 FCR 285 at 290-291, Burchett and Kiefel JJ (with whom Carr J generally agreed) discussed the question of the Court's role on fixing the quantum of penalty in circumstances where the parties had indicated a range within which a civil penalty ought to be imposed.
 Accordingly, when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement, they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts, together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed. (iv) The view of the regulator, as a specialist body, is a relevant, but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty.
 Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts, the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so. (vi) Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty, it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement.
