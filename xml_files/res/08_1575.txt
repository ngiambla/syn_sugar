 Further, for a time Ms Wyatt and Mr Cooper sought to be separately represented in this proceeding. 4 On 5 November 2007, the first five named members of the applicant (the applicant movers) filed a notice of motion seeking orders that Ms Wyatt and Mr Cooper be removed as applicants and that the Register of Native Title Claims be amended accordingly. 5 The evidence relied on by the applicant movers comprises affidavits from Ms Sambo, one of the applicant movers, and Mr Shayne Daley, their solicitor.
 It followed from the ruling in Butchulla People that there was, depending on the circumstances, more than one way to change the applicant to a native title proceeding. 22 In Doolan v Native Title Registrar (2007) 158 FCR 56 , Spender J followed the reasoning of Kiefel J in Butchulla People . 23 As already mentioned, in Chapman , Kiefel J used the O 6 r 9 method of changing the applicant where one of the persons comprising the applicant had died, and also where two others had, by their non-cooperation, manifested an intention no longer to act in a representative capacity.
 Accordingly, I reject the applicant movers' contention that it is open to the Court to remove Ms Wyatt and Mr Cooper as members of the applicant by reference to O 6 r 9 of the Rules on the basis that each is not a proper or necessary party. 31 As an alternative contention, the applicant movers sought also to rely on s 66B(1) to effect the removal of Ms Wyatt and Mr Cooper from the applicant.
