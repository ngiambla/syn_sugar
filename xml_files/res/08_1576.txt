 For the years of income ended 30 June 1995 --- 1997 (up to 4 December 1997) inclusive the respondent in purported reliance upon section 108 ITAA 36 purported to include in amended assessments of the applicant amounts equal in quantum to 50% of the amount of the deemed dividends claimed by the respondent to have been paid by the company during the years of income ended 30 June 1995 --- 1997 inclusive. 16.
 Further, for the years of income ended 30 June 1997 --- 2005 inclusive the respondent did not consider whether the amounts included in the amended assessments for the applicant had been paid or credited to the applicant, whether the company had any distributable profits for the years of income ended 30 June 1997 --- 2005 inclusive, or whether the amounts represented a distribution of profits by the company. 19.
 By reason of the matters pleaded in paragraphs 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 the respondent failed to make any genuine attempt to ascertain the taxable income of the applicant for each of the relevant years and accordingly the purported amended assessments for the applicant were not in fact genuine assessments, and any purported notices of assessment of the applicant did not reflect any genuine assessment of the tax liability of the applicant for each of the relevant years. 21.
