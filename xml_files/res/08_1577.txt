 Following a short delay, I made directions taking the matter to hearing in the applicant's absence. 7 Included in the orders made on 26 August 2008 was an order that the matter be set down for hearing on 25 September 2008.
 There is no suggestion that the applicant did not receive this letter. 8 On 12 September 2008 the Court informed both parties that the hearing date of 25 September 2008 was to be moved to 26 September 2008.
 Four messages were left on the applicant's mobile phone messagebank requesting him to contact the Court. 10 On 24 September 2008, one day before the scheduled hearing of this matter, the applicant telephoned my associate requesting that the hearing be vacated for one month.
