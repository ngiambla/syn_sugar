 But that is not a sufficient basis for keeping secret the fact that they have made an application to a court. 12 The issue that troubles me is not so much whether I should keep their identity secret, but what to do with the affidavit filed in support of confidentiality order.
 It seems to me that the solicitor filed the affidavit in the mistaken belief that whatever the outcome of the application the contents of the affidavit would be kept confidential.
 Indeed in the affidavit the solicitor said that "[i]t [the affidavit] contains extremely confidential material and is filed and provided to the administrators, the receivers and the ANZ Bank on the basis that it is not to be disseminated".
