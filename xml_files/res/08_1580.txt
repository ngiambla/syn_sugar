 The taxpayer may appoint any solicitor, barrister, accountant or other professionally qualified person and incur "Collection Expenses" in the course of performing its obligations under the deed (cl 3.7) and may issue legal proceedings (cl 3.8). 6 The Collection Agency Deed recites in cl 2.1 that the taxpayer has been established to act as the "independent collection and administrative agent" to facilitate clients in Australia dealing with PPP.
 The taxpayer is to establish in its name a Collection Account at a bank and is authorised by cl 4.2(a) to give a valid receipt for funds for itself when received as agent of the debtor and on behalf of the Principal at such time that a payment direction has been made by the Principal and completed by the Collection Agent. 8 Clause 4.2(b) and (c) have the effect that until a "direction" is given by PPP, funds in the account are held on behalf of the client and after such a direction they are held "on trust for" PPP. 9 Other sub-clauses deal with obligations of the taxpayer, including, under a second sub-clause (c), an obligation not to mingle any money in the Collection Account with its own money or monies held by the Collection Agent on account of third parties.
 For the purpose of administering the Business, the Business Agent wishes to engage the Administration Services of the Administrator and to appoint the Administrator as its Agent and attorney to undertake all the administrative issues necessary and convenient to conducting its business in accordance with the Business Agent's instructions SUBJECT ALWAYS that nothing said in this agreement removes or mitigates the overriding day to day control exercised by the Business Agent over the Administrator by the provision of instructions sought by the Business Agent.
 The taxpayer, in Mr Watkins' words, then processed the standard documents, conducted the first formal meeting establishing the client's "dealership" or "partnership dealership", and sent out the document set to the participants. 19 Mr Watkins said in evidence that the number of Business Agents during the period he was working in Brisbane was "well into the hundreds". 20 The taxpayer maintained as the Collection Account an account with the Brisbane branch of HSBC.
