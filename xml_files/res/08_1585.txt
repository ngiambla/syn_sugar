 Mr VK Sharma, an employee of the respondent who was returning to work after a period of leave and was unaware that the strike was occurring, was approached by the applicant as he attempted to enter the Minto site in his car.
 The letter noted the attempts to hand him the earlier letter on 19 June 2007 and that Mr Reidy had arranged for a copy of that letter to be sent to the applicant's home address.
 The letter went on to state its purpose, namely to provide the applicant with " a final opportunity to raise any matter relevant to the allegations contained in [Mr Reidy's] letter of 19 June 2007 ".
 It is not clear as to exactly how the issue was raised, although it appears to be uncontroversial that the applicant raised his account of events regarding the second Simmonds incident.
