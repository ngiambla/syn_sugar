 INTRODUCTION 1 By orders of Kiefel J on 28 February 2005 the first respondent, Mr Bon Levi was restrained for a five year period from advertising any business for sale without, amongst other things, producing to a potential purchaser various documents.
 All of this, notwithstanding, it is said, the court allowed the second respondent to avoid a term of imprisonment as an order was made for the warrant for his committal to prison for one month to issue and to lie in the registry.
 Mr Levi has a significant record for similar conduct in the past for which he has also been punished. 145 In summary, the ACCC has contended for a sentence of imprisonment of 2-3 years with a suggestion that there be a discount subject to conditions (broadly similar to those imposed by Kiefel J) applying for a period of some 5 years.
