 On 21 July 2008 the AAT affirmed the respondent's decision of 8 November 2007 under s 605(1) of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) to require the applicant to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement with MAXnetwork employment. 3 The applicant filed a notice of appeal from the AAT's decision on 14 August 2008.
 The trial judge, on 25 September 2008, upheld the respondent's notice of objection to competency and dismissed the applicant's notice of appeal as incompetent. 5 The application for leave assumes that trial judge's decision of 25 September 2008 was interlocutory rather than final with the consequence that leave is required to appeal (see s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)).
 This assumption is consistent with the analysis of authorities in SZGAP v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs (2005) 227 ALR 683 ; [2005] FCA 1785 to the effect that summary dismissal of an appeal, without any final adjudication on the merits, is an interlocutory rather than a final decision. 6 According to the applicant's affidavit in support of the notice of motion for leave he received a copy of the reasons for decision pronounced on 25 September 2008 on 8 October 2008.
 The respondent was entitled (indeed, bound) to take any objection to competency of the appeal as early as possible in the proceedings. 18 Insofar as the applicant's claims related to alleged bias by reason of pre-determination and the applicant having an inadequate opportunity to present his case, the facts do not support the submission.
