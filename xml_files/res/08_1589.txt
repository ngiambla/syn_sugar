 As noted in Redberry , the question whether New Cover/Maco made Spicy Sugar garments, as opposed to importing and selling them, does not affect the outcome of Review's principal allegation that New Cover/Maco has infringed the Review Design.
 As noted above, in this case in contrast to Redberry , save for the pattern (and colour), each of the styles of the Spicy Sugar garments embodies a design that is substantially similar (if not identical) to the Review Design.
 In this case, having regard to the directions in ss 19(1), (2)(a), (c) and (d), 19(3) and 19(4), the informed user would conclude that the design embodied in each style of the Spicy Sugar garments is substantially similar in overall impression to the Review Design considered as a whole, principally because of the identity in the shape, configuration and ornamentation.
 As indicated in Redberry , pattern, including colour, is a feature that an informed user would consider important in creating the overall impression of the Review Design, a conclusion borne out by the use of colour photographs to depict the design in the registration application.
