 It is unclear why Vawdrey would appear to submit, against its own interests and against what has already been acknowledged by the Court in its favour, that Camerons should be liable for less than all such costs.
 For example, evidence that Camerons communicated the substance of the Krueger Drawings to Vawdrey in order to aid Vawdrey in the creation of its own drawings was relevant to establishing both a breach of Camerons' obligation of confidence to Krueger as well as a breach of Krueger's copyright in the Krueger Drawings.
 In those circumstances, Vawdrey's failure to explain its possession of the document and adoption instead of the position that its proposal to Camerons was independent of Krueger's suggests a wilful disregard of known facts.
