 The term "Sonic Purchaser" would be defined as Sonic or the New Zealand subsidiary if Sonic should nominate it prior to 8.00 am on the "Implementation Date" identified in the Scheme (in the events that happened, the Implementation Date was 30 September 2008). 7 The proposed change of transferee had implications for a Deed Poll dated 6 August 2008 that Sonic had executed in favour of each "Scheme Participant" (being each IPN Shareholder as at the "Record Date" other than Sonic).
 By cl 7.1, Sonic also undertook, in order to give effect to any such amendment, to enter into a further deed poll in favour of the Scheme Participant giving effect to the amendment. 8 On 15 September 2008, IPN and Sonic entered into an "amendment agreement" by which it was agreed that the Scheme and the Deed Poll be amended.
 For example, the purpose may be to overcome minor technical errors or oversights present in the scheme as agreed to by the shareholders (see, for example, Re H Craig Pty Ltd ); to bring the scheme as agreed to by them into line with the explanatory statement that was sent to them (see, for example, Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd ); or to protect creditors (see, for example, Re Evandale Estates Ltd ).
