 In a report dated 5 February 2007 Mr Lipson concluded that the shares had no market value and that it was "reasonable therefore to transfer these shares to the existing shareholder [ie Mrs Weeden] at $2 per share".
 As such, the relatively small value argues for a higher discount (see the last-mentioned factor in [45] above). 52 Since the discount for acquiring a minority shareholding is wrapped up with the litigation risk and expense factor, I think it is more realistic to fix the one discounting figure.
 Recoverability of loans to Related and Associated Entities 53 Mr Lipson says that a liquidator of the Weeden Companies would have to issue notices of demand to the Related and Associated Entities who would "in all likelihood, challenge any action to repay".
 There was a "likelihood" that those entities would need to be placed in liquidation in order to realise their assets in order to meet their obligations to the Weeden Companies. 54 The respondents have not adduced any evidence to support these assertions.
