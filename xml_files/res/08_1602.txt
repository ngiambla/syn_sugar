 Under s 32AB(6) the Court, in so doing, must have regard to a number of factors (being any relevant Rules of Court, whether proceedings in respect of an associated matter are pending in the Federal Magistrates Court, whether the resources of the Federal Magistrates Court are sufficient to hear and determine the proceeding, and the interests of the administration of justice).
 The applicants did not know whether the proceedings are more likely to be heard and determined earlier and at less cost in the Federal Magistrates Court and note the present quantum of their claim in the sum of $350,000 plus any amount from their entitlements to trailing commissions.
 The respondent noted that proceedings are conducted less formally in the Federal Magistrates Court and referred to the decision in Kurniadi v Loh (2002) 193 ALR 253 ; [2002] FCA 1021 at [21] in which Carr J observed that appeals from the Federal Magistrates Court were not automatically allocated to a Full Court but might be dealt with by a single judge (a trend Carr J described in 2002 as one occurring with increased frequency).
