 The test of relevance is apparent relevance, that is, if the document may be directly relevant to any fact in issue or might otherwise indirectly lead to any course of inquiry about other matters that might become relevant to a fact in issue. (3) This test has been expressed in a number of ways (as summarised at [33.4.30] of Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure NSW ) such as: - (i) the capacity to throw light on the issues in the main case, (ii) documents that might be connected with or pertinent to the proceedings, (iii) documents that could reasonably be expected to throw some light on the issues in the proceedings, or (iv) a sufficient apparent connection with the proceedings. 4 These principles were also summarised in a decision of Stone J, Dorajay Pty Limited v Aristocrat Leisure Limited [2005] FCA 588 at [12] to [18].
 That is representations said to have been made to the applicant that: - (i) his recruitment would be as part of a team, and (ii) the other persons nominated in the subpoena would form part of this team, and a claim that the alleged falsity of these representations is somehow connected with the involvement or potential involvement of representations to other employees. 6 None of these matters are apparent on the face of the statement of claim.
