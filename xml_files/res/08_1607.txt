 In paragraph 48 the applicants roll up their earlier pleas by pleading that by reason of paragraphs 20, 21, 22, 25, 45, 46 and 47 the applicants have been injured in their trading reputation. 46 The publications in paragraph 23, 26, 27 and 28 are not relied on for the pleaded imputations.
 I thought that there might be a typographical error in paragraph 46 and that the pleading intended to rely on paragraphs 20 and 22 in paragraph 46.1, and on paragraph 23 in paragraph 46.2. 47 Paragraphs 25, 26, 27 and 28 are all pleaded under the heading of "Subsequent Publications".
 In those circumstances, there should be an order that the applicants give those particulars. 1.12 paragraph 43.1.1 (paragraph 49.1.1): the Applicants identify the actual facts on which they base their statement of the respondent's knowledge of untruth. 68 Paragraph 49 of the statement of claim raises a claim for aggravated damages.
