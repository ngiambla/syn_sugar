 The Applicant, his father, and his brother and sister all gave oral evidence before the Tribunal. 14 When appearing before the Tribunal, s 39 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act provides that the Tribunal is to " ensure that every party ... is given a reasonable opportunity to present his ... case ".
 It is " the duty of the Tribunal ", it has been said, " to satisfy itself whether a decision in respect of which an application for review is duly instituted is a decision which in its view, was objectively, the right one to be made ": Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409 at 429---30.
 These include the comparative importance (or lack of importance) of any particular submission being advanced for determination and whether the evidence being presented raises any issue in need of resolution (even if not expressly the subject of a submission, especially in the case of an unrepresented party).
 Relevantly, " hardship " to a party whose visa was cancelled was not a matter specifically addressed by the Direction. 37 Also relevant to the making of that determination is a proper understanding as to the role played by a statutory requirement to provide reasons.
