 On 3 November 2005 Mrs Roper applied to the Tribunal for a merits review of the Commission's decision. 4 The Tribunal held a hearing to determine the preliminary issue of whether the veteran had rendered "operational service" within the meaning of s 6A(1) the VE Act .
 It seems intended to raise the question of whether, in deciding whether or not Mr Roper had rendered continuous full time service outside Australia, the Tribunal was entitled to pose and answer the subsidiary question of whether the service was for the purpose of training and familiarisation with the new aircraft.
