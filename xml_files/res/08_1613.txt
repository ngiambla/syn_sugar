 The Tribunal did not consider any harm arising from not being able to complete tertiary studies, to be of such magnitude as to constitute serious harm. 15 The Tribunal then said: The Tribunal has considered the submissions made with regard to the difficulties faced by the applicants in practising their faith.
 Members of the Refugee Review Tribunal are professional decision-makers, and the courts and the public are entitled to expect that what they express in their reasons for decision are, in fact, their reasons for decision.
 In my view it is wrong, in principle, to go outside those reasons for decision, looking for underlying or concealed reasons for reaching a particular conclusion. 26 When the Tribunal's reasons for decision are examined it is abundantly clear that the Tribunal did not restrict its view of serious harm to physical harm.
