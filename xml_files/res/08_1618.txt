 Meaning of transfer of property and market value (9) For the purposes of this section: (a) transfer of property includes a payment of money; and (b) a person who does something that results in another person becoming the owner of property that did not previously exist is taken to have transferred the property to the other person; and (c) the market value of property transferred is its market value at the time of the transfer. 6 Section 120(1) provides in substance that a transfer of property by a person who later becomes bankrupt to another a person is void against the trustee in bankruptcy if it took place within 5 years of the bankruptcy (as this transfer did) and if there was insufficient consideration or no consideration.
 For the purposes of the argument, it is accepted that the bankrupt controlled Ladell so while no issue is taken for present purposes concerning the bankrupt's control of Ladell, the question is how Mr Spencer as registered proprietor at the relevant time could effect a transfer by the bankrupt.
