 The Tax List Judge granted the requisite leave; and, at the return of the subpoenas on 20 August 2008, both parties were given leave to uplift, inspect and copy the documents that had been produced, subject to orders as to confidentiality in respect of the ASIC documents.
 On 28 August 2008, Damaris Amanda Sheldon, an ASIC employee, made an affidavit in support of ASIC's objection to access being granted to the parties in relation to specified parts of the documents that ASIC produced under subpoena. 14 On 29 August 2008, the Commissioner filed and served an outline of submissions as required by the orders of the Tax List Judge.
 The costs thrown away are such costs as have been reasonably incurred that relate to work done and wasted as a result of the successful adjournment application: see Andromeda Handelsaktieselskab v Holme (1924) 130 LT 329 at 330 and Fashion Warehouse Pty Ltd v Pola [1984] 1 Qd R 251 at 254.
 The procedures at the level of the making of the objection decisions are not relevant in these proceedings. 23 I reject Mr Sobey's characterisation of the conduct of the Tax List Judge in refusing to grant leave to issue subpoenas to ASIC and Messrs Nicol and Davies as "precipitous" and as delaying his preparation.
