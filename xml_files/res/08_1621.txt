 On 28 August 2008, Damaris Amanda Sheldon, an ASIC employee, made an affidavit in support of ASIC's objection to access being granted to the parties in relation to specified parts of the documents that ASIC produced under subpoena. 14 On 29 August 2008, the Commissioner filed and served an outline of submissions as required by the orders of the Tax List Judge.
 The procedures at the level of the making of the objection decisions are not relevant in these proceedings. 23 I reject Mr Sobey's characterisation of the conduct of the Tax List Judge in refusing to grant leave to issue subpoenas to ASIC and Messrs Nicol and Davies as "precipitous" and as delaying his preparation.
