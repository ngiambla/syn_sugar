 From November 2002, AFG was the aggregator through which MRPL was accredited to submit loan applications on behalf of customers for loan provider's loan products (para 5.4) and from on or about February 2003, AFG was the aggregator through which MRPL was accredited to submit applications on behalf of customers to ANZ for an ANZ loan product (para 5.5).
 At all material times: 6.1 there was and is a demand, from members of the public seeking to choose and acquire loan products, for loan arrangement services in Australia or, alternatively, in Queensland; and 6.2 loan arrangement services are and were supplied by, inter alia, brokers and loan providers, including ANZ 7.
 If the services are differentiated services, facts would be pleaded which assert strong substitution by acquirers of the primary service and the ANZ service and services provided by other relevant market participants but in particular MRPL. 34 In this case, two alternative markets are, in effect, pleaded by para 7 of the statement of claim in which competition between MRPL and ANZ is said to occur.
