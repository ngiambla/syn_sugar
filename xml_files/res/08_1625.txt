 1 The applicant seeks an extension of time for filing and serving a notice of appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") delivered on 30 November 2007 in which the AAT affirmed the decision of the respondent, the Tax Agents' Board of Western Australia, of 11 December 2006, to cancel the applicant's registration as a tax agent. 2 The application is supported by an affidavit of the applicant sworn 16 July 2008 and one by his solicitor Mr Alan Rumsley sworn 18 July 2008.
 However, the competency of the appeal depends on the identification of questions which are properly characterised as questions of law, as the subject of the appeal: Price Street Professional Centre , at [22]; Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 ; (2006) 149 FCR 522 at [14] . 10 Whether a decision gives rise to a question of law that will support an appeal under s 44(1) requires consideration of how the decision was arrived at and the point that the appellant seeks to raise: Price Street Professional Centre at [25].
 THE TRIBUNAL DECISION AND THE PROPOSED APPEAL 13 The two issues for the Tribunal were: (a) whether the applicant had been convicted of serious taxation offences, so that the applicant is not a fit and proper person in the relevant sense; and (b) whether the registration of the applicant as a tax agent should be cancelled under s 251K(2) of the ITAA Act because of those offences, the applicant's history of non-compliance of income tax returns, including his non-lodgement of income tax returns since 2000. 14 The applicant's convictions are not in dispute before this Court.
 More generally, the option for the applicant of lodging returns based on the information currently available and, if necessary, lodging an amendment was raised on the Section 37 Documents before the Tribunal, including the minutes of the respondent (T13 and 15), and minutes of an interview between the applicant and the respondent on 13 November 2006 (T14). 19 The starting point for the exercise of the discretion under s 251K(2)(d) of the ITAA Act in this case, is that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to prepare income tax returns and transact business on behalf of the taxpayers in income tax matters.
