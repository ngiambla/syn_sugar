 1 The applicant seeks an extension of time for filing and serving a notice of appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") delivered on 30 November 2007 in which the AAT affirmed the decision of the respondent, the Tax Agents' Board of Western Australia, of 11 December 2006, to cancel the applicant's registration as a tax agent. 2 The application is supported by an affidavit of the applicant sworn 16 July 2008 and one by his solicitor Mr Alan Rumsley sworn 18 July 2008.
 More generally, the option for the applicant of lodging returns based on the information currently available and, if necessary, lodging an amendment was raised on the Section 37 Documents before the Tribunal, including the minutes of the respondent (T13 and 15), and minutes of an interview between the applicant and the respondent on 13 November 2006 (T14). 19 The starting point for the exercise of the discretion under s 251K(2)(d) of the ITAA Act in this case, is that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to prepare income tax returns and transact business on behalf of the taxpayers in income tax matters.
