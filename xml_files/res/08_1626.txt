 1 By a notice of appeal filed on 21 April 2008, the appellant has attempted to appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in Pothuwila v Minister for Immigration and Anor [2008] FMCA 345.
 The learned federal magistrate dismissed the appellant's application to the Federal Magistrates Court and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of the first respondent to that proceeding, also the first respondent to this proceeding, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. 2 The history of the proceeding is as follows.
 It seems clear that a judgment given on such a basis is an interlocutory judgment for the purposes of s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and that the leave of the Court or a judge is therefore required before an appeal can be brought from such a judgment.
 It is apparent to me from an examination of the reasons for decision of the Migration Review Tribunal, and the reasons for judgment of the federal magistrate, that the appellant has no way in which he can overcome the problem of the cut-off date fixed for the kind of visa for which he was applying.
