 1 In Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd t/as Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate (ACN 111 210 023) v Cargill [2008] FCA 1382 ( Harbour City Real Estate No 1 ), I ordered that the judgment sum awarded in the Industrial Magistrates Court of Western Australia ( Jane Christine Cargill v Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd and Cecily Robertson [2008] WAIRComm 354 and Jane Christine Cargill v Re/Max Harbour City Real Estate Pty Ltd and Cecily Robertson [2008] WAIRComm 355) be paid into either a joint trust account or into the Federal Court of Australia Litigants' Fund.
 As the authorities indicate, there is a distinction between a party who pursues arguments which are ultimately abandoned or rejected by the Court and a party who commences a proceeding which is misconceived in the sense of being incompetent or unsupportable: Australian and International Pilots Association 162 FCR at 402; Standish v University of Tasmania (1989) 28 IR 129 at 138-139.
 Indeed, while courts should use the discretion in s 824(2) to ensure that parties to litigation arising from the WR Act do not engage in unreasonable acts and omissions which put the other party to undue expense, they should also be careful not to exercise the discretion with too much haste, given that such haste may discourage parties, for fear of an adverse costs order, from pursuing litigation under the WR Act in the manner which they deem best. 8 The appellants contend therefore that the respondent is not entitled to costs at all, let alone on an indemnity basis.
 The appellants argue that the appropriate order is either that the parties each bear their own costs (or there be no order as to costs) or that the costs be in the cause. 9 However it seems to me that to make an order for costs to be in the cause may also constitute a contravention of s 824. 10 In my view the appropriate disposition is that there be no order as to costs.
 Rather, the rejection of the offer must be unreasonable or imprudent: see Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386 ; Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [59]-[62], University of Western Australia v Gray (No 21) [2008] FCA 1056 at [36] and MGICA v Kenny (1996) 70 FCR 236. 11 For the foregoing reasons I will order that: 1.
