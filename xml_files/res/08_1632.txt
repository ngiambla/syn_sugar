 The contended representations on the part of the Bank parties and the arrangements that are said to have been made between the Bank parties and the relevant OMB parties, are set out in a lengthy pleading in the Rossmick IC proceeding (IRC928/2007). 10 Similarly, on 27 August 2007, Jude, Gardner and Ms Gardner commenced the Jude Federal Court proceeding asserting particular representations by the Bank parties and arrangements made between the Bank, Mr Liddy, Mr Quinn and Mr Allsop and the relevant OMB parties concerning the Bathurst OMB agency.
 Put broadly, the OMB parties seek remedial orders pursuant to the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the TPA') and the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) ('the FTA (NSW)') in the Federal Court proceedings (and other relief) and, in the IC proceedings, orders are sought pursuant to ss 106 and 107 in respect of contended conduct of 'inducement'. 12 On 2 November 2007, the Supreme Court (Hamilton J) made orders removing the Rossmick IC proceeding and the Jude IC proceeding to the Supreme Court.
 An application to cross-vest this proceeding to the Supreme Court has previously been foreshadowed and will, in due course, be made. 34 In respect of the Jude Federal Court proceeding, the OMB parties submitted that it is 'related' to the proceeding listed below which involves identical parties, common facts and common issues: (a) The Jude IC proceeding that is (just like the Rossmick IC proceeding) the subject of cross-vesting orders made by Hamilton J on 2 November 2007 to transfer those proceedings to the Supreme Court (once certain conditions have been met).
