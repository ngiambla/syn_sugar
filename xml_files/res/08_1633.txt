 The Noongar Land Council applied to be a recognised representative body under the new regime. 5 Following a notice issued on 7 July 2000 by the National Native Title Tribunal under s 66(3)(a) of the Act, the Noongar Land Council on 28 August 2000 applied to be registered as a party to the native title determination application WAG 142 of 1998.
 This, contended the Noongar Land Council, was an interest sufficient to entitle it to be a party to this proceeding. 16 In my view, the Noongar Land Council does not have sufficient interest to permit it to remain as a party to this application. 17 The functions of a recognised representative body are set out in Pt 11 , Div 3 of the Act.
 Further, the basis on which the Noongar Land Council asserts its continuing entitlement to being a party is founded upon its claim to exercise a representative function, namely, to represent dissident interests within the claim group for the Single Noongar Claim. 22 The Act provides that only a recognised representative body has the standing to be a party to a proceeding.
