 1 The applicants in the proceeding seek an interlocutory injunction restraining the respondents from holding any extraordinary general meeting of members of the first respondent, the Boer Goat Breeders' Association of Australia Limited ("the company") and/or an annual general meeting of members until further order of the court.
 Those orders are sought, in effect, pending the determination of the proceeding in which the principal relief sought is: 1. a declaration that Patricia Edson and Alan Howe were validly appointed as directors by resolution of the Board of Directors of [the company] on 4 July 2008; 2. a declaration that the purported removal of Geoffrey Burnett-Smith, Glen William Telford, Colin Raymond Mackareth and Vicki Roberta Mitchell as directors of [the company] by extraordinary general meeting on 12 July 2008 was not in accordance with s 203D(1), (2) and (3) and s 249H(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act "); and 3. an order that the register maintained by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") be rectified pursuant to s 1332(4)(b) of the Act so as to record Edson, Howe, Burnett-Smith, Telford, Mackareth and Mitchell as directors of the company and a further order that the register be rectified so as to remove Malcolm James Morgan, Colin John Murray, Sandra Joyce Strong and John Ferguson Barrett as directors.
 For example, a notice given on 9 June 2008 for a meeting no earlier than 9 August 2008 would comply with the first limb of the subsection and in that event a meeting might be convened well earlier than 9 August 2008 at which a resolution may be passed.
