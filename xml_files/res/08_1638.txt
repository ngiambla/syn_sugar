 The appellant's husband told her that the PSB was aware of her political activities as a result of the confession of Mr Xu. 8 The appellant had a second basis for claiming refugee status.
 She notes that her circumstances were not that she left China following a history activity that endangered the safety, the honour and the interest of the country (such circumstances being sufficient, under Chinese law, to prevent a person from leaving the country).
 The claims she has made are a fabrication to give verisimilitude to her claims to be a refugee from the persecution she claims to have suffered in the PRC for her pro-democracy and anti-CCP and union activities.
 The Tribunal is not convinced that this statement is true as it finds that it does not accept her claims and it does not accept, therefore, that her documentary evidence is authentic. 27 This is not a rational approach.
