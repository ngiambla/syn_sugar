 1 This is an appeal against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 2 July 2008 dismissing the appellant's appeal against a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 2 The Court Registry forwarded a letter to the appellant at the address for service on the notice of appeal on 15 September 2008 identifying that the matter had been listed for hearing in this building at 2.15 pm before Bennett J.
 I should note that, due to a change in the listing arrangements, I am hearing this matter rather than Bennett J. 3 On 31 October 2008 the solicitor for the first respondent couriered a letter to the appellant, again addressed to the address for service as shown on the notice of appeal.
