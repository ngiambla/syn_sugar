 Telstra's first argument: Ground F of its nature renders the entirety of the affected final determinations invalid 10 In my opinion, Telstra's first argument should not be accepted. 11 Telstra submits that it should be assumed that it succeeded in relation to cl 5A(i) on all three of grounds 10(a), (b) and (c) (in the Request proceeding) and 4(a), (b) and (c) (in the Primus proceeding).
 Clause 7 of the Final Determination categorises the terms and conditions of access as follows: (a) LSS annual charges, as per Schedule 1; (b) LSS single connection and disconnection charges, as per Schedule 2; (c) Terms and conditions to apply to a Managed Migration Network (MNM) involving the LSS, as per Schedule 3. (I note that cl 7 in the Primus final determination does not contain identical wording to cl 7 of the Final Determination.
 If multiple final determinations could be made in relation to a particular notification of an access dispute, there would be no work for s 152DT to do in a case where, for example, the parties recognise after the event that a particular matter ought to be brought to the attention of the ACCC as a matter which ought to have been, but was not, covered by the final determination.
