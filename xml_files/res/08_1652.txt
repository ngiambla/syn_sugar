 THE TERMS OF THE DEPOSIT BY BARM WITH PGF BARM's contentions 52 BARM filed comprehensive written submissions on this discrete issue, and they are set out in [53] --- [58] below. 53 BARM contends that there existed an agreement or understanding between BARM and PGF as to the amounts that BARM put on deposit with PGF as a consequence of BARM's endorsement of the relevant bills of exchange in favour of PGF.
 Moreover, the acts and conduct of BARM and PGF evidence that there was an agreement that PGF would advance loans to participants by drawing bills of exchange in favour of BARM on the basis that BARM would endorse the bills delivered to it by PGF back to PGF, by way of a deposit by BARM with PGF. 54 BARM contends that there is no evidence that supports a proposition that such a deposit was repayable on demand.
 Significantly, the diagram represented that cash flows to BARM from PGF were to be taken as a percentage of the repayments by participants and those cashflows to BARM would form the basis for the estimated tax liability. (vii) On 24 September 1996, Dennis Lear provided John Mathie, Chief Financial Officer of the Main Camp group, with the appropriate wording of notes for the financial statements that recognised the limited recourse nature of the loans to participants.
