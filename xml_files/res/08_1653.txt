 I. du Pont de Nemours Co and Southern Cross University; (b) providing scholarships to universities for study in the areas of AARI's research, making the skills and expertise of the scholarship holders available to AARI; (c) engaging in collaborative research agreements with the university, whereby Southern Cross University provided research facilities to AARI. 131 Obtaining access to expertise resources in this way was a common practice for research institutes.
 The entire CPCG tissue culture laboratory facility including preparation lab, tissue culture lab, instrument and incubator room, cold room and controlled-environment growth room, was provided for AARI's exclusive use for most of the time that the research projects ran, along with a significant portion of the separate and main CPCG laboratory and facilities.
 The evidence does not disclose whether these were all paid (although some appear to have been). 165 The fact that it was the University and ForBio, and not AARI that carried out all of the scientific work is also evident from the University progress reports to AARI from 29 January 1998 to March/April 2000.
