 Cosco seeks leave to bring a cross-claim against Seacope for an order that its (Cosco's) liability (to BHPB) is limited pursuant to s 87CD of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and damages by way of contribution pursuant to s 23B of the Wrongs Act 1958 (Vic).
 To implement its part of the agreement the Commonwealth amended the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth), the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the Trade Practices Act so that proportionate liability applied to claims for damages for economic loss or property damage arising from misleading or deceptive conduct.
 By amendments to the Wrongs Act , Victoria introduced proportionate liability in respect of claims for economic loss or property damage arising from a failure to take reasonable care. 6 In the Trade Practices Act the relevant provisions are contained in Pt VIA , comprising ss 87CB to 87CI .
 This covers a greater range of torts than the provisions in the Trade Practices Act , which are confined to claims for damages under s 82 based on a contravention of s 52.
