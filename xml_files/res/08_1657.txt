 The concern was expressed as follows: We consider that there is a logical connection between [the loss in value of my fund's CNP shares] and the feared affect [sic] on impartiality in that a lay observer may reasonably apprehend that a loss of approximately $19,000 in one's personal superannuation fund might create a disposition against the respondents, who are alleged to have caused the loss, or an inclination toward other security holders who may have suffered similar loss.
 I should start, however, by saying that the reasoning in those cases is not without its problems, notwithstanding that I was a member of a full bench of the Federal Court which approved Barton : see Parramatta Design Developments Pty Ltd v Concrete Pty Ltd (2005) 144 FCR 244 at [36]-[37], reversed on other grounds [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 229 CLR 577.
