 I should also add that, according to CNP's annual report issued on 25 September 2008, the number of CNP securities issued and outstanding is over 800,000,000, meaning that the superannuation fund's holding amounted to a relatively insignificant proportion of the company's outstanding securities.
 The concern was expressed as follows: We consider that there is a logical connection between [the loss in value of my fund's CNP shares] and the feared affect [sic] on impartiality in that a lay observer may reasonably apprehend that a loss of approximately $19,000 in one's personal superannuation fund might create a disposition against the respondents, who are alleged to have caused the loss, or an inclination toward other security holders who may have suffered similar loss.
 Although disclosure of even a de minimis financial interest is no doubt the better practice, Ebner indicates that no disclosure is legally required and that certainly belated disclosure of such an interest that was the result of inadvertence (as here) or excusable neglect will suffice: at [70] (per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) and [167] (per Kirby J).
 I should start, however, by saying that the reasoning in those cases is not without its problems, notwithstanding that I was a member of a full bench of the Federal Court which approved Barton : see Parramatta Design Developments Pty Ltd v Concrete Pty Ltd (2005) 144 FCR 244 at [36]-[37], reversed on other grounds [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 229 CLR 577.
