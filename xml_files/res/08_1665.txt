 1 This is an appeal against an order of the Federal Magistrate's Court of 4 July 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal in connection with refusal of a protection (class XA) visa under s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ( SZLKA v Minister for Immigration Anor [2008] FMCA 909).
 The appellant claims that: - (i) the Tribunal incorrectly found that the appellant could relocate to Kerala to avoid persecution and the Federal Magistrates Court failed to consider this issue, and (ii) the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrates Court failed to consider the persecution of the appellant on the basis of his religion, political beliefs and involvement with Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath (TNTJ).
 The primary judge noted that the Tribunal accepted: - (i) the appellant's involvement with TNTJ, a Tamil Muslim group which fights for the rights of Muslims and lower caste Hindus in Tamil Nadu, (ii) that the appellant faced serious harm, amounting to persecution in Tamil Nadu due to his political opinions, religion and involvement with TNTJ, and (iii) that the appellant could no longer live in his village in Tamil Nadu.
 In this case the Tribunal addressed the appellant's particular circumstances in some detail. 10 The appellant's submission about the Tribunal not having informed the appellant about country information relevant to religious freedom in India also cannot be sustained given the terms of s 424A(3)(a) of the Migration Act .
