 Due to a concession on the part of Cadbury, I did not need to consider the confidentiality question further in that decision. 3 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) (2007) 239 ALR 762 ( Visy No 2 ), Heerey J was asked to consider claims of litigation privilege made with respect to 216 ACCC documents, including the Hodgson Interview transcript now at issue: Visy No 2 at [6].
 In this case, the creation of both the communication (the Hodgson Interview) and the document (transcript) containing that communication was procured by the ACCC; that the ACCC had to offer and discuss immunity for Hodgson in order to get them was incidental to fulfilment of that dominant purpose.
