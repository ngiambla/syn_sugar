 Due to a concession on the part of Cadbury, I did not need to consider the confidentiality question further in that decision. 3 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) (2007) 239 ALR 762 ( Visy No 2 ), Heerey J was asked to consider claims of litigation privilege made with respect to 216 ACCC documents, including the Hodgson Interview transcript now at issue: Visy No 2 at [6].
 In this case, the creation of both the communication (the Hodgson Interview) and the document (transcript) containing that communication was procured by the ACCC; that the ACCC had to offer and discuss immunity for Hodgson in order to get them was incidental to fulfilment of that dominant purpose.
 That is to say, as Cadbury accepted in its written submissions, the ACCC sought an interview of Hodgson to further its investigation; but that statement of purpose is not complete without answering the questions "investigation of what" and "to what end. " 15 A letter from the ACCC to Hodgson's lawyers dated 13 December 2004 and attached to an affidavit of a solicitor for Cadbury answers the first question.
