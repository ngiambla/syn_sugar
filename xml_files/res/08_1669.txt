 The upshot is that, while the Court may consider extrinsic evidence to construe the Deed, it may only do so to establish the mutual understandings of the parties forming the background to the transaction, not the back-and-forth of the parties in concluding the transaction. 16 Despite the general agreement of the parties as to the proper approach, there was a great deal of dispute as to whether and to what extent various extrinsic evidence was relevant to the task at hand and to the case as pleaded by the Unions.
 In the absence of any identification of when, where, to whom, and by whom such representations or omissions were allegedly made, allowing evidence to be led in support of that paragraph of the pleading would have constituted a trial by ambush. 18 Notwithstanding the matters identified in paras [16] and [17], the evidentiary case for each side did not proceed smoothly.
 Therefore, they submitted, the background to the transaction in which the parties to the Deed were operating was one where a requirement that a photograph not be displayed on a swipe card was not to be, and could not be, taken without more to include a requirement that no photograph be taken or retained at all. 26 The only other extrinsic evidence relied on by the parties as contextual background informing the common understandings of the parties prior to entering the Deed was excerpts of the transcripts of the proceedings before the AIRC in August 2008.
