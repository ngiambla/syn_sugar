 The Application 5 The applicant (Authority) sought relief against the first respondent (the AAT) and second respondent (Imtrade) under s 16(1)(a) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and also pursuant to s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 and s 21(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 .
 At trial, Imtrade did not press any further production, and tendered, by consent, one email from the documents produced. 11 The Court concluded that: (a) it was not satisfied that the misrepresentation by Imtrade about the identity of Evergreen induced the decisions to approve or register.
 A formal order in this regard, I am informed, was not pressed because the Authority gave an undertaking to Imtrade, after the Reasons for Decision had been delivered, that it would withdraw the notice. 19 The Authority provided an interim undertaking in response to the injunctive relief sought by Imtrade on the day of the trial.
 After the Reasons for Decision were delivered, I am further informed that the Authority did issue a press release which stated the effect of the Court's decision and published it on its website. 20 The removal of the approvals and registrations from the Record and Register by the Authority was unlawful.
