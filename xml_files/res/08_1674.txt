 The appeal grounds do not suggest that the due date for response of 18 September 2007 contravened the prescribed period. 6 The appellant, by letter dated 17 September 2007, requested an extension of time to respond to the Tribunal's letter until 1 November 2007.
 In consequence the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution and was not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention. 12 The amended appeal grounds call for consideration of the relationship between the decision in Appellant S395/2002 (2003) 216 CLR 473 ; [2003] HCA 71 and the capacity for the appellant to relocate within India.
 I accept the respondent Minister's submissions in this respect that the issue of capacity to continue membership of a particular party and its significance to the "attribute for which the appellant was selected for persecution" ( SZFDV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 233 CLR 51 ; [2007] HCA 41 at [12] ) was one of fact for the Tribunal.
