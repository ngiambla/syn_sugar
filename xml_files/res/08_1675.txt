 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Act Amendment Bill 2006 suggests that the criterion set out in s 190F(6): ... will ensure that applications are not dismissed where there is good reason for a claim remaining in the system, despite being unregistered. 7 By way of example, the Explanatory Memorandum suggests that the Court may consider that an application should not be dismissed if, despite being unregistered, the claim is close to reaching resolution (para 4.331) 8 As to the principles applicable to how s 190F(6) should operate, I refer to and respectfully adopt, (without repeating), the recent analysis by Logan J in Christine George Ors on behalf of the Gurambilbarra People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 1518.
 The area of land within that external boundary is, as a matter of convenience, referred to as the 'Alternative Settlement Area'. 16 In addition to the Amangu, Naaguja and Hutt River native title claims, there are five other native title claims that overlap parts of the Alternative Settlement Area; namely: Mullewa Wadjari (WAD 6119 of 1998), Franks (WAD 6273 of 1998), Taylor (WAD 6006 of 2001), Widi Mob (WAD 6193 of 1998) and Widi Binyardi (WAD286 of 2004). 17 Of the five native title determination applications that overlap parts of the Alternative Settlement Area, Taylor, Widi Mob and Widi Binyardi are presently before the Court in relation to ss 190F(5) and (6) of the NTA. 18 On 3 September 2004, the claims involved in the Alternative Settlement negotiations and Yamatji met with representatives from both the Office of Native Title (ONT) and Department of Planning and Infrastructure (DPI).
 The Tribunal remains willing to provide assistance to the claimants for the resolution of the four overlaps to this claim, however, based on my understanding that none of the respondents, including the State of Western Australia, intend to mediate with the Taylor Group claim in its own right it is my view that there is no scope for a mediated determination of this application. 20 If the Taylor claim remains, but does not participate in the Alternative Settlement process, then it could prejudice the other claims in the process, including the Amangu claim, due to the State's requirements outlined above. 21 Yamatji also states in its submissions that it is not aware of any reason why this claim should not be dismissed under ss 190F(5) and (6) of the NTA.
