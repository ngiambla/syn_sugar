 INTRODUCTION 1 Section 190F(6) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NTA), introduced in the amendments made to the NTA in 20 July 2007, confers upon the Court a discretionary power to dismiss an application, either on the application of a party or on its own motion, if: (a) the Court is satisfied that the application has not been amended since consideration by the Native Title Registrar (the Registrar) and is not likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar, and (b) in the opinion of the Court, there is no other reason why the application in issue should not be dismissed. 2 Pursuant to s 190F(5), the new dismissal power applies where: (a) the Registrar does not accept the claim for registration because: (i) it does not satisfy all the merit conditions of the registration test; or (ii) it was so procedurally defective as to render it impossible to determine whether the claim satisfies the merit conditions; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the avenues for reconsideration and review have been exhausted without registration of the claim. 3 Order 78 r 12 of the Federal Court Rules provides an application for review must be filed within 42 days of the notification of the Registrar's decision. 4 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Act Amendment Bill 2006 provides an insight into the rationale behind the introduction of the new dismissal power: Currently, while unregistered applications do not receive certain procedural benefits that attach to registered claims (such as the right to negotiate), unregistered applications may still proceed to determination.
 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Act Amendment Bill 2006 suggests that the criterion set out in s 190F(6): ... will ensure that applications are not dismissed where there is good reason for a claim remaining in the system, despite being unregistered. 7 By way of example, the Explanatory Memorandum suggests that the Court may consider that an application should not be dismissed if, despite being unregistered, the claim is close to reaching resolution (para 4.331). 8 As to the principles applicable to how s 190F(6) should operate, I refer to and respectfully adopt, (without repeating), the recent analysis by Logan J in Christine George Ors on behalf of the Gurambilbarra People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 1518.
