 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Act Amendment Bill 2006 suggests that the criterion set out in s 190F(6): ... will ensure that applications are not dismissed where there is good reason for a claim remaining in the system, despite being unregistered. 7 By way of example, the Explanatory Memorandum suggests that the Court may consider that an application should not be dismissed if, despite being unregistered, the claim is close to reaching resolution (para 4.331) 8 As to the principles applicable to how s 190F(6) should operate, I refer to and respectfully adopt, (without repeating), the recent analysis by Logan J in Christine George Ors on behalf of the Gurambilbarra People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 1518.
 The application was lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal on 26 August 1997 prior to the commencement of the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth) on 30 September 1998. 10 The application (as amended) covers approximately 53,000 square kilometres of land in the central Geraldton region. 11 The Widi Mob applicants are not represented by the representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body for the area Yamatji Marlpa Barna Baba Maaja Aboriginal Corporation (Yamatji).
 Those submissions were directed primarily to s 190F(6)(b). 21 It was submitted for the applicant that the provision ultimately intended to require the Court to take into account issues of fairness and opportunity. 22 In that regard, it was submitted that in the present application: (a) The applicant has had no significant legal assistance until November 2006; (b) The applicant has been homeless for about 10 years.
