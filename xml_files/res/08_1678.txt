 The amendments inserted by item 73 are intended to provide a greater focus on the responsibility of applicants to take steps to improve the quality of their claims, recognising that poor quality claims are a burden on the native title system. 5 If the Court considers the application has been amended since consideration by the Registrar or is likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar, it would be appropriate for the Court to await the outcome of the reapplication of the registration test before considering whether to dismiss the application. 6 Pursuant to s 190F(6) of the NTA, the Court may consider any 'other reason' why an application should not be dismissed.
 The application, which lies in-between the Ngarluma Yindjibarndi determined area and the Kariyarra claim (WAD 6169/98) in the north-west Pilbara, covers approximately 1,500 square kilometres of land. 10 The applicants are not currently represented by the representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body for the area (Yamatji Marlpa Bama Baba Maaja Aboriginal Corporation) or otherwise legally represented although counsel has filed submissions on behalf of the applicant in relation to the s 190F(6) issues which have been raised by the court with the parties.
 This occurred on 21 September 2007, when the Registrar's delegate decided that the application should not be accepted for registration because it did not satisfy the following conditions: (i) Subsection 190C(2) - the application was not accompanied by an affidavit that complied with s 62(l)(a) of the NTA and the delegate was not satisfied that the application was accompanied by the document prescribed by s 62(l)(a) of the NTA; (ii) Subsection 190C(4) - the delegate was not satisfied that the application was certified by the representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body for the application area and was not satisfied that the applicant was authorised to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it by all the other persons in the native title claim group; (iii) Subsection 190B(5) - the delegate was not satisfied that the factual basis on which it was asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist was sufficient to support the assertions in subs 190B(5)(a), (b) and (c) of the NTA; (iv) Subsection 190B(6) - the delegate did not consider that, prima facie, at least some of the claimed native title rights and interests could be established; and (v) Subsection 190B(7) - the delegate was not satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group has a previous or current traditional physical connection with any part of the application area. 16 Since the applicants were notified of the Registrar's decision, no application seeking leave to amend the Bindurrna application has been filed; nor has an application for review of the Registrar's decision been made.
 Those submissions were directed primarily to s 190F(6)(b). 18 It was submitted that the provision required the Court to take into account issues of fairness and opportunity and that in the present application: (a) The applicants have had no significant legal assistance to date; (b) The s 136G(3) report demonstrates the difficulty the applicants have in dealing with the procedures before the Court and the Tribunal; (c) The applicants have not yet been able to put their case at its best before the Court; (d) There is now a reasonable prospect that the applicants will be able to present their case more effectively in the near future; and (e) The applicants are not legally represented, but there is a strong probability of solicitors being appointed and of funding being available. 19 Although no evidence was provided in support of the submissions, it was accordingly submitted that the application be adjourned to December at which time a better assessment of the merits may be possible. 20 Alternatively, it was argued that the resolution of the issues raised by s 190F should not be undertaken without a full examination of the evidence and an opportunity to call witnesses and cross examine them. 21 I did permit the applicants to file more substantive submissions before determining the position.
