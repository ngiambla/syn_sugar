 The primary judge also identified the Tribunal's consideration of the appellant's claims including that the Tribunal found that the appellant had not been truthful about matters central to those claims.
 The primary judge's function was limited to review of the Tribunal's decision for jurisdictional error. 11 The appellant's fifth claim that the primary judge erred because the Tribunal did not give the appellant an opportunity to give another interview in support of his claims is equally misconceived.
 The appellant gave evidence and attended the hearing on 9 August 2007. 12 The appellant's sixth claim that the primary judge erred by failing to consider the relevant facts does not rise above a generalised assertion.
