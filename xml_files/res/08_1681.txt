 The evidence does not disclose any other discussions between officers of ASIC and Atanaskovic Hartnell about ASIC's perception of a conflict of interest either before the discussion between Mr Hartnell and Ms Dodds on Tuesday 7 October 2008 or thereafter and I find there were none. 14 ASIC's letter of Friday 10 October 2008 was received by Atanaskovic Hartnell by facsimile at about 2 pm that day.
 I infer that from Mr Hartnell's evidence that he received separate instructions in conference from the Applicants in relation to the s 19 examinations on Friday 3 October 2008 and Monday 6 October 2008 and from the obvious necessity for such work to be done.
 It follows that the letter of Friday 10 October 2008 evidences a direction given by them, and not ASIC, to exclude Atanaskovic Hartnell. 30 Ms Dodds and Mr Astar were the persons nominated in each of the s 19 notices as the persons before whom the examinations were to take place.
