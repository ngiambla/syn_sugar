 The Tribunal concluded that it could "not be satisfied as to the truth of the Applicant's claims" concerning the contended relationship. 7 The Tribunal dealt with the factual foundation for the appellant's claims of threats of harm giving rise to his contended well-founded fear of persecution.
 In effect, the appellant asks, why did the Tribunal not accept my claim to a well-founded fear of persecution? 16 By ground 5, the appellant says that the Tribunal asked itself an irrelevant question and ignored the appellant's political background in reaching its decision.
 The Tribunal determined that it could not be satisfied that the appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason because it could not be satisfied, as a result of the forensic analysis of material going to each claim, that the appellant's evidence was plausible, accurate and truthful.
 The appellant says in effect (although it was not put this way as the appellant was self-represented) that the segmentation of each claim and conclusions reached about each separate claim failed to give proper emphasis to the aggregated burden of the total claim.
