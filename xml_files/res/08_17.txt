 The consequence is that he was not entitled, nor were he and Grieves jointly entitled, to make any divisional application and to have granted a patent, including the petty patent, on the basis of an entitlement to Stack or Stack and Grieves under s 15(1) of the Act . 76 As the entitlement of GST to the petty patent is sourced solely in the assignment from Stack which entitled it to registration in the Register of patents, it follows that GST as the patentee is not entitled to the patent within the meaning of s 138(3)(a) of the Act .
 Further, I accept that the distinction between pre and post-grant amendments is also demonstrated by ss 106 and 107 of the Old Act . 81 Section 106 deals with the situation where a patent has been granted, and the Commissioner is satisfied that the patent is invalid on grounds that could be removed by appropriate amendments of the specification .
 Under s 107 , where a complete application for a standard patent has been made, but the patent has not yet been granted, and the Commissioner is satisfied that there are lawful grounds of objection to the patent request or complete specification but that those grounds of objection could be removed by appropriate amendments of the request or specification , the Commissioner may direct the applicant to file a statement of proposed amendments.
 An application for revocation of the patent has now been made and pursuant to s 138(3) of the Old Act , the Court has power, and, in my opinion, should revoke Petty Patent No 662284 on the ground that the patentee is not entitled to the patent. 88 I propose to make the following orders: on the Notice of Motion of the applicant for leave to file an Amended Statement of Claim, leave is refused.
