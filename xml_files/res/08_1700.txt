 I take this to be authority for the proposition that the money need only be put aside. 5 Another instance where interest will cease to run before discharge is where the mortgagee wrongfully states or indicates that it will not discharge the mortgage on the due date.
 In Kerford v Mondel (1859) 28 LJ Ex 303 , after referring to Scarfe v Morgan , Bramwell B said (at 306) that if a mortgagee "goes on, and so conducts himself as to indicate that a tender of the one amount had been nugatory, he dispenses with the tender".
 For example in Mahoney v Lindsey (1980) 55 ALJR 118 the High Court considered the need for a purchaser to tender the purchase price in order to obtain an order for the specific performance of a contract for the sale of land.
