 1 This is an appeal against an order of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review in connection with refusal of a protection (class XA) visa under s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ( SZMCS v Minister for Immigration Anor [2008] FMCA 931).
 Section 24(1A) provides that such an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment that is an interlocutory judgment unless the Court gives leave to appeal. 7 The appellant has not sought leave to appeal.
 The primary judge concluded that the findings made by the Tribunal (namely that, (i) the appellant could safely return to India, (ii) the appellant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for Convention reasons relating to his religion or politics, and (iii) the appellant had not claimed to fear persecution for any other Convention related reason) were open to it.
 Accordingly, the primary judge dismissed the application pursuant to rule 44.12(1)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Courts Rules. 10 I am satisfied that the decision of the primary judge is not attended by any doubt.
