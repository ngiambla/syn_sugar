 The Tribunal found that the applicant's demeanour and her responses to its questions were evasive. 5 Due to the Tribunal's adverse credibility finding, it gave no weight to a document allegedly probative of the applicant's release from detention in the PRC in 2002. 6 The Tribunal expressed concerns over the applicant's stated motivation for leaving the PRC.
 While it was satisfied that the applicant had had some involvement with Falun Gong in Australia, the Tribunal disregarded the evidence of her conduct in Australia under s 91R(3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') as it was not satisfied that she had engaged in the activities otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening her claims to be a refugee. 9 The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant was a person to whom Australia owed protection obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 1967 .
 APPLICATION IN THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 10 By application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 12 May 2008 the applicant sought judicial review of the Tribunal decision. 11 Before Smith FM the applicant claimed that the Tribunal decision was affected by jurisdictional error as it 'did not weigh' her evidence.
 His Honour found that the Tribunal had carefully considered the evidence provided by the applicant and that the Tribunal had not overlooked any such evidence. 13 In considering the applicant's second ground of review, Smith FM observed that there was no evidence that the interpreter provided by the Tribunal had performed its function defectively.
 Smith FM found that there was no evidence indicating that the applicant had been denied the opportunity to appear, give evidence and present arguments as required under s 425 of the Act. 14 Smith FM also found that the Tribunal had applied s 91R(3) of the Act without error.
 The affidavit also alleges that the Federal Magistrate did not consider the information provided by the applicant. 17 The applicant filed a second affidavit attaching photographs of the applicant apparently engaged in Falun Gong related activities. 18 Smith FM's decision is interlocutory (see r 44.12(2) of the FMC Rules) and accordingly leave is required to appeal from such decision to this Court: see s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 19 Under O 52 r 5(2) of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) ('the Rules') the applicant should have filed her application for leave to appeal by 26 August 2008.
 There appears to be no valid reason why such considerations should not also apply to an application seeking an order of the Court that dispenses with the 21 day time limit prescribed by O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules. 22 As to delay, the applicant claimed at the hearing before the Court that her ignorance of Court procedure resulted in her failure to comply with O 52 r 5(2) of the Rules.
 Leave may be granted if it is 'expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined' : see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [26] .
 Such consideration requires the Court to consider the merits of the ground sought to be raised: see Iyer at [24]; VAAC at [26]. 25 As no transcript of the Tribunal hearing has been put before the Court, the only evidence before the Court of the Tribunal's conduct of the proceeding is the Tribunal hearing record and the Tribunal decision itself.
 The Court finds no error in the Tribunal's application of s 91R(3) of the Act. 32 It is apparent from the applicant's oral submissions that she seeks an impermissible merits review of the Tribunal decision: see Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Another v Peko-Wallsend Limited and Others [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 40-42; Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 169 CLR 379 at 391-392; NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] .
