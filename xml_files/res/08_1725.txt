 APPLICATION IN THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 10 By application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 12 May 2008 the applicant sought judicial review of the Tribunal decision. 11 Before Smith FM the applicant claimed that the Tribunal decision was affected by jurisdictional error as it 'did not weigh' her evidence.
 Smith FM found that there was no evidence indicating that the applicant had been denied the opportunity to appear, give evidence and present arguments as required under s 425 of the Act. 14 Smith FM also found that the Tribunal had applied s 91R(3) of the Act without error.
 Leave may be granted if it is 'expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined' : see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [26] .
