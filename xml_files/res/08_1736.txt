 On that day I indicated that, subject to one matter, his appeal should be dismissed. 2 That matter arose out of the fact that the appellant had, prior to the Tribunal's first decision, asserted that he wished to cross-examine a witness upon whose evidence the Tribunal relied in reaching that decision.
 The Tribunal also relied on that evidence in reaching its second decision, again noting that the appellant had previously sought to cross-examine the witness and again pointing out that he had no right to do so.
 In referring to the matter to the Registrar I, as a member of the Court, decided that it was for the public good that the matter be investigated.
