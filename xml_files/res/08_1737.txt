 1 The applicants (collectively, Black Decker) apply for an order under O 62, r 4(2)(c) and (d) of the Federal Court Rules for a gross sum assessment of their costs. 2 Black Decker succeeded in a claim for patent infringement.
 On 18 April 2008 I gave judgment in their favour on liability issues and on 19 June 2008, amongst other things, I ordered that the respondent GMCA pay Black Decker's costs of the claim and cross-claim, including reserved costs, such costs to be taxed as between party and party except for some items on an indemnity basis.
 The purpose of the rule is to avoid the expense, delay and aggravation involved in litigation arising out of the taxation process: Leary v Leary [1987] 1 WLR 72; Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (No 2) (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120. 4 The main ground on which Black Decker rely is what is said to be the dire financial circumstances of GMCA, coupled with certain transactions which may be set aside if Black Decker are able to obtain a winding up order reasonably promptly.
 The letter stated that GMCA was attempting to avoid the need for external administration and as a consequence expenses such as legal fees and court application costs would need to be minimised. (Kahns Lawyers have subsequently been retained and are now on the record again. ) 7 On 2 October Emmett J made orders dismissing the appeal and application for leave to appeal by GMCA.
