 This rebate was negotiated specifically with individual customers. 6 The net profit was calculated by deducting from the gross profit figure percentages for freight, "company overhead", warranty, RD, and (in respect of T2 only) amortisation.
 The main dispute in the case was that the infringer argued for an "incremental" approach, ie the difference between the profits in fact made and the profits, if any, that would have been made if a non-infringing process were used (at [16]).
 His Lordship then discussed the application of the apportionment approach to the facts of the case (at [77]-[130]). 12 The facts in Celanese are quite different from the present case where no apportionment based on infringing and non-infringing parts of T1 or T2 is claimed.
