 It was instructed to print, then mail out the incorrect notice to the shareholders in accordance with the requirements of s 650D(1)(c)(ii) CA. 9 Emerald has subsequently discovered that in fact the share registry company did not print and mail the incorrect notice to GLI shareholders but printed and mailed to GLI shareholders a previous notice of extension which had been prepared by Emerald in relation to an earlier extension of the offer. 10 On 12 November 2008, GLI's solicitors informed Emerald of those irregularities of which they were aware, claiming that due to the errors in the Notice, unless Emerald sought remedial orders from the Court, that GLI would contend that the offer had closed at 5.00 pm on 8 November 2008. 11 Consequently on the same day, Emerald confirmed to GLI that although it considered that the requirements of s 650D(1) CA had been satisfied it would urgently seek remedial orders. 12 Through its solicitors Emerald wrote to ASX on the same day enclosing a copy of the Notice advising the GLI shareholders about the errors in the incorrect notice and the error in sending the incorrect notice to ASX in the first place.
 I am not persuaded this should be so. 24 It was also submitted that it was inconsistent for Emerald to seek orders reinstating the takeover bid while reserving to itself the right to abandon the takeover bid at any time because of a defeating condition which had already occurred.
 Permitting an extension of the offer for a relatively short period of time subject to the condition that any shareholder be compensated seems to me to preserve the status quo which would have existed but for inadvertent non-compliance. 25 GLI also makes the point that there was a failure on the part of Emerald's solicitors to inform solicitors for GLI of the fundamental deficiency in sending out what was completely the wrong notice by the share registry.
