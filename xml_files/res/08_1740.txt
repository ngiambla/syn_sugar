 In that case his Honour said at [12]: The first ground of the current application perhaps highlights the difficulty for the applicant, namely that there was no evidence or other materials to justify the making of the decision.
 The difficulty faced by the appellant in establishing jurisdictional error in relation to this ground of appeal is that the lack of evidence before the Tribunal was the very reason why the application was dismissed.
 The Court cannot engage in review of the merits of the appellant's case: NAHI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] . 23 In my view the appellant's second ground of appeal is not substantiated. 24 In relation to the appellant's third ground of appeal, the appellant has not provided any particulars to explain this ground or as to why the Tribunal's decision was unreasonable.
