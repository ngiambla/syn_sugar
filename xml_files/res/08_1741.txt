 The appellant told the Tribunal on that day that although the State of Kerala is majority Hindu there are many Muslims where he lives and his wife was "even now having problems". 28 The Tribunal asked the appellant whether he had ever experienced any difficulties in dealing or interacting with Hindus.
 The Tribunal found that the appellant's testimony as to the individuals who had perpetrated the attack upon him on 14 November 2003 and the reasons for the attack were inconsistent with independent country information and "implausible amounting to a fabrication".
