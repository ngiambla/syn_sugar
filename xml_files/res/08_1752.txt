 Mr Ptok and Ms Dean were, in accordance with their Employment Advisor position descriptions, required to perform functions and to provide services under the Employment Services Contract 2006-2009 between WorkDirections Australia and DEWR. 21 There is no basis for Mr Lim's assertion that Mr Ptok and Ms Dean were not so engaged.
 This was the format of the Lim Activity Agreements. 41 The fact that the agreements were signed by employees of WorkDirections Australia, as delegates of the Secretary, does not preclude the agreements being between the Secretary and Mr Lim, despite the fact that the WorkDirections Australia employees did not indicate the source of power to enter into the agreements.
 Nor does it otherwise preclude the agreements being Newstart Activity Agreements within s 605(4). 42 The Lim Activity Agreements are agreements between the person (Mr Lim) and the Secretary for the purposes of ss 605(4) and 624 of the Act.
 The change of Government, in the name of the Department and in the Secretary 43 Mr Lim appears to contend that the change of the party in government, the change in the name and portfolio responsibilities of the Department and the change in the Secretary require fresh delegations.
