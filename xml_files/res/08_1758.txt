 It would be up to Telstra to find any available communications wire to satisfy that request. (2) Request for In-Use ULLS 65 An In-Use ULLS was defined in cl 11.1.1(b) as: "This process covers the provision of a ULLS on an existing Communications Wire currently being utilised by the Customer.
 However, the final determination did not mention either type of In-Use ULLS request; rather it referred only to ULLS transfer and Vacant ULLS requests. 67 As a minimum, an access seeker had to provide the access provider with, among other things, the existing telephone number (the service number) of the subscriber, the subject of the request.
 The Commission also took the view that it was fair and reasonable for the Access Seeker to accept any risk that the copper pair may not be suitable for broadband services. " (emphasis added) 82 The proposal referred to by the Commission was set out in its reasons (at [42]).
 The evidence before the Commission demonstrated that even if Telstra were provided with the telephone number (or FNN) previously associated with the connection indicated by the soft dial tone, it had no records from which it could identify whether that telephone number was associated with an ULLS or other connection.
