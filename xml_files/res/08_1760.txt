 Class 42 Design of computer software; programming maintenance, upgrading and updating of computer software for the legal profession and other industries and professions not limited in any way to a specific industry or commercial sector... 6 The applicant commenced business in 1997 by marketing (primarily to law firms) and licensing a new Family Court document automation software package under the trade mark BING! .
 These activities are not goods and services the subject of the applicant's registered trade mark. 113 Mr Crowe SC submitted that, if the first respondent could not successfully rely on MID Sydney 90 FCR 236 prior to the provision of the undertaking, it could do so following the provision of the undertaking (cf TS 174 ll 28-37).
 As I have already observed, I do not consider that MID Sydney 90 FCR 236 applies because I consider that the software is not "incidental" to the provision of the internet postal service in the sense used in MID Sydney 90 FCR 236 and SAP Australia [1999] FCA 1821 ; 169 ALR 1.
 However if the software provided by the first respondent does not bear the mark "bing", I do not see how the applicant's trade mark is infringed through the first respondent continuing to call itself "bing" in relation to provision of an internet postal service, which (according to Mr Cranitch's affidavit of 12 March 2008) uses a software called "Easymail".
