 Mr Booker has filed evidence to show that the total credit balance of BBPL's bank accounts is very low and that a number of cheques drawn by BBPL were dishonoured.
 Counsel for the Bookers deposed that it was made clear at the mediation Mr Booker was "not prepared to settle unless he was first shown the accounts and given an opportunity to consider whether he was content with them".
 The parties adopted the suggestion and Max Kurz of KE Business Advisory Services Pty Ltd was appointed to value BBPL and find a purchaser for the BBPL shares.
