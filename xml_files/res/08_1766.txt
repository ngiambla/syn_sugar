 Some of that conduct concerns accounting entries and transactions effected by Mr and Mrs Buskens. 10 On a fair reading of the Statement of Claim, Mr and Mrs Buskens are said to be the perpetrators of, or implicated in, most of the conduct which is alleged by the plaintiffs to constitute oppression. 11 No specific allegation of wrongful conduct is made against the third defendant or against its principal, Mr Wood.
 In those circumstances, whilst my attention can and has been drawn to the nature of the allegations made in the balance of the Statement of Claim, the relevant principles must be applied to the one ground of complaint relied upon in the present application, namely, the complaint concerning the payment of the Buskens' legal expenses by the second defendant. 25 In the present case, Counsel for the first and second defendants and the Buskens has submitted that the plaintiffs put a case which implicates the first and second defendants in the events and transactions about which complaint is made and that the Buskens are not the sole or even the principal targets of the plaintiffs.
 As the evidence stands at the moment, there is little to be said for the proposition that the first and second defendants are separately implicated in the complaints made by the plaintiffs so that the second defendant is justified in paying all of the legal costs. 28 It seems to me that there is a serious question to be tried.
