 The Suzlon companies argue that this material gives rise to the inference that some explanation will be needed to establish any innocent association of Mr Sridhar in the execution of the contracts of affreightment and the Suzlon companies' dealings with the Headway companies, and also to establish how Mr Bangad was able to sign in his capacity as an officer of Headway Shipping, while contemporaneously employed by the Suzlon companies.
 Mr den Hartog has subsequently sent a number of emails asserting that he was the victim of misrepresentation in signing a consent to act as a director and did not appreciate that he was not assisting the Suzlon companies, as he thought, but was furthering the interests of those associated with the Headway companies.
 In emails with Mr Bangard of 2 and 3 November 2008, Mr den Hartog asserted that, in May 2008, Mr Bangad represented to Beluga that Headway Shipping was, in effect, a Suzlon subsidiary which had been created to take care of Suzlon's in-house international transport needs. 29 Mr den Hartog asserted that: "The only reason for us [Beluga] to support Headway was because it was guaranteed by Suzlon. " He claimed that, on 1 September 2008, Mr Bangad had asked him to sign --- but not date --- a document making him a director of Headway Shipping.
