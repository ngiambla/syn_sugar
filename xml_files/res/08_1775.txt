 The Exclusivity representation 9 The statements are said to convey a false representation that MSWD's suits are made exclusively for its Walter Withers stores (FASC par 5(b)).
 This is false and misleading and untrue because "the large majority of the suits are not Australian made in any respect but are fully imported from China" (FASC par 8(c)).
 The European Fabrics representation 42 The statements would not convey to a hypothetical ordinary and reasonable purchaser that all suits sold at Walter Withers stores are made from European fabrics.
