 1 Presently before the Court is a Notice of Motion seeking the adjournment of a proceeding set down for hearing on 17, 18 and 19 December 2008. 2 The Applicant on the Motion is the Fourth Respondent in the principal proceeding.
 The dates for final hearing, however, were nevertheless selected with his concurrence and to accommodate his medical condition. 4 On 14 November 2008 the present Applicant on the Motion foreshadowed that he would be seeking a vacation of the December 2008 dates.
 But the joint medical report is dated 2005 and says nothing as to the Applicant's present medical condition. 10 Also annexed to the Applicant's Affidavit was what was said to be notes from the Applicant's psychologist, Ms Tara Stern.
 But such reservations as have been expressed in relation to the medical reports as presently filed are a matter for the Applicant on the Motion to address in such a manner as he sees fit. 20 Even short of again applying for the vacation of the December 2008 hearing dates, the Applicant on the Motion should feel free to make such applications as he sees fit during the course of the final hearing.
