 Supporting the decision of the Tribunal, the respondent contended that, once "2 or more corporations" were identified as satisfying the conditions referred to in par (a), the respondent itself, and the Tribunal on review, were effectively at large in the exercise of their discretion under the section, and might take into account whatever other circumstances appeared to be relevant to the question of disqualification, including the past involvement of the person concerned in the management of other corporations.
 In this respect, the respondent relied particularly upon subpars (i) and (iii) of par (b) of subs (2). 11 Where the respondent has under consideration the exercise of powers under s 206F of the Corporations Act , it is required to give the person concerned "a notice in the prescribed form".
