 Object (2) The object of this section is to preserve the alignment of the head company's costs for membership interests in each entity and its assets by recognising, when an entity ceases to be a subsidiary member of the group, the cost of those interests as an amount equal to the cost of the entity's assets at that time reduced by the amount of its liabilities.
 The step 3 amount is the total, for all liabilities owed by members of the old group to the leaving entity at the leaving time, of the market values of the corresponding assets of the leaving entity (s 711-40(1)); (4) Step 4 --- subtract from the result of step 3 the step 4 amount, which is worked out under s 711- 45 .
 The taxpayer characterized this amount as "the amount discharged at the time [Magazines] ceased to be a subsidiary member of the consolidated group". 40 Both the amounts of $16,934,891 and $9,205,469 were calculated after the liabilities of Magazines to Nominees and Mr Handbury, totalling $26,140,360, were included in step 4 of the calculation of allocable cost amount required by s 711 - 20 .
 The taxpayer submitted that, at the point when Magazines ceased to be a subsidiary member of the consolidated group, it also ceased to be indebted to Nominees and Mr Handbury and, therefore, those debts were not "a liability of the leaving entity at the leaving time that can or must be identified in the entity's statement of financial position".
