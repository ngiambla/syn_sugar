 The Federal Magistrate obviously accepted the symptoms were such that the appellant could not attend the hearing. 18 Assuming there to be an evidentiary onus on the appellant to prove the reason for the non-attendance, I do not accept that this could only be proved before the Federal Magistrate by the provision of medical evidence to the Court.
 See, for instance, Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [37] . 27 Therefore, the operative decision of the Tribunal on 31 May 2008 occurred after the appellant was given the opportunity to explain her absence at the original hearing, to provide any further material in support of her application, and after the Tribunal exercised its discretion to proceed despite being aware that the appellant was sick on the original scheduled hearing date.
 The Tribunal was entitled to reject the explanation for non-attendance. 35 In my view, the Tribunal's decision to proceed under s 426A was not capricious, nor did it fail to take into account the material submitted to it: see NBBL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 1045 ; (2006) 152 FCR 592 , 598 at [21].
