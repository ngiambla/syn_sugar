 It involved claims by the Suzlon companies that there may have been irregularities in the negotiation of the contracts of affreightment and some other chartering arrangements, including those for the MV Beluga Fantastic shipment. 4 The arrangement between Suzlon Energy and Headway Shipping for the MV Beluga Fantastic shipment appeared to require the issue of non-negotiable freight prepaid bills of lading, naming Suzlon Energy Australia as consignee.
 Upon the confirmation of those payments, the Headway companies would release or deliver or cause to be delivered to the Suzlon companies, first, the original bills of lading for the cargo then held by the Sheriff, secondly, bills of lading for another cargo withheld from Suzlon companies in the United States of America and, thirdly, bills of lading for cargo currently being carried on board the MV Beluga Revolution , which I infer is a sister ship of the plaintiff's ship. 6 Yesterday, all the parties considered that the original bills of lading for the cargo held by the Sheriff would be available to be handed to the Sheriff in accordance with the orders which they had asked the Court to make.
 They contended that it followed that there was no practical risk that any intervening third party could acquire some interest in or title to the bills or, indeed, could acquire one or more of the original bills so as to be able to present them to the Sheriff after he had parted with possession of the goods.
