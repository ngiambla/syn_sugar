 I comment further on the undertaking below. 14 (ix) On 5 July 2007, the Commission raised with Harbin its concern that the Strikethrough Price in the Advertisement was higher than the price at which the barbecue had been offered for sale immediately prior to 29 March 2007.
 The only proper inference to be drawn as to how the error in the pricing representation found its way into the advertisement is that it was facilitated by a system's defect (the absence of effective line of responsibility for pricing representations) which produced an inadequate check on the potential for human error in making pricing representations.
