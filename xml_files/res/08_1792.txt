 I comment further on the undertaking below. 14 (ix) On 5 July 2007, the Commission raised with Harbin its concern that the Strikethrough Price in the Advertisement was higher than the price at which the barbecue had been offered for sale immediately prior to 29 March 2007.
 On 10 July 2007, Harbin acknowledged and agreed with the Commission that it had not offered the barbecue for sale at the Strikethrough Price immediately prior to 29 March 2007. 15 (x) At the time of publication of the Advertisement, a range of people within Harbin were responsible for the creation, sign-off and publication of the Advertisement including procurement personnel and the advertising department.
 The only proper inference to be drawn as to how the error in the pricing representation found its way into the advertisement is that it was facilitated by a system's defect (the absence of effective line of responsibility for pricing representations) which produced an inadequate check on the potential for human error in making pricing representations.
 Ancillary orders regarding the implementation of review recommendations etc are proposed. 33 Given there is a compliance program already in place pursuant to the 2004 s 87B undertaking and that that program is subject to independent, annual audits which are to be conducted in accordance with prescribed procedures leading to a report to be furnished to the ACCC, I intend to do no more than direct that a copy of my reasons and orders be served by Harbin on the independent auditor and that the ACCC be given written notification of that service within 14 days of such service.
