 In determining the matter, the Board is directed by the legislature that a disqualifying factor for a person not being the prescribed fit and proper person is, relevantly, if the person is not of 'good fame, integrity and character': s 251BC(1)(d).
 This appeal does not require a consideration of the elements of whether or not a person is the prescribed fit and proper person, although the generality of the phrase 'good fame, integrity and character' is not to be limited by reference to whether the applicant has certain disqualifying convictions or is under sentence of imprisonment (see s 251BC(2) of the Act).
 It may well be that a particular conviction (other than a disqualifying conviction) is to be taken into account and not 'disregarded', but that, for one reason or another, taking into account all the circumstances, the Board may still be satisfied that the applicant is the prescribed fit and proper person.
