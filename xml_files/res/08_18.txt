 It would be improper, it was said, for the Commissioner to resort to the personal duress occasioned by a DPO when he knew that the person was unable to pay tax directly, and for the purpose of compelling persons or entities other than the taxpayer to do so.
 Had the applicant been concerned to challenge Mr Trewin's decision under subs (1), a submission that, in considering whether the liabilities were completely irrecoverable, he instructed himself by reference to the matter of recoverability from persons other than the applicant, would have been intelligible (whether or not well founded).
 In such a case --- which is the present case --- it is very difficult to see how the applicant could, absent explicit indications of bad purpose, weave into his attack an allegation that Mr Trewin's refusal to revoke was based upon an ulterior purpose of the kind suggested.
 However, the allegation has been made, and the applicant's point must be considered. 39 On the facts of the present case, I could not find that the actual purpose of Mr Trewin was to have persons other than the applicant pay his tax liabilities.
