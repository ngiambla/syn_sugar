 One of them is from China and purports to be from Ms Ciu's husband, and both support the claim that [the first appellant] gave them material to take back. [The first appellant's] friend Ms Cui stated that he has since told her that she carried some Falungong-related material into China for [the first appellant] in 2001.
 Nor is it inconsistent with the finding that the Tribunal was: ... satisfied that their reasons for leaving [China], and for lodging the protection visa applications in 2002, are unrelated to involvement in Falungong. 45 The first appellant claimed that his Falun Gong practice in Australia commenced some 19 months before his initial application for a protection visa.
 That claimed conduct on the part of the first appellant did not, and does not, engage s 91R(3) because the Tribunal found, as a finding of fact, that that conduct had not happened. 52 The same reasoning informs the Tribunal's conclusion that the first appellant's practice of Falun Gong in Australia "did not happen" prior to the initial application.
 Further, the Tribunal was not satisfied by the first appellant that his practice of Falun Gong in Australia (which occurred after the initial written submissions to the Department) was engaged in other than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Convention.
