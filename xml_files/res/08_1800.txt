 Nor is it inconsistent with the finding that the Tribunal was: ... satisfied that their reasons for leaving [China], and for lodging the protection visa applications in 2002, are unrelated to involvement in Falungong. 45 The first appellant claimed that his Falun Gong practice in Australia commenced some 19 months before his initial application for a protection visa.
 That claimed conduct on the part of the first appellant did not, and does not, engage s 91R(3) because the Tribunal found, as a finding of fact, that that conduct had not happened. 52 The same reasoning informs the Tribunal's conclusion that the first appellant's practice of Falun Gong in Australia "did not happen" prior to the initial application.
