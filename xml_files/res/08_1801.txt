 The significant consideration is not that there was a profit in that month, but whether there was a profit of sufficient significance in what was assumed by both experts to be the major trading month for a business such as that of Damilock.
 Anticipated profit was also necessary to convert the projected balance sheet (in fact, an incorrect balance sheet as it proceeds from net assets at 31 December 2006 of $527,565) shortfall to surplus net assets of $268,727 contemplated that level of net profit.
 I have had regard to the various points made in its submissions. 98 In my judgment, despite the matters raised by the creditor, the evidence points firmly to the conclusion that Damilock was insolvent at 26 December 2007 (and 31 December 2007), and remained so during the relation-back period.
 There is sufficient in the comparison of the picture at 30 June 2006 and 31 December 2006 of the state of affairs of Damilock, together with such information as there was of the intervening period of six months, to confirm that conclusion.
