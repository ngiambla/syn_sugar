 The appellant was advised that the Tribunal had decided that he was not entitled to a protection visa. 10 The appellant filed an Application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia on 28 March 2008 seeking constitutional writ relief in respect of the decision of the Tribunal.
 He also submitted that the Tribunal failed to afford the appellant a fair hearing by reason of the Tribunal's failure to inquire into the authenticity of the Singapore article, given its potential to corroborate the appellant's claim and given the great lengths the Tribunal went to in discrediting the authenticity of all other documents emanating from Bangladesh, predominantly because of high incidences of document fraud and forgery.
