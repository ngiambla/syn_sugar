 Mr Fahnle appeared not to be aware that Vaughan had commissioned and obtained a "Baseline Soil Assessment" report for the site in June 2005, in accordance with its usual practice. 7 Mr Fahnle said that he gave the organisers the names of the workers on site, including Ms Belcher.
 Insofar as there was a ban on work at the site, it did not apply to concreting work after 8.00 am on 21 October 2005 or to earthworks on site from the afternoon of 21 October 2005.
 Section 37 defines "unlawful industrial action" as action which is industrially motivated, constitutionally connected and is not excluded. 23 The Union did, through the organisers, engage in such industrial action, by imposing bans (albeit limited and short-lived ones).
 Accordingly, the Court finds that on 20 October 2005, the respondent, through its organisers, engaged in unlawful industrial action at the University Hill site, in breach of s 38 of the Act .
