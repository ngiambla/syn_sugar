 By this offer, Redberry offered to compromise the claim and cross-claim on the basis that: (1) Redberry would pay the sum of $20,000 to the applicants/cross-respondents, plus costs as taxed or agreed; (2) the payment would be made within 28 days after acceptance of the offer; and (3) the offer would be open for acceptance for 14 days beginning on the day after service of the notice.
 The effect of Redberry's letter of 21 August 2007 and the accompanying offer of compromise is that there were two offers: (a) an offer to settle the applicants' claim by payment of $20,000 plus party/party costs of the claim; and (b) an offer to dismiss the cross-claim and pay the applicants' party/party costs of the cross-claim. 2.
 The fact that the proceeding was one of the first under the new Designs Act was no justification in rejecting the reasonable commercial offers of settlement. 15 Furthermore, Redberry relied on the terms of the offer of compromise of 21 August 2007 and O 23 of the Rules in support of its claim for indemnity costs in respect of the claim and cross-claim.
