 It seemed to me that, because the applicant is a child, now six and a half years old, and because he has a number of intellectual disabilities, it was necessary for the Court to do more than simply to consent to the proposed orders. 3 By O 43, r 12 of the Federal Court Rules , the Court has power to approve settlement of a proceeding brought by a person under a disability on terms.
 The confidentiality of the terms of settlement would be difficult to preserve if the Court were to make an order that the first respondent pay into court the amount of the settlement, and to make an order that the first respondent pay the applicant's costs of the proceeding.
 The applicant's next friend and the applicant's mother have both signed written undertakings, directed to the first respondent, not to reveal the terms of settlement, other than in certain defined circumstances.
