 I subsequently ordered that Black Decker's costs be the subject of a gross sum order under O 62 r 4(2)(c) and (d) of the Federal Court Rules : Black Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 4) [2008] FCA 1737. 2 For this exercise the Court appointed Ms Margaret Gourlay of the Law Institute of Victoria's Costing Service as a court expert under O 34.
 Under O 62 r 36A where a party is awarded judgment for less than $100,000 for a money sum or damages any costs ordered to be paid will be "reduced by one-third of the amount otherwise allowable under this Order unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders".
 There was substantial expert evidence and no less than 45 pieces of prior art advanced at various times by the respondent. 9 Practically speaking, Black Decker had no alternative to commencing this proceeding in the Federal Court or some other "prescribed court" --- i.e. the Supreme Court of a State or Territory; see Patents Act 1990 (Cth) s 120(1) and the definition of "prescribed court" in Sch 1.
