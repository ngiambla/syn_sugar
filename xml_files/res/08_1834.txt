 The expression "financial supply", which is important for the purpose of the concept of an input taxed supply (see below) and for the present case, is defined in s 195- 1 to have the meaning given by the regulations made for the purposes of s 40- 5 (2).
 The proviso merely acknowledges the possibility that some taxable supplies may to some extent be GST-free supplies and/or input taxed supplies. 100 However, the word "supply" in s 9 - 5 bears the meaning given to it by s 9 - 10 and therefore includes a financial supply (s 9 - 10 (2)(f)) which is a particular species of input taxed supply (s 40 - 5 (1)).
 The expression "the acquisition relates to supplies that would be input taxed" in para (a) of s11-15(2) is likewise objective: it refers to a relatedness as a matter of objective fact between an acquisition and a supply. 125 The Act provides in subss (3) and (4) of s 11-15 for circumstances in which an acquisition that would otherwise be related to making supplies that would be input taxed is not to be treated as such.
