 This meant that the extra cost to the Labour Hire Companies would be passed on to Zinifex. 10 As a result of the TIC decision, and with the knowledge and approval of Zinifex, the Labour Hire Companies decided to invite employees engaged in the Smelter to enter into AWAs. 11 On 9 December 2005 a discussion took place at the Smelter between, on the one hand, Mr Mark Emmett, who was the Superintendent of Electrolysis at the Smelter, and, on the other hand, Labour Hire Companies' employees Geoffrey Holmes, Shaun Russell and David Scurrah.
 Mr Emmett was aware that some labour hire workers had signed AWAs and some had not, and there were enough employees who had signed AWAs to take the place of the non-AWA labour hire employees. 12 Mr Scurrah signed the TESA AWA immediately after the meeting.
