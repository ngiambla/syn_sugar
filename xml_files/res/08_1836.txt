 However, the Zinifex Agreement had not yet been recognised by the TIC as binding on the Labour Hire Companies or their employees at the Smelter. 7 By a decision of the TIC made on 21 September 2005 (and subsequently affirmed on appeal) the TIC determined that the Labour Hire Companies were bound by the Zinifex Award in relation to employees working at the Smelter. 8 Prior to the TIC decision Labour Hire Companies employees at the Smelter would generally work a rotating roster of four days on --- four days off with a twelve hour shift on each day worked.
 This meant that the extra cost to the Labour Hire Companies would be passed on to Zinifex. 10 As a result of the TIC decision, and with the knowledge and approval of Zinifex, the Labour Hire Companies decided to invite employees engaged in the Smelter to enter into AWAs. 11 On 9 December 2005 a discussion took place at the Smelter between, on the one hand, Mr Mark Emmett, who was the Superintendent of Electrolysis at the Smelter, and, on the other hand, Labour Hire Companies' employees Geoffrey Holmes, Shaun Russell and David Scurrah.
 Mr Emmett was aware that some labour hire workers had signed AWAs and some had not, and there were enough employees who had signed AWAs to take the place of the non-AWA labour hire employees. 12 Mr Scurrah signed the TESA AWA immediately after the meeting.
 In the circumstances it was reasonable to expect that Zinifex would provide Mr Emmett with guidance about what was and what was not acceptable conduct in relation to dealing with Zinifex concerns about the cost implication of any response by the Labour Hire Companies to the TIC decision.
