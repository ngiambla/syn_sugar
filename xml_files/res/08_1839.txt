 These are the reasons why I made those orders. 3 Full details of the Share Scheme, the SAINTS Scheme and the Options Scheme were contained in helpful written submissions which were provided to me by Senior Counsel for St George, Mr Jackman SC, prior to the first court hearing on 29 September 2008.
 The most recent case is Re APN News Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 at [23] . 6 I was satisfied that the "performance risk" was sufficiently addressed in relation to each of the Schemes for the reasons set out in the written submissions. 7 The second matter to which reference was made was an exclusivity provision contained in clause 19 of the Merger Implementation Agreement.
 This contained a "no shop restriction", a "no talk restriction" and a "no due diligence restriction". 8 Each of the concerns in relation to exclusivity clauses expressed by Santow J in Re Arthur Yates Co Ltd [2001] NSWSC 40 ; (2001) 36 ACSR 758 at [9] was addressed in the written submissions. 9 The third issue to which Mr Jackman referred was the question of a break fee of $100 million provided for in cl 20.2 of the Merger Implementation Agreement. 10 I was satisfied that the break fee provision did not offend the principles stated in the authorities including Re SFE Corporation Ltd [2006] FCA 670 at [6] --- [7]. 11 The fourth issue was the deemed warranty in cl 4.5 of the Share Scheme that the shares be free from encumbrances.
