 Claber is the supplier with whom Nylex has contracted for the supply of the new range of Nylex branded products. 14 In the Application filed with the Statement of Claim, Gardena seeks an order that Nylex specifically perform its obligations under the Distribution Agreement and a permanent injunction restraining Nylex until 31 December 2008 from manufacturing, distributing or selling products in competition with Gardena products (other than those products which it is permitted to sell on its own account under the Distribution Agreement).
 Gardena also claims damages, interest and costs. 15 Gardena's claim for interlocutory relief was confined to a claim for an injunction restraining Nylex until 31 December 2008 from continuing to market and sell in Australia or New Zealand Nylex branded garden products which are not supplied by Gardena and which are being marketed and sold by Nylex in competition with the Gardena products which Nylex was and is obliged to distribute in those countries in accordance with its obligations under the Distribution Agreement.
 The damage caused by either a three month gap in supply of GARDENA products, or by Nylex Claber products having a three month head start, in my opinion based on my experience in retail and in product distribution, would persist for years and make it very difficult for Gardena to re-establish itself in the market. 83 Gardena wants to maintain the value of the Gardena brand.
