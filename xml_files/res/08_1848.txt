 1 I have before me an urgent application for leave to appeal against the decision of Burnett FM pursuant to s 24(1)(d) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and a notice of motion relating to that application.
 I understand from submissions of Counsel for the trustee in bankruptcy that, after the trustee in bankruptcy was joined as a party to the Supreme Court proceedings by order of the Court, there was commonality between the parties to the Supreme Court proceedings and the parties to the substantive proceedings.
 The joinder of the trustee in bankruptcy to the Supreme Court proceedings is not in dispute. 7 The application brought by Ms George before his Honour for a stay of the substantive proceedings was listed for hearing before his Honour on 18 November 2008.
 His Honour referred to Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 172 as authority for the proposition that contests concerning matters within s 31 Bankruptcy Act fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts.
