 I understand from submissions of Counsel for the trustee in bankruptcy that, after the trustee in bankruptcy was joined as a party to the Supreme Court proceedings by order of the Court, there was commonality between the parties to the Supreme Court proceedings and the parties to the substantive proceedings.
 The joinder of the trustee in bankruptcy to the Supreme Court proceedings is not in dispute. 7 The application brought by Ms George before his Honour for a stay of the substantive proceedings was listed for hearing before his Honour on 18 November 2008.
