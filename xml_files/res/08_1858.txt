 The advocate passed this information onto Mr Goulding and, as a consequence, he did not provide a statement in response to the s 155AA notice. 6 Section 155AA(5) of the Veterans' Act provides that if the applicant does not provide a written statement in response to the s 155AA notice within 28 days, the principal member must dismiss the review application and notify the applicant accordingly.
 Finally, it correctly decided that, in contrast, s 28A of the Acts Interpretation Act applied to the service of documents, which included giving a notice and it was therefore the apposite provision of the two provisions put forward, for giving a written notice under s 155AA(4) of the Veterans' Act. 19 Conversely, from my reading of the Tribunal's decision, I do not consider it expressed, or even implied, the conclusion that s 28A of the Acts Interpretation Act was a mandatory provision, or that a s 155AA notice must be given in accordance with that section.
 The third question of law 25 The third and final question of law set out in the Commission's notice of appeal falls into a different category i.e. it does not rely upon the Tribunal's decision at all, but rather relies upon a submission that the Commission says the Tribunal did not decide, and should have.
 To make the link between the presumed receipt of the notice and the process of giving or serving of the notice under s 155AA, I consider the Commission needs to show that the Board has either complied with ss 29 and 28A of the Acts Interpretation Act , or some other similar provision that creates a presumption that service is effected if certain steps are taken.
