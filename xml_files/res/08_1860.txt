 1 The Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") commenced an action alleging that six related companies (the "Australvic group") and Michael Kyriackou (an ex-director of several of the companies) were operating a managed investment scheme which was required to be, but was not, registered under Pt 5C.1 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
 Third, ASIC does not wish to incur the disproportionate costs that would be involved in a trial dealing with only the fourth and seventh defendants. 3 Order 22 of the Federal Court Rules requires ASIC to obtain leave to discontinue the action.
 What is in issue is whether ASIC must pay Mr Kyriackou's costs of the proceeding to date. 4 For this purpose, Mr Kyriackou served ASIC with a notice to produce which, in substance, calls for the production of all ASIC files brought into existence since the investigation into the Australvic group commenced.
