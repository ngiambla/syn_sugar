 Federal Magistrate Driver said that the application faced two potential jurisdictional problems. 4 First, Cowdroy J had found that the Tribunal's ultimate finding was free from jurisdictional error and the High Court had found insufficient prospects of success to justify the granting of special leave.
 This ground constitutes an attempt to relitigate the Tribunal decision. 9 An attempt to relitigate matters and decisions that have been the subject of litigation and consideration up to the High Court is an abuse of the process of the Court and vexatious and oppressive: SZCNP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 216 ; SZBPB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 164 ; MZXOW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] HCASL 73.
