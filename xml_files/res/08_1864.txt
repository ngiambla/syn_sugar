 A further particular of his ground of appeal is that Raphael FM failed to conduct a complete investigation into whether or not his second migration agent fulfilled his duty as legal representative. 4 The appellant's evidence before Raphael FM was that his first migration agent, Mr Shi, had concocted his protection visa claims.
 The Tribunal did not accept that the adverse consequences there described were so serious as to amount to persecution. 6 The appellant says that he told the Federal Magistrate that when he was told of the decision of the Tribunal in May 2000, he was advised by Mr Shi that he could do nothing more.
 His Honour put to the appellant that he found it difficult to believe that, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant knew there was a discrepancy between his claims and what the first migration agent had stated, the second migration agent nonetheless repeated what the appellant described as the lies of the first migration agent. 8 The explanation given by the appellant was that the second migration agent just transferred the information from the first migration agent's files.
