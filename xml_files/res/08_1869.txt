 Circumstances potentially giving rise to trade mark infringement also potentially give rise to claims of misleading and deceptive conduct and passing off. 19 Second, and following on from this point, I agree with the applicant that the factual and evidentiary matrix in support of the TPA and passing off claims was the same in these proceedings as that in respect of the trade mark infringement claim.
 No separate evidence was lead in relation to the failed TPA and passing off claims. 20 Third, the parties have not quantified the time and effort spent specifically on preparing and meeting the TPA and passing off claim of the applicant as distinct from the trade mark infringement claim.
 In relation to this issue, Mr Crowe SC submitted (in summary) that the relevance of such history in a matter is minimal because otherwise no party could ever succeed at the end of the trial in having costs apportioned by the Court where there has been partial success and partial failure of claims (TS 15 ll 35-38).
