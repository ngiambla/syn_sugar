 A declaration pursuant to s 16(3)(b) ADJR Act and/or s 21 Federal Court Act that the respondent must decide pursuant to s 75 EPBC Act: a. whether the proposed action the subject of the Referral is a controlled action; and b. which provisions of Pt 3 (if any) of the EPBC Act are controlling provisions for the proposed action the subject of the Referral. 5.
 An order pursuant to s 16(3)(a) ADJR Act directing the Minister to decide pursuant to s 75 EPBC Act: a. whether the proposed action the subject of the Referral is a controlled action; and b. which provisions of Pt 3 (if any) of the EPBC Act are controlling provisions for the proposed action the subject of the Referral. 6.
 An order pursuant to s 39B Judiciary Act for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing that the Minister decide pursuant to s 75 EPBC Act: a. whether the proposed action the subject of the Referral is a controlled action; and b. which provisions of Pt 3 (if any) of the EPBC Act are controlling provisions for the proposed action the subject of the Referral. 7.
 That the failure of the Minister to comply with a time limit set by the EPBC Act does not affect its validity is clear not only in relation to any action of the Minister under the Act as a whole (s 518(1)), but, in my view crucially, is clear in relation to any decision made by the Minister under Ch 4 EPBC Act (s 156(3)).
