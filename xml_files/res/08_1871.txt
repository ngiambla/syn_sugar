 The question is whether the expenditure incurred was reflected in a part of the asset disposed of, that is to say in those features or attributes of the asset that may be described as its 'state' or 'nature'. 28 It was contended by the Commissioner that, in the case of expenditure incurred in relation to shares in a company, it is the bundle of rights attaching to the shares in which the expenditure must be reflected.
 Therefore, neither the 'state' nor 'nature' of the shares changed as a result of the capital expenditure. 30 The taxpayer rejected this approach taken by the Commissioner, and focused upon the ordinary meaning to be given to the words in the Act of 'state' or 'nature', the purpose of the capital gains tax provisions in the Act, and the nature and state of a share, to urge upon the Court the construction it contend for in this proceeding.
 More particularly, the taxpayer submitted that on the facts the condition of the shares had been improved or enhanced by the expenditure, in that the value of the taxpayer's rights in NMUK had been improved or enhanced, and the benefit of that expenditure remained reflected in the state or nature of the share at the time of its disposal. 31 The taxpayer did not just rely upon the fact of an increase in the embedded value of the shares.
 The Tribunal rejects the proposition that any causal link between the incentive payments and the listing of the issued shares in the new company makes the state or nature of the applicant's shares in that company reflective of the amount of the incentive payments for the purposes of ss 160 ZH(1)(c) and (2)(c) of the ITAA 1936.
