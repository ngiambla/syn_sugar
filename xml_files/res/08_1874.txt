 At the time of the termination, the Taxpayer had been on secondment in Tokyo, Japan with Deutsche Securities Limited ( Deutsche Securities ), a company related to Deutsche Australia. 4 The payment made to the Taxpayer on 1 May 2003 was the sum of $535,068.03.
 The Tribunal considered, therefore, that the character of the Redundancy Payment in the Taxpayer's hands would depend on all the surrounding circumstances. 27 The Tribunal found that the Redundancy Payment compensated the Taxpayer for the termination of his position with Deutsche Australia at least in part.
 The Tribunal observed that, as set out in the Deed of Release, the calculation of the Redundancy Payment was based on 14 months' salary, being 3 months' salary in lieu of notice and an additional payment in accordance with Deutsche Australia's redundancy guidelines.
 However, the Tribunal did not consider that that automatically meant that the payment was made for the purpose of compensating the Taxpayer for the loss of the employment in Tokyo. 32 The Tribunal found that the Redundancy Payment compensated the Taxpayer for the loss of his employment at Deutsche Australia, including the loss of his contractual entitlement to resume work with Deutsche Australia in Australia when his secondment to Deutsche Securities ended.
