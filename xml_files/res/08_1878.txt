 Section 44 provides that a party to a proceeding before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding.
 As noted, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed the decision on 27 February 2008. 6 There are two primary difficulties for the appellant in the present appeal. 7 First, the decision under review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was the decision with respect to the recovery of $32,161.47, being compensation affected payments.
 However, it is clear from the documents relied upon by the Tribunal that the Workers Compensation Commission made a determination on 4 May 2006 (the decision the appellant identifies as relevant in the notice of appeal) and 27 July 2006 which was subject to appeal insofar as the refusal of the claim for psychological impairment was concerned.
 Factual matters are within the discretion of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 12 Insofar as the appellant said that he had not had an opportunity to present all of his evidence to this Court, I note that the appeal was fixed for hearing on 9 September 2008.
