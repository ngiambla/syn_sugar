 1 This is an application for leave to extend time to file and serve a notice of appeal against a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of 10 September 2007 ( SZKPX v Minister for Immigration Anor [2007] FMCA 1597). 2 Order 52 rule 15(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules provides that a notice of appeal is to be filed within 21 days of the date on which the judgment appealed from was pronounced.
 However, under order 52 rule 15(2) the Court for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal. 3 The applicant filed the application for an extension of time on 6 November 2008.
 When taken into detention the applicant was told that an application could be made for an exemption from Court fees. 4 The applicant's draft notice of appeal claims that the applicant's migration agent misled the applicant so that he did not attend the hearing and present evidence.
 The primary judge noted that the applicant had personally consented to the hearing taking place in his absence with the consequence that no jurisdictional error could be found. 5 The Full Court of the Federal Court explained the meaning of "special reasons" in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195 as follows: ...the expression 'special reasons' is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days.
