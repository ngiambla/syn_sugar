 The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the appeal on 30 September 2008. 4 In his application to the Federal Magistrates Court the appellant identified one ground of appeal, namely that the Tribunal's decision remained "constructively unexercised" as it was influenced by the fraud of the appellant's migration agent.
 This appeal ground was particularised as follows: - (i) the migration agent failed to include details of the appellant's persecution in his original application for a protection visa, (ii) the appellant's application to the Tribunal lodged by the migration agent contained serious errors, and (iii) the migration agent failed to inform the appellant of the progress of his application, the decision of the Minister's delegate, or the Tribunal's invitation to attend a hearing. 5 The appellant did not appear at the Tribunal hearing.
