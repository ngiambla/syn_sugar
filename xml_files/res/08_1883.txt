 Section 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provides that an appeal shall not be brought from an interlocutory judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal. 2 The appellant filed the application for leave to appeal on 24 October 2008.
 The first respondent submitted that the application should be dismissed by reason of the appellant's default in not prosecuting the appeal or filing submissions as required (Order 35A rr 2 and 3 of the Federal Court Rules ) and because the proceedings were vexatious, frivolous and an abuse of process (Order 20 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ).
 The primary judge dismissed the application because the appellant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings and the application was an abuse of process because it sought to re-agitate a decision that had already been made and upheld on appeal. 7 I agree with the primary judge and am thus not satisfied that leave to appeal should be granted.
