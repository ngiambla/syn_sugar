 Consistent with the analysis of authorities in SZGAP v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs (2005) 227 ALR 683 ; [2005] FCA 1785 , summary dismissal of an appeal, without any final adjudication on the merits, is an interlocutory rather than a final decision.
 The application is accompanied by an affidavit stating that the primary judge did not consider the appellant's application and that the appellant was not legally represented at the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court. 3 The appellant's draft notice of appeal specifies two appeal grounds, namely: - (i) the primary judge "failed to find error of law, jurisdictional error, procedural fairness and relief under [s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)]", and (ii) the primary judge dismissed the application without considering the legal and factual errors made by the Refugee Review Tribunal.
 The second would be whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision to be wrong ( Dcor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397).
