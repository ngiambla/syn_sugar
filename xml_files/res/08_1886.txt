 Section 147-1 merely informs the reader that Div 147 is "about" a requirement on the part of "representatives" of "incapacitated entities" to register. 39 A convoluted definitional path that commences with s 195-1 of the GST Act and ends with s 6(1) of the Income tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) establishes that the liquidator of a company is one of those who is a "representative".
 Absent the making of a "taxable supply" there is no liability to GST when a "supply" is made. 55 To note this particular absence of s 9-5 reference quality in Div 147 is to note a resemblance between the provision in s 147-5 of the GST Act for the registration of representatives of incapacitated persons and the position which prevailed under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (NZ) (the NZ GST Act) as originally enacted.
