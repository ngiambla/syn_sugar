 While she may have suffered some discrimination in that the children have to pay school fees and health care fees this has not affected her capacity to subsist or to earn a livelihood, as these fees are being paid for by others and her daughter has been able to obtain an overseas paid education.
 The Federal Magistrate also said that the appellant gave "evidence...about her daughter's study in Australia which comes under the exception in s 424A(3)(b)". 28 Thirdly, the appellant contended that the Tribunal had failed to consider the appellant's daughter's evidence properly and failed to consider photographs submitted by the appellant.
 Accordingly, this ground of appeal succeeds. 43 As to the ground of appeal based on the first ground of review, in my view, the Federal Magistrate did not err in concluding that the Tribunal did not seek to embark upon the process provided for in s 424AA.
