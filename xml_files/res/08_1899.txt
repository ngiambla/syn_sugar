 Cultivaust Pty Ltd v Grain Pool Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1568 at [40] ; Wilderness Society Inc v Hon Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for Environment and Water Resources [2008] FCAFC 19 at [6] ; Lowe v Mack Trucks Australia Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 711 at [5] and Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority v Administrative Appeals Tribunal (No 2) [2008] FCA 1672 at [3] - [4] and [24]). 5 In the present case I do not need to respond to any invitation or suggestion to depart from the approach approved in Vadarlis .
 I am satisfied that there are special circumstances in the present case justifying a departure from the tradition rule that ordinarily costs follow the event. 6 It will be apparent from my earlier judgment ( Phosphate Resources Ltd v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1521) that the applicant ("PRL") failed upon the case which it initially brought to trial.
 Had the case gone forward on the basis of pleadings, and had PRL sought and been granted leave to supplement its case at such a late stage in the proceedings as occurred in this case, there seems little doubt that it would only have been permitted to do so in return for some protection of the respondent on the question of costs.
 The respondent was, of course, entitled to maintain its opposition to the application even after the emerging crystallisation of the matters to which I drew attention in the earlier judgment, such as the nature and content of the advice which had been provided prior to the decision made on 27 April 2007, but in my view, PRL is entitled to some compensation for its costs as a result of ultimately succeeding in its application.
