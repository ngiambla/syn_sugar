 Background 7 It is now to be taken that Senior Member Allen decided that a reviewable decision should be set aside and that the respondent was liable, pursuant to s 14 of the SRC Act, for a temporary exacerbation of symptoms caused by cervical spondylosis suffered by the applicant. 8 In his reasons for his decision that each party should pay its own costs, the Senior Member referred to a letter from the respondent to the applicant dated 15 August 2006.
 The Senior Member considered that the letter of offer in this matter satisfied the criteria set out in Perry 150 FCR at 327, 333-5, that it be clear, precise and certain, particularly with respect to the question of costs. 10 However, the Senior Member was of the opinion that the agreement proposed by the letter, which was to be the basis for a proposed consent decision of the Tribunal, did not constitute a decision open to the Tribunal to make.
 Whether, in exercising the discretion, if conferred upon it, the Court might have taken a different view about the allocation of costs or circumstances influencing whether the respondent might be ordered to pay the costs or a part of the costs, is not to the point.
