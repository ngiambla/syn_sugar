 Greenwood J in Perry v Comcare [2006] FCA 33 ; (2006) 150 FCR 319 at [65] - [66] made the following observations: The provisions of s 67 "constitute a code in the area of costs": Riley v Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees (1994) 48 FCR 449 per Beaumont J.
 Senior Member Allen then directed the Registrar of the Tribunal to alter the decision such that it now expressly states that the decision under review was set aside and a decision favourable to the applicant was made in substitution. 6 All that now remains in this appeal is to determine whether the Senior Member committed any error of law adverse to the applicant in the exercise of his discretion as to costs.
 Background 7 It is now to be taken that Senior Member Allen decided that a reviewable decision should be set aside and that the respondent was liable, pursuant to s 14 of the SRC Act, for a temporary exacerbation of symptoms caused by cervical spondylosis suffered by the applicant. 8 In his reasons for his decision that each party should pay its own costs, the Senior Member referred to a letter from the respondent to the applicant dated 15 August 2006.
 The respondent was prepared to concede that the applicant had suffered an aggravation of an existing condition, and that he was entitled to compensation under ss 16 and 19 of the SRC Act, but only from 27 April 2005 to 8 June 2005 (in reliance on a medical report of Dr Olsen, which stated that any aggravation was temporary).
 Whether, in exercising the discretion, if conferred upon it, the Court might have taken a different view about the allocation of costs or circumstances influencing whether the respondent might be ordered to pay the costs or a part of the costs, is not to the point.
