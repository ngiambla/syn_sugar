 Mandatory injunctions (4) If a person has refused or failed, or is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail to do an act, and the refusal or failure did, does or would constitute an offence or other contravention of this Act or the regulations, the Court may grant an injunction requiring the person to do the act. ...
 Section 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) has, from the very commencement of that Act well over 30 years ago, permitted either an emanation of the Commonwealth in the form of what is now called the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) or any other person to institute proceedings for injunctive relief grounded in a finding of a contravention of Pt IV or Pt V of that Act.
 That there exists a theoretical contingency that a respondent's conduct may at the behest of the ACCC attract a civil penalty proceeding or a prosecution has not in the past proved to be a fertile source of precedent in relation to the staying of proceedings for injunctive relief under the Trade Practices Act initiated by a private person.
 An analogous conclusion is open in respect of the proceedings by private persons for injunctions grounded upon a breach of State fair trading statutes. 36 The EPBC Act does, by Subdivision B of Div 15 of Pt 17 of ch 6 (ss 486A to 486D) make some provision with respect to the relationship between criminal and civil penalty proceedings under that Act.
