 Thereupon, on 26 March 2008, the first to eighth respondents filed and served an Amended Notice of Motion seeking summary dismissal or an Order striking out parts of the Amended Statement of Claim. 6 On 1 April 2008 the ninth respondent filed a similar Notice of Motion but also claimed Security for Costs.
 The hearing on 21 November 2008 was conducted by reference to that Further Amended Statement of Claim. 7 On 28 May 2008 I made orders pursuant to the application for summary judgment by Baldwin Shelston and struck out the pleadings in relation to the conspiracy claim in the Trade Practice claim.
 The ninth respondent pressed its application for summary judgment and strike out of parts of the Further Amended Statement of Claim. 12 When the matter came on before me for hearing Mr Hasson applied for an adjournment on the basis that his Counsel was otherwise engaged and that he had only been served with the documents on or about 17 November 2008.
 The response of 19 August 2008 was that the fist eight respondents would be prepared to consent to Orders staying the second applicant's proceedings subject to the second applicant paying security for costs and that if the security had not been paid by 16 September 2008 the proceeding be dismissed.
