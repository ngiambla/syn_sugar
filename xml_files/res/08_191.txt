 It points to its evidence that, as a result of ONGC's delay and breach in effecting well-completion, the Works were not capable of being completed by 13 April 2007 and the parties thereafter engaged in attempts to negotiate a new completion date but that nothing final was agreed.
 I found that it was entirely reasonable at the time of the call on the performance guarantees for ONGC to infer from the non-provision of copies of those policies or the Certificates of Insurance to it that Clough had failed to honour its obligation to secure their extension.
