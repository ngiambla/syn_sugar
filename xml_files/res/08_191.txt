 This injunction was extended on 12 June 2007 and on 19 June 2007, following an inter parties hearing, when an application by the Banks to discharge the injunction was dismissed. (b) On 7 June 2007 an ex parte interim injunction was granted against ONGC restraining it from taking further steps to demand or obtain payment, or renewing such claims or demands, from the Banks under the performance guarantees.
 It points to its evidence that, as a result of ONGC's delay and breach in effecting well-completion, the Works were not capable of being completed by 13 April 2007 and the parties thereafter engaged in attempts to negotiate a new completion date but that nothing final was agreed.
 I found that it was entirely reasonable at the time of the call on the performance guarantees for ONGC to infer from the non-provision of copies of those policies or the Certificates of Insurance to it that Clough had failed to honour its obligation to secure their extension.
 The Court failed, it said, to consider first the fact that the policies had been renewed and secondly that ONGC's remedy, within the context of the contract as a whole, pursuant to cl 7.3.9, in the event that Clough failed to take out and/or keep in force insurance policies, was to obtain its own insurance and to retain the amount of the premium from monies owing to Clough.
