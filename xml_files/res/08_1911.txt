 That decision was affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by the Hon R J Groom (Deputy President) and Dr J Campbell (Member): Farnaby and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2008] AATA 603.
 The Tribunal must take relevant considerations into account. 66 Returning to the present case, the alleged questions in Mr Farnaby's amended notice of appeal do not show that the appeal is on questions of law.
