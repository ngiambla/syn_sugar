 That decision was affirmed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by the Hon R J Groom (Deputy President) and Dr J Campbell (Member): Farnaby and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission [2008] AATA 603.
 Mr Pratt gave evidence for Mr Farnaby at the hearing. 18 The Tribunal accepted Mr Farnaby's evidence (corroborated as it was by other former recruits) as to his mistreatment at HMAS Leeuwin.
 The causation issue 55 While acknowledging that, at [172] of its reasons, the Tribunal correctly identified the causation issue, Mr Read submitted that it erred because in the next paragraph it determined that Mr Farnaby's symptoms, which commenced in the early 1980s, "arose as a consequence of the deaths of his parents, and a re-opening of issues resulting from the parents' departure to England in 1970".
 The Tribunal must take relevant considerations into account. 66 Returning to the present case, the alleged questions in Mr Farnaby's amended notice of appeal do not show that the appeal is on questions of law.
