 1 The Travel Compensation Fund ('the TCF') by application filed on 31 July 2008 applies pursuant to s 59 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules (Cth) ('the Rules') for an order that the respondents make discovery to the TCF of the documents identified in Schedule 1 to the application.
 In considering that question Middleton J was required to determine whether a duty of care may have existed and whether there was any evidence before the Court that such duty had been breached. 27 In the present proceeding the TCF identified its possible causes of action against the respondents as arising under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
 It is not for the respondents to make such a determination based on the material in their possession. 46 The respondents also submit that the third category of documents referred to in the schedule to the application calls for the production of the general ledger of Orient for the 2005 and 2006 financial years.
