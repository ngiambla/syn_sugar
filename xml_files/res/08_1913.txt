 They promoted three dance parties (held on 24 and 31 May 2008 at the Alluva night club and on 8 June 2008 at the Billboard night club) by reference to the marks.
 At that time the first respondent, Mr Kalliakoudis, was represented by a legal adviser but the second respondent, Mr Missailidis, appeared in person. 3 By agreement of the parties the action was referred to a mediation which took place on 25 June 2008.
 Mr Missailidis asserts that if Mr Kardas (or his solicitors) had contacted him before commencing the action and told him to stop using the marks he would have done so immediately.
