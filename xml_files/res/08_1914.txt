 The taxing master's order was in the following terms: "The costs of the [applicants] are taxed and allowed in the sum of $123,587.41 to be paid by the [respondent]. " The respondent challenges the validity of the bankruptcy notice.
 He says that an order of the taxing master is not a final order or final judgment for the purpose of the Bankruptcy Act . 4 In most jurisdictions, upon the completion of a taxation of a bill of costs, the taxing master issues a certificate of taxation or an allocatur.
 Once the taxing master has made a final order with the respect to those costs, the order "may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment for the payment of money" (O 63 r 11(1)).
 Nonetheless, the order of the taxing master must be authenticated before the amount for costs can be levied by warrant of execution. 13 Neither the foregoing nor my view that Scott is wrongly decided provides the answer to this case.
