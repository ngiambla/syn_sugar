 On 22 September 2006, the first respondent, FKP Limited ("FKP" and collectively with Lifestyle "the respondents") became the owner of 100% of the issued shares in Lifestyle. 2 From about 2005, the applicant, Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd ("Coles") was negotiating with Lifestyle for an Agreement for Lease ("AFL") and Lease whereby Coles would lease from Lifestyle supermarket premises in a proposed retail development to be constructed on the Tarneit Property.
 For now, the important point is that events underwent a fundamental shift on 18 March 2008 when, without the knowledge of Coles, Lifestyle and Woolworths signed a letter of offer of supermarket premises in a revised proposed retail development to be constructed on the Tarneit Property ("the Woolworths' Letter of Offer").
 FKP's enticement to Woolworths to purchase the land at Cowes and become the anchor tenant at Shepparton was to offer Woolworths a package that included not only a lease of Shepparton and the purchase of Cowes but the ability to lease Tarneit.
