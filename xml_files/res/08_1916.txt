 I shall use the names and descriptions contained in the earlier judgment. 2 Peter Jackson submits that it has succeeded in establishing a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and that there are no special circumstances which would affect the application of the general rule that a successful party should get its costs.
 This was said to arise from the closure of the Peter Jackson William Street store as a result of MSWD's misrepresentations. 8 The damages claim was substantially modified at trial, but even so Peter Jackson failed to establish that the closure of the William Street store had any connection with any wrongful conduct of MSWD.
 In reality, Peter Jackson obtained no tangible benefit from this litigation. 9 I think an order of costs that would fairly represent the respective success of the parties is that MSWD should receive all of its costs up to and including the first day of trial and thereafter 90 per cent of its costs. 10 In the circumstances therefore no question of one-third off reduction arises.
