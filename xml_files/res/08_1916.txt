 I shall use the names and descriptions contained in the earlier judgment. 2 Peter Jackson submits that it has succeeded in establishing a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and that there are no special circumstances which would affect the application of the general rule that a successful party should get its costs.
 It also submits that its costs should not be reduced by one-third under O 62 r 36A of the Federal Court Rules . 3 In my view, however, this case cannot be regarded as one in which Peter Jackson was successful, or even substantially successful. 6 It was not until the first day of the trial on 18 November 2008 that Peter Jackson was granted leave to further amend its statement of claim to allege the Limited Time representation.
 This was said to arise from the closure of the Peter Jackson William Street store as a result of MSWD's misrepresentations. 8 The damages claim was substantially modified at trial, but even so Peter Jackson failed to establish that the closure of the William Street store had any connection with any wrongful conduct of MSWD.
