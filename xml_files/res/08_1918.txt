 Under the valuation method the margin for the supply is the amount by which the consideration for the supply exceeds the 'valuation' as at 1 July 2000. 5 The valuation for the purposes of determining the margin under the valuation method is a valuation made in compliance with the requirements determined in writing by the Commissioner.
 There could be no middle course here--if not provided by a professional valuation there would be no 'valuation'. 29 Equally the valuer 'must' have regard to three matters: the market value of the completed premises; the cost to complete the partly completed premises; and the profit margin and holding costs that are attributable to the period on or after the valuation date.
 A hypothetical developer buying the property for approximately $23,000,000 on 1 July 2000 would pay Victorian duty on the purchase at a rate of 5.5%, which is $1,265,000. 73 Again, I consider that Mr Nicodimou misdirected himself, and the valuation does not comply in this respect with the Determination, and therefore does not comply with s 75-10(3) of the GST Act.
