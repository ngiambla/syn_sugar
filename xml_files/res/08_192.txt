 So there seems to be some historical content to the assertion of these rights, or identification of them at least, and in the affidavit of 23 July 1999 , Mr Mills says that the native title rights of the Naghir People are these: (a) The Naghir People have always enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, their rights to use, and occupy their land and to exclude others from it and to use and enjoy the natural resources of the land such as animal and plant life.
 For example, I regularly use bamboo from the land for the manufacture of spears. 17 Mr Mills says that Naghir People leave their land to the children and others in accordance with their tradition and custom and grant and withhold permission for others to use their land and, for example, Mr Mills' children will inherit his land. 18 Mr Mills further says: (c) Naghir People hunt over the land, forage the land, garden the land and generally use the resource of the land albeit in somewhat changing ways over the years.
