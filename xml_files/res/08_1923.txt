 Secondly, both the parenting payment decision and the family tax benefit decisions should be set aside, for failure of the Tribunal to comply with the requirements of ss 43(2) and (2B) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act) to provide adequate reasons for its decisions. 4 For the reasons which follow, the appellant succeeds on both of these grounds.
 The issue of notional entitlement, however, has in this case been argued and considered only with regard to s 1237AAD of the Social Security Act . 31 In order to enliven the discretion to waive a debt found in section 1237AAD of the Social Security Act , the appellant was required to show that "special circumstances" existed.
 The Tribunal went on to consider the other circumstances of this case under the framework of special circumstances waiver. 41 The Tribunal in the third sentence seems to be saying that the notional entitlement of the appellant is not a "special" circumstance, because it is not "sufficiently unusual, uncommon or exceptional".
 There appears to be no case in the Federal Magistrates Court, or in the Federal Court, in which "notional entitlement" has been definitively considered. 43 Decisions of the AAT which concluded that notional entitlement was not a relevant matter in considering whether special circumstances exist to justify waiver are Re Schulze and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services [2004] AATA 705 ; (2004) 81 ALD 636 ( Schulze ) and Re Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services and Varhegyi [2005] AATA 635 ; (2005) 87 ALD 717 ( Varhegyi ). 44 In Schulze , the applicant had been overpaid a parenting allowance, following which the Department raised and sought to recover the debt.
