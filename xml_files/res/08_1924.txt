 She said that she had not had problems with the authorities before that: she had just been a common citizen. 13 The Tribunal continued, at [29]: Moreover, although I accept that the applicant was laid off by her employer because she had breached the 'one child' policy, she was employed from 2005 until she left China in 2007.
 The Tribunal accepted that she had been mistreated because of her breach of the [one-child] policy; the Tribunal was wrong to find that this mistreatment had not been for a reason connected to the Convention. 15 The appellant also put before Scarlett FM compassionate grounds for allowing her to stay, including certain medical reasons.
 The Tribunal had in fact found that the applicant's claims had no Convention nexus, and therefore, the applicant could not be classified as a person to whom Australia owed obligations under the Convention. 18 Scarlett FM concluded, at [43] of his Honour's reasons: The Court's jurisdiction is confined to a consideration as to whether the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error.
