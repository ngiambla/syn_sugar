 Mr Jensen opposed the making of these orders whereas Mr Thompson was content to submit to any order of the Court. 2 The Jensen proceedings involve a claim by Mr Jensen against HFA Holdings Limited and HFA Admin Pty Ltd for breach of an employment contract.
 In a cross-claim in the Jensen proceedings the respondents also claim from Mr Jensen an indemnity against any liability to Mr Thompson arising from the termination of Mr Thompson's employment. 3 The Thomson proceedings involve a claim by Mr Thompson against HFA Asset Management Limited and HFA Admin Pty Ltd for breach of an employment contract by way of unlawful termination and associated claims for breach of the Trade Practices Act .
 No defences or cross-claims have been filed in the Thompson proceedings as a result of the notice of motion for consolidation being raised at the first directions hearing for that matter. 4 Order 29 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules provides as follows: Where several proceedings are pending in the Court, then, if it appears to the Court: (a) that some common question of law or fact arises in both or all of them; (b) that the rights to relief claimed therein are in respect of, or arise out of, the same transaction or series of transactions; or (c) that for some other reason it is desirable to make an order under this rule; the Court may order those proceedings to be consolidated or may order them to be tried at the same time or one immediately after another or may order them to be stayed until after the determination of any of them. 5 The respondents submitted that it would be in the interests of justice that the proceedings be consolidated or heard together as: - (i) both proceedings raised common questions of law and fact concerning Mr Jensen's employment of Mr Thompson, (ii) the same issues arising in the defence and cross-claim in the Jensen proceedings would form part of a likely cross-claim against Mr Jensen in the Thompson proceedings, (iii) without orders being made the Court will have to determine the facts relating to Mr Jensen's employment of Mr Thompson twice, raising the prospect of increased cost and delay and inconsistent findings, (iv) there is no evidence of actual or potential prejudice to Mr Jensen, there being no reason why the Thompson proceedings could not also be ready for hearing on the dates allocated for the hearing of the Jensen matter (27 April to 1 May 2009).
 The respondent also said that the lack of a defence and cross-claim in the Thompson proceedings could not be put against the respondents as the docket judge for those proceedings had declined to make orders requiring the filing and service of the defence and cross-claim pending the resolution of the issue of consolidation or a joint hearing.
 Consideration would have to be given to amending the defence and cross-claim in the Jensen proceedings to deal with the matters raised in the Thompson proceedings. 6 Mr Jensen submitted that: - (i) as the pleadings currently stand there are no common issues of fact and law, (ii) the Court should not engage in speculation about the content of future pleadings, particularly given the lack of any draft defence or cross-claim in the Thompson proceedings or certainty about a cross-claim or its content, and (iii) Mr Jensen would be prejudiced by the making of the orders in a number of respects.
 If the orders are made Mr Jensen would be at risk of cross-examination on the claims made by Mr Thompson which have no relevance in his own proceedings whilst giving a collateral forensic advantage to the respondents (by avoiding the issue of whether to call Mr Jensen in the Thompson proceedings and Mr Thompson in the Jensen proceedings).
 The number of unrelated issues means that any order for consolidation or a joint hearing will have limited capacity to save time and expense for the Court and the respondents but will increase the time and expense for Mr Jensen including by reason of a need for regular rulings on the admissibility of evidence in one or the other or both proceedings.
 The Court could not be "affirmatively satisfied" that the orders would not result in unfairness to Mr Jensen ( Bishop v Bridgelands Securities (1990) 25 FCR 311 at 314). 7 There is considerable force in the submission on behalf of Mr Jensen that neither he nor the Court should have to speculate about the nature and degree of the overlap between the issues in the Jensen and the Thompson proceedings in the final form they take.
 Similarly I accept that there are issues in both sets of proceedings which are not common (including the terms of their respective contracts of employment, what might or might not amount to serious misconduct having regard to those contracts and claims about Mr Jensen's conduct unrelated to the employment of Mr Thompson).
 This does not require consolidation of the proceedings but indicates that there are reasons why it might be in the interests of justice that the proceedings be heard together. 8 I do not consider that the risk to the hearing date in the Jensen proceedings outweighs the potential for an overall saving in time and cost for the resolution of both proceedings (albeit accepting that hearing the matters together will be likely to result in a lengthier hearing than each individual matter, particularly for the Thompson proceedings).
 However, I am concerned about not being able fully to assess any potential unfairness to Mr Jensen by reason of not having the defence and any cross-claim in the Thompson proceedings and the foreshadowed possible amendment to the defence and cross-claim in the Jensen proceedings.
 To facilitate this occurring it seems to me that: - (i) directions should be made in the Thompson proceedings for the balance of the pleadings and evidence, (ii) any outstanding issues for directions in the Jensen proceedings should be resolved (including varying the timetable where there has been breach), (iii) the hearing dates in the Jensen proceedings should be maintained if possible at this stage but recognising that the dates may need to be varied to accommodate a hearing with the Thompson proceedings, and (iv) a common mention date for both proceedings should be fixed after the completion of the required steps with the notice of motion to be adjourned for any further hearing on that day.
