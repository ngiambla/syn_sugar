 These aspects are an alleged failure to disclose to the Board a salary increase for Mr Thompson from a particular date and the making of a payment to Mr Thompson's company for work not done or already paid for and that resulted in Mr Thompson's salary exceeding the budgeted staff costs disclosed to the Board.
 The respondent also said that the lack of a defence and cross-claim in the Thompson proceedings could not be put against the respondents as the docket judge for those proceedings had declined to make orders requiring the filing and service of the defence and cross-claim pending the resolution of the issue of consolidation or a joint hearing.
 The number of unrelated issues means that any order for consolidation or a joint hearing will have limited capacity to save time and expense for the Court and the respondents but will increase the time and expense for Mr Jensen including by reason of a need for regular rulings on the admissibility of evidence in one or the other or both proceedings.
