 The qualification is that Intel could only claim the redemption premium amount to be payable if the change of control caused Unwired not to be ready, willing and able to implement the WiMAX roll out. 27 The structure of the deed poll followed a fairly conventional form for such securities.
 EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL DEFENCE 55 Unwired pleaded that an equitable estoppel arose against Intel from the representations and conduct it had pleaded, in effect, in pars 33-35A inclusive, which I have just discussed, so that in entering in to the deed poll, or the transactions overall, Unwired assumed or expected that the redemption premium amount would only become payable on a change of control of Unwired, if the change of control caused Unwired not to be ready, willing and able to implement the WiMAX roll out.
 The desire of Unwired to raise an argument that the obligation to pay the redemption premium amount is, or operates as, a penalty so as to preserve its position to litigate that issue in the High Court without the need for a new trial, may possibly be a matter that can be accommodated in a proper procedural context.
