 The acknowledgment or observation of a law or custom does not necessarily amount to a right or interest "in" the land itself but may give rise to a native title right or interest "in relation to" the land.
 The existence of native title over other land held by the Land Council may or may not be relevant but it is not determinative of native title over or in relation to Lot 576.
