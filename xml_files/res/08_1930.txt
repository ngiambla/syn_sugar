 The correspondence shows that Dr Markovic not only repeatedly requested Ms Huang to concentrate on her literature review throughout 2001 but also warned her that if she could not provide it he could not recommend her re-enrolment.
 Dr Markovic and Professor Winder encouraged her to persist and complete the necessary review and warned her of the consequences if she failed to do so. 15 Ms Huang submitted the first draft literature review on 28 September 2001.
 Whether or not each of those steps was appropriate or did in fact assist Ms Huang, it does demonstrate that there was a continuing problem, so far as Dr Markovic and Professor Winder were concerned, with Ms Huang's progress.
