 He considers that indicative bids will be submitted by 30 January 2009 and he anticipates that the sale process will conclude in March 2009, but this is subject to any delays in relation to final negotiations and documentation and possibly in obtaining regulatory approval such as approval which may be required by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. 11 Each of the companies held a first meeting of creditors during December 2008.
 I should point out that this creditor has indicated in correspondence that he may be prepared to consent to an extension of up to 45 days. 16 The other creditor who opposes the extension of 90 days specifically says that he cannot support an extension beyond 30 days.
 Indeed, it would be costly in the administration and would divert resources from the completion and attention to the details of the sale process which is now being undertaken. 30 I have already referred to the fact that extension is not for a fixed period, but is for a period of up to 90 days, and that Mr McMaster says if he is able to do so, he will convene the meeting of creditors at the earliest possible time.
