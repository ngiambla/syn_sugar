 1 This is an application made pursuant to s 61 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) for a determination that no native title exists in relation to a number of parcels of land, situated in Bega, to which I will refer in more detail below.
 There was neighbouring land which was in private ownership and that land had limited rights of access, in terms which would have been sufficient to create easements for the benefit of that land, but for the fact that such easements could not be granted over state forests.
 It also covers part of Lots 99 and 100 in Deposited Plan 1040981, which is an area five metres wide following the line of an existing water pipe, marked in yellow on sheets 1 and 2 of the plan, which is marked A2 in the non-claimant application. 6 The second step in the application involves a land swap whereby a small area of land comprising a part of a driveway and a carport are to be transferred to the applicant.
