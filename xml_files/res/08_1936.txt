 The trustee of the PIA was the applicant. 2 At a meeting of the respondent's creditors held on 30 September 2008 a resolution was passed purporting to terminate the PIA under s 222B(1) of the Act.
 Together with the applicant, Mr Cauchi has had the day-to-day conduct of the administration of the respondent's property and the PIA. 10 The meeting on 30 September was attended by the respondent and also by Mr Robin Castello as a proxy for the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Tim Brace of CJL Partners and Mr Cauchi.
 The respondent said he was unable to make that payment until the end of the week but had funds of $36,000 available at the meeting. 16 There was some discussion about the source of the forthcoming money.
 The creditors at the meeting are not going to be in a position to resolve such disputes themselves, but at least, as a practical matter, they should have the benefit of a statement as to the trustee's satisfaction as to default.
