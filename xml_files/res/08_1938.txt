 The trial judge said that the tribunal was entitled to form its own views as to the accuracy and weight of country information, relying on NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at 440 [81] per Young J with whom Gyles and Stone JJ agreed.
 However, the tribunal's reasons did not deal with the fundamental question which the tribunal was required to consider, namely whether S would be subjected to serious and systematic mistreatment amounting to persecution within the meaning of s 91R(1) of the Act because he would remain a "black child" whilever the fee was unpaid.
 The tribunal did not expressly give separate attention to this claim but made a general finding that it was satisfied that the husband had manufactured his claims in order to make a claim for a protection visa and found that he was not a credible witness.
 The trial judge held that, whether or not the tribunal addressed this matter as a separate claim, the tribunal dealt sufficiently with the possibility that the father might have further children in breach of the one child policy when it considered his other claims.
