 Any other property does not vest. 38 Section 60(4) is part of the scheme of the Act which excises from the bankrupt's property at the time of the sequestration order property that would otherwise be divisible among the bankrupt's creditors being any action for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt, the bankrupt's spouse or member of the family, or any action for the death of the bankrupt's spouse or member of the family by allowing the bankrupt to continue the action notwithstanding the sequestration order.
 Whilst the trustee may require the bankrupt to make contributions out of the bankrupt's income, the Bankruptcy Act contemplates that those contributions will be made out of income in the hands of the bankrupt not the trustee. 73 The position therefore is no different from the position when s 131 was part of the Bankruptcy Act or s 101 part of the 1924 Bankruptcy Act .
 For example, there are a number of references in the Bankruptcy Act to "property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors" (see, for example, s 58(6) and the definition of "the property of the bankrupt" in s 5) ; it could not seriously be suggested that the bankrupt's employment, or the bankrupt's rights as to his or her employment could be divisible among the creditors.
