 It is not clear whether the grounds refer to the second Tribunal decision, which has twice been the subject of review by the Federal Magistrates Court, this Court and the High Court, or the jurisdiction decision.
 In these circumstances, the third Tribunal's duty was to assess whether it had jurisdiction before embarking upon a second or third review of the delegate's decision. 11 I turn to consider the grounds of appeal in the draft notice of appeal.
 The applicant was deprived of the natural justice and procedural fairness. 12 As to the second ground, the only documents relevant to the Tribunal on the question of jurisdiction are the decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court, this Court and the High Court.
