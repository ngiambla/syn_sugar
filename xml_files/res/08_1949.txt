[Schedule 1, item 2, subsection 703-50(3)] 3.93 Once given to the Commissioner, the choice is irrevocable and remains effective until the consolidated group ceases to exist. [Schedule 1, item 2, subsections 703-50(2) and (4)] 3.94 Further, the day specified in the notice of choice, from which the group will be consolidated, cannot be amended. [Schedule 1, item 2, subsection 703-50(2)] 3.95 A choice has no effect if the Commissioner is satisfied that the notice of choice contains information that is incorrect in a material particular.
