 This was said to be because s 61C permits a manufacturer to "deliver for home consumption from a place specified in the permission" (emphasis added). 139 The Commissioner's submissions can be summarised as follows: (a) Upon their manufacture, Caltex did not sell or export the residual oils.
 Accordingly, Caltex was required as a condition of its permission to include the residual oils in its weekly return and pay the corresponding duty. 140 I agree with the Commissioner that Caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption for the purposes of the Excise Act .
 As Caltex put it, since s 60 applies only to goods "which are subject to [the Commissioner's] control" --- which control ceases upon delivery for home consumption --- then the Commissioner's request was an acknowledgment that the residual oils were still subject to its control and had not therefore been delivered. 147 This however is to misconstrue the section and its intended operation.
 The premise of the Commissioner's conclusion in the Advice that the residual oils had been delivered for home consumption and had not been accounted for (the latter of which, curiously, was not based on any request to account at that stage), was that the residual oils had been burnt by Caltex as a fuel oil.
