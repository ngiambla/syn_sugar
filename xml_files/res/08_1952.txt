 Here the evidence, albeit skimpy as the applicant conceded, is that Stage 5 and The Promotions Factory Pty Ltd (Promotions) entered into a joint venture, using the applicant as the joint venture vehicle, to act as the official concessionaire in respect of souvenirs, memorabilia and apparel for the 2006 Commonwealth Games.
 Given the available inference, thus strengthened, and the onus the applicant bore to establish the facts supporting the existence of the privilege at the time of the disclosure of the documents to Mr Glover, I am not satisfied that in October 2005 there was any prospect of Stage 5 deriving a return in respect of its shareholding.
 As to the former it is not necessary that I rule on whether, because Mr Strapp was no longer a director of the applicant when he received the document and gave it to Mr Glover, a common interest would otherwise have existed. 24 On par 3 of the notice of motion I will declare that documents 5.1, 5.5 and 5.6 are the subject of common interest privilege between Stage 5 and the applicant, and that the other documents are not. 25 Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the notice of motion can be dealt with together.
