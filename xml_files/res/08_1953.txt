 On 13 August 2008, I dismissed the application on the basis that the Federal Court did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the application ( Fernando v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (No 2) [2008] FCA 1216).
 I said that I would hear the parties on costs. 5 The respondent contended that the usual rule in relation to costs should apply and that the Court should order that the applicant pay the costs of the respondent.
 I also recognise that one of the reasons why a next friend is appointed to conduct litigation on behalf of a person lacking capacity to conduct the litigation on his or her own behalf, is that there should be a person who is ultimately liable for the costs of the successful party. 8 Secondly, I take into account the circumstances of the appointment of Mr Ley to act as tutor for Mr Fernando.
