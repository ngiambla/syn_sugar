 I therefore consider there is a real legal controversy in this case, that the ACCC has a real interest in seeking the relief it does and that sufficient consequences will flow from making the declaration. 25 Secondly, I consider the consent declaration incorporates the critical facts which constitute these breaches. 26 Thirdly, I consider the consent compliance orders under s 86C of the Act are in the public interest because they will, among other things, assist to ensure compliance with the Code.
 This, all the more so, where that requirement was one of the means by which the Code was intended to produce its stated purposes of achieving greater clarity and transparency of transactions between growers and agents. 27 Finally, I consider order 2.3, which requires Grove Edgar to provide to the ACCC a list of the growers that have been written to in accordance with order 2.1, is appropriate in the circumstances mentioned above.
