 To achieve these ends the Explanatory Statement states that the Code is intended to address, among other things, a lack of clarity about when a wholesaler is trading as an agent or as a merchant when dealing with growers; and a failure to invest in written documentation of trade, including written transaction information and written trading agreements. 7 Under cl 6 of the Code a trader (which is defined in clause 3 to mean an agent or a merchant) and a grower (which is defined in clause 3 to mean a person who grows his or her horticulture produce for sale) may only trade in horticulture produce (which is defined in clause 3 to include unprocessed fruits), if they have entered into a Horticulture Produce Agreement as described in the Code.
 I therefore consider there is a real legal controversy in this case, that the ACCC has a real interest in seeking the relief it does and that sufficient consequences will flow from making the declaration. 25 Secondly, I consider the consent declaration incorporates the critical facts which constitute these breaches. 26 Thirdly, I consider the consent compliance orders under s 86C of the Act are in the public interest because they will, among other things, assist to ensure compliance with the Code.
 This, all the more so, where that requirement was one of the means by which the Code was intended to produce its stated purposes of achieving greater clarity and transparency of transactions between growers and agents. 27 Finally, I consider order 2.3, which requires Grove Edgar to provide to the ACCC a list of the growers that have been written to in accordance with order 2.1, is appropriate in the circumstances mentioned above.
 Conversely, I do not consider that an order that is being made by consent; that does not involve a system of monitoring Grove Edgar's compliance with the Court's orders over a lengthy period of time; and that, instead, involves the once off provision of information to the ACCC, is akin to an order for the appointment of an external auditor of the kind that was disapproved by the Full Court in BMW re s 86C, or doubted by Mansfield J in Rural Press re s 80. 28 For these reasons I propose to make the consent orders proposed by the parties.
