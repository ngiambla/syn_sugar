 It came before me for hearing today. 4 On the application being called on for hearing, the material initially relied upon on the part of the administrators comprised an affidavit of Mr Bettles sworn on 10 December 2008, and a further affidavit of Mr Bettles sworn on 15 December 2008, the latter being filed by leave.
 To understand the relevance of that particular affidavit and its contents, some brief recitation of the background to the winding up application and the state of affairs of the company, as best the administrator has presently been able to ascertain them, is necessary. 6 There are no secured creditors of the company.
 The question of whether an administration should continue, rather than that there be a winding up, is obviously closely related to the further question of whether the creditors could hope to get more by way of payment of their debts from one form of process or administration than from the other.
