 1 These proceedings involve an appeal against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court that the appellants pay damages of $26,000 for breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and costs, as well as associated orders for delivery up of items associated with the sale of a t-shirt known as the yellow 33 South t-shirt.
 As to whether security for costs should be ordered, Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38, a case of more than 100 years ago, sets out the fundamental principle: "The general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant, that, from time immemorial, has been the rule at common law.
 For these reasons I consider an order for the provision of security in the sum of $25,000 appropriate failing which the appeal should be stayed rather than dismissed. 9 For these reasons the appellants' notice of motion should be dismissed and an order requiring the provision of security made.
