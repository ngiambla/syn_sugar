 1 These proceedings involve an appeal against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court that the appellants pay damages of $26,000 for breach of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and costs, as well as associated orders for delivery up of items associated with the sale of a t-shirt known as the yellow 33 South t-shirt.
 The appeal is to be heard by a single judge as provided for in s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act . 2 The principal claims in the amended notice of appeal filed 26 September 2008 are that the primary judge erred in finding that: - (i) the use of Terry Fitzgerald's name and image on the yellow 33 South t-shirt conveyed a representation that there was an association between Terry Fitzgerald and the production and offering of the t-shirt, and (ii) a reasonable consumer in the relevant class would assume that Mr Fitzgerald had sanctioned, permitted or allowed the production and sale of the impugned t-shirt. 3 The primary judge found (amongst other things) that: - (i) the relevant class of consumer was purchasers of surfboards and surf related products, (ii) amongst this group Mr Fitzgerald is well known as is his association with Hot Buttered International Pty Limited, (iii) with reference to all of the evidence, the use of Mr Fitzgerald's name and image on the yellow 33 South t-shirt was conduct misrepresenting to a reasonable member of the relevant class that Mr Fitzgerald had some association with the production and sale of the t-shirt. 4 The appellants submitted that the grant of a stay does not require special or exceptional circumstances and a court will ordinarily grant a stay where the appeal would otherwise be rendered nugatory ( Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd (1985) 2 NSWLR 685 at 693 and 695).
 As to whether security for costs should be ordered, Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch D 34 at 38, a case of more than 100 years ago, sets out the fundamental principle: "The general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant, that, from time immemorial, has been the rule at common law.
 For these reasons I consider an order for the provision of security in the sum of $25,000 appropriate failing which the appeal should be stayed rather than dismissed. 9 For these reasons the appellants' notice of motion should be dismissed and an order requiring the provision of security made.
