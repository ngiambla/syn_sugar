 By its amended application, Travelex claimed, in addition, a declaration that the Fijian Currency Transaction was a supply of or in relation to rights, and a GST-free supply by reason of Item 4(a) of s 38-190(1).
 There is no sufficient connection or association between the supply constituted by the Fijian Currency Transaction within the meaning of the GST Act and the incidents of being the owner or holder of bank notes.
 Item 4 does not apply where the supply of rights is merely integral, ancillary or incidental to another dominant part of the supply, the supply being characterised by the dominant part.
