 I think, however, that is how the defendant put its case, albeit under the guise of a s 31A summary judgment application. 44 If a party seeks relief which on any understanding must be plainly and obviously not available to that party, the Court would strike out the relief.
 In any event, it could not be said that this prayer for relief had a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay. 54 The relief sought in paragraph 10 is, as I say, consequential apparently upon an order made in paragraph 8.
 It may be the Court would decide that it is in the plaintiffs', the defendant's and the other members' of the defendant's interests that the plaintiffs' shareholding should be acquired by the defendant so that the plaintiffs could exit the defendant.
