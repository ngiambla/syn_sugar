 For present purposes, only the contract between the plaintiffs and the fourth defendant is relevant. 6 It is alleged by the plaintiffs that on or about 4 June 2007 they entered into a forward contract with the fourth defendant for the delivery of 1,070 tonnes of barley to Port Lincoln in November/December 2007 at a price of $203 per tonne.
 The plaintiffs' claim against the fourth defendant based on the Corporations Act is bound to fail and judgment ought to be given in favour of the fourth defendant against the plaintiffs under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
