 I concluded that the brief affidavit filed by Mr Morrison did not comply with the Order and that Mr Morrison's conduct was not merely casual, accidental or unintentional but constituted wilful disobedience of the Court's order. 3 The applicant seeks an order that Mr Morrison be fined $50,000.00 for his contempt.

 It is well established that a motion for contempt is separate and distinct from the principal proceeding: see Real Tech Systems Integration Pty Ltd v Meuross (1998) 82 FCR 150 at 151 referring to O'Shea v O'Shea (1890) 15 PD 59.
