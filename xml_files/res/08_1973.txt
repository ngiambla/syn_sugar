 The proceeding with which I am concerned was commenced solely for the purpose of obtaining an order removing the Western Australian proceeding to Adelaide in advance of the first directions hearing of the Western Australian proceeding in Perth.
 That application was heard today on affidavit. 10 It is not clear to me whether the proceeding that was commenced in Western Australia was only a proceeding of the kind which has been commenced and which I am presently considering, that is a proceeding for an order that another proceeding in another Registry be transferred to this Registry.
