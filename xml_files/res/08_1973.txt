 The proceeding with which I am concerned was commenced solely for the purpose of obtaining an order removing the Western Australian proceeding to Adelaide in advance of the first directions hearing of the Western Australian proceeding in Perth.
 That application was heard today on affidavit. 10 It is not clear to me whether the proceeding that was commenced in Western Australia was only a proceeding of the kind which has been commenced and which I am presently considering, that is a proceeding for an order that another proceeding in another Registry be transferred to this Registry.
 However, in my opinion, s 48 does not empower a party to apply in a separate proceeding for an order for the transfer of another proceeding in another place to the place in which the proceeding seeking to invoke s 48 has been made. 15 If it were otherwise, it would mean that the parties would be put to the cost of filing applications and affidavits in two separate proceedings to deal with the same subject matter relating to where the matter ought to be heard.
