 1 The plaintiff makes application under s 509(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for an order that ASIC deregister the company known as Ranelagh House Pty Ltd on 15 December 2010. 2 The plaintiff claims to be a creditor of Ranelagh House, which went into liquidation.
 The plaintiff notified the liquidator of its claim to be a creditor in August 2008. 3 The plaintiff contends that on 22 September 2008, without any communication from the liquidator in relation to the claim made by the plaintiff, the liquidator made a final distribution from the funds available to the liquidator which consisted of a significant surplus that was distributed to the members of the company.
 The application having been made within the period referred to in s 509(6) , I am satisfied that I have power to make the order. 6 The application is not made by the liquidator, but it is made by the plaintiff as an interested party.
