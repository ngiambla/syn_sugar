 1 This is an application for an order pursuant to s 461(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that the defendant company, Ambernap Pty Ltd, be wound up and that Mr Scott Darren Pascoe be appointed as the official liquidator of that company. 2 Critical to the application is the fact that Ambernap is a sole member, sole director company.
 Ambernap owns approximately 34 per cent of the issued share capital in Pendarves. 4 On 3 December 2004, Mr Holzman wrote to the solicitors for Mr Pascoe stating that Mr Holzman expected to pay a dividend of approximately $95,000 as soon as Mr Holzman received confirmation of Mr Pascoe's appointment as official liquidator of Ambernap.
 However, it seems to me that in the present case, where Ambernap is a sole member, sole director company, there is no real difference between the interests of the bankrupt and the interests of the member of the company. 7 Of course, the interests of creditors need to be considered, and I have been taken to evidence of the somewhat scanty records of Ambernap, which include a balance sheet as at 30 June 2005.
 This is because, as I have said, the sole asset would appear to be the dividend of approximately $97,000 that will come into the administration, and there is a plain need to avoid incurring duplicated costs and expenses arising from the appointment of a different person as the liquidator of Ambernap. 9 It seems to me, therefore, that I should make an order for the winding up of Ambernap and the appointment of Mr Pascoe as the official liquidator.
