 1 This is an application for an order pursuant to s 461(1)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that the defendant company, Ambernap Pty Ltd, be wound up and that Mr Scott Darren Pascoe be appointed as the official liquidator of that company. 2 Critical to the application is the fact that Ambernap is a sole member, sole director company.
 However, it seems to me that in the present case, where Ambernap is a sole member, sole director company, there is no real difference between the interests of the bankrupt and the interests of the member of the company. 7 Of course, the interests of creditors need to be considered, and I have been taken to evidence of the somewhat scanty records of Ambernap, which include a balance sheet as at 30 June 2005.
