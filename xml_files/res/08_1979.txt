 Hamilton, having tendered the Lo Lo emails and attachments, cannot now in my view properly resist putting into evidence its own lawyers' request. 9 In the circumstances I am satisfied that client legal privilege has been lost in relation to that request because the disclosure of the request itself is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the invoices. 2.
 That occurred yesterday and it was when the issue of leave was raised with me, albeit it had been flagged I understand to the respondent some time previously. 12 The terms of the proposed amendment insofar as presently relevant and for that matter the declared purpose sought to be secured by it are as follows: 8.6 Ovcharenko represented to Dr Keung in trade and commerce that the reason for inserting the proposed clause 52.1 (now clause 50.1 of the Distribution Agreement) into the Distribution Agreement, was to incorporate a bonus offer in Schedule 5 (" the clause 50 representation ").
 Given the course of this proceedings and its considerable lengthening, that the applicant had closed its case and the respondents had called their last witness and that the timetable for submissions etc has been fixed and cannot be varied without a considerably longer delay to the finalisation of this matter, I am unprepared to take a course that would permit further cross-examination and, hence, further delay. 18 It may well be the case that the cross-examination that has been conducted of the two witnesses so far as it goes is suggestive of a possible contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
