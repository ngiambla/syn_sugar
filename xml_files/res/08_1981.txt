 Mr de Kerloy, appearing for the respondent, has simply put before the Court matters, which in his submission, the Court ought be informed in the process of making its reasoned judgment as to whether or not the motion ought be granted. 2 The motion is supported by affidavits of Dr Rajumati Bhula affirmed on 2 and 15 December 2008.
 The absence of any material risk is, apart from any other considerations, including the concession made by counsel to which I have referred, also manifest by the failure by the appellant to take any action available to it under the legislation to protect humans, animals or the environment, such as the very interventionist powers available under s 102(1)(a)(ii) and (iii) of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cth) to recall products for that very reason. 8 I do not consider that relevant special circumstances exist for the expedition of this appeal.
