 The Tribunal found that, while the Veteran may have died when he did, rather than some hours or days later, because he had ischemic heart disease, the ischemic heart disease was not the cause or even one of the causes of the Veteran's death.
 The Tribunal concluded that, in the light of its finding that the kind of death met by the Veteran was death by pulmonary embolism, the application must fail. 15 In Mrs Collins's supplementary notice of appeal of 4 July 2008, two grounds of appeal were stated as follows: 1.
 The Tribunal incorrectly held that a medical condition found to be contributory to the death of the Veteran, namely ischemic heart disease, was not a kind of death of the Veteran for the purposes of s 120A of the Act. 2.
 The Tribunal expressly found that ischemic heart disease hastened, but was not the cause of, the Veteran's death and that, while the Veteran may have died when he did rather than some hours or days later because of his ischemic heart disease, the ischemic heart disease was not the cause or even one of the causes of his death.
