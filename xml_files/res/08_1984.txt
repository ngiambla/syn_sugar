 THE NATURE OF THE SCHEME Essentially the scheme involves the transfer to Gordian Runoff Limited, another insurer in runoff mode, of all Cavell's liabilities for a price approximately equal to the value of those liabilities.
 First, in March 2008 Enstar and another entity, JCF Fund 2 Limited Partnership, acquired, respectively, 70% and 30% of the beneficial ownership of Gordian from companies associated with the AMP group of companies in Australia.
 In my opinion it will be a matter for APRA to assess for itself whether such a departure from its published prudential standards should be allowed on the merits of whatever application is made.
 But the operation of Div 3A of Pt III of the Insurance Act concentrates on the position of affected policy holders and their being given information about the consequences as a result of a proposed scheme.
