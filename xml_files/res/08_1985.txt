 Counsel for Mr Harding properly accepted that no case in misrepresentation which was actionable as against the Australian Taxation Officer, or the Deputy Commissioner, could be sustained if the evidence was confined to the statements apparently made by Mr McClure.
 The rejection of the two suggested " cross-claims " or " cross demands " as formulated on behalf of Mr Harding makes it unnecessary to address the further submission as to whether any such " counter-claim " or " cross demand " " could ... have [been] set up in the action or proceeding " in the District Court.
 The final submission was that, even if it were to be concluded that the requirements of s 40(1)(g) had not been satisfied, the Court retained a discretion to set aside a bankruptcy notice if it was considered " just " to do so.
