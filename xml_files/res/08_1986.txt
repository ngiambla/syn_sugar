 Indeed, it could also have been advanced on behalf of Mr Rickus that a Cross-Claim has been accepted as itself constituting a " proceeding " in its own right such that in the present matter before the Court there may have been two " proceedings ": cf Aussie Home Security Pty Ltd v Sales Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 498 at [5] , [2000] FCA 498 ; 172 ALR 141 at 143 per Katz J.
 Had compliance with the statutory demand exposed Mr Rickus to a claim (for example) of breach of duty, s 255 would have prevented him being liable for that breach. 89 But s 299 is not a provision which absolves a person upon whom a s 255 notice has been served from all other duties or requirements otherwise imposed upon him.
