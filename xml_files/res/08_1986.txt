 His construction seizes upon the fact that the indemnity which he seeks to invoke is not confined to an indemnity in relations to " claims " that may be made; his construction seizes upon the language of clause 2.2, which confers an indemnity " against any liability for legal costs ".
 Indeed, it could also have been advanced on behalf of Mr Rickus that a Cross-Claim has been accepted as itself constituting a " proceeding " in its own right such that in the present matter before the Court there may have been two " proceedings ": cf Aussie Home Security Pty Ltd v Sales Systems Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 498 at [5] , [2000] FCA 498 ; 172 ALR 141 at 143 per Katz J.
 It may be considered to be a curious result if a director of a company could otherwise escape the application of s 199A(3)(a) by simply filing a Cross-Claim in any " proceeding " in which a " liability " is sought to be established and inviting the Court to enter judgment -- either for or against him -- in the Cross-Claim and not the originating application.
 Had compliance with the statutory demand exposed Mr Rickus to a claim (for example) of breach of duty, s 255 would have prevented him being liable for that breach. 89 But s 299 is not a provision which absolves a person upon whom a s 255 notice has been served from all other duties or requirements otherwise imposed upon him.
