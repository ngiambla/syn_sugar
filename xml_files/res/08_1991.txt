 Mr Cassimatis says that he intended that the Bank would regard this as a generous offer by Storm because Storm would take on the primary liability itself in a direct relationship with the Bank. 29 That proposal was put to the Bank on the evening of 4 December 2008 by Storm.
 I am satisfied that solely for interlocutory purposes, Storm has demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success in terms of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill demonstrating that the statement as to sole management of the margin loan accounts and instructions allegedly given in the meeting on 4 December 2008 are capable of being misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.
 Storm says that it only complains about that as a statement which reinforces the notion that Storm as manager of the margin loan has failed to discharge its responsibilities. 45 The Bank has not offered any undertaking not to make any of the statements complained of. 46 Storm says that it has experienced many responses from clients in response to the Bank's letter of 8 and 9 December 2008.
