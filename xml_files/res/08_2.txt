 In the last mentioned letter it declined mediation. 3 In its costs submissions the appellant calculated its costs of the trial on the scale under Federal Magistrates Court Regulations 2000 (Cth), sch 1, at $22,078.
 In final submissions on the appeal the appellant did not seek (apart from additional damages) more than the sum awarded, $3,684.20. 11 On the other hand, it is true to say that the appellant had to invoke the appeal process to remedy an erroneous judgment against it.
 There will be no order for the costs of the appeal. 13 As to interest, the appellant should have an award of interest at 10.5 per cent under s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
