 I also observe the necessity to take account of relevant distinctions between different contraveners in the context of the deterrence principle, which informs the penalties that are imposed. 6 As with each of the other parties who have been dealt with, it is not disputed that Ms Jung and Ms Cabalt were unaware that they were breaking the law by entering into, and being involved in, the implementation of the agreements not to offer discounted tuition fees.
 Ms Cabalt is no longer involved in the business. 9 In the circumstances, having regard to the deterrence requirement and the relevant distinctions between Nanuri and the other respondents and the factors I have mentioned, I will impose a penalty on Ms Jung of $3,000 in respect of each admitted contravention, making a total of $9,000.
