 It is apparent that this email was sent 11 days before Mr Duncan swore his affidavit on 7 October 2008, and some 10 days before Mr Stirrup, as the sole director of Total, resolved to appoint administrators to Total.
 I infer from the lack of any mention of this matter in that affidavit, that Mr Duncan had not been told by Mr Stirrup that these two significant events had occurred prior to his appointment.
