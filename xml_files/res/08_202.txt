 The WCNI has, therefore, taken the step of coming to this court as a supporting creditor. 4 WNCI seeks to have its costs as supporting creditor paid out of the winding-up of the defendant company, but it wishes to have these costs include the costs of the application which was made in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. 5 Coincidentally, both the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and WCNI's solicitors, sought to have the same firm of accountants, Messrs Simms Partners, or more accurately a person from that firm, appointed as the liquidator of the company.
 It follows that I propose to accede to the application made to me by Mr Davis of counsel for WCNI. 13 Mr Davis's instructing solicitor is in Court and he has informed me that when the Supreme Court proceedings are returnable on 6 March, an order will be sought that the proceedings be dismissed, with no order as to costs.
 Plainly, the Supreme Court could not now entertain the application to wind-up the company, because I will make a winding-up order this afternoon and in light of the course proposed today, the obvious approach in the Supreme Court is that there be no order as to costs sought in that matter.
 Mr Davis's instructing solicitor has undertaken to the Court to seek those orders in the Supreme Court on 6 March 2008. 14 Accordingly, the orders that I will make this afternoon are as set out in [1] to [3] of the originating process filed by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation on 24 January 2008.
