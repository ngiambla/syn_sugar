 This morning an affidavit has been filed on information and belief by Stacey Heath, which deposes to some oral arrangements entered into by the principal of the defendant, Mr Murat Coskun, and another gentleman, the effect of which is that a 10 per cent interest in the company has been purchased by Mr Pezkan Cosgun, an incoming investor.
 However, because the arrangements are not documented, depend upon oral arrangements, and are otherwise largely undefined, I propose to adjourn the hearing of the application until 10.15 on 12 March, by which time I would expect to have before me an affidavit which deposes to a written agreement which evidences a legally binding obligation on the part of the purchaser to pay the balance of the purchase funds within 14 days of today, which would be of course 14 March 2008. 3 In reliance upon that material, I will then consider whether the matter ought to be adjourned for a further week to enable moneys to be paid and cleared.
 However, I should emphasise that unless these arrangements are documented in a properly enforceable form and there is a serious prospect that the funds will be paid and cleared by 14 March 2008, then the real probability is that on 12 March 2008 I will make orders for winding up.
