 There has been no appearance upon the matter being called for the second time. 2 The plaintiff has provided a list of materials which are read on the application, and has provided a chronology and written submissions in relation to the merits in support of the making of a winding up order.
 Prior to the matter being called on this morning the defendant had provided submissions through lawyers Groom Lavers and in those submissions the proposition was being advanced that there are special circumstances which would warrant the application being adjourned. 3 Without descending into all the detail of the matter, there has been a history of negotiations between representatives of the defendant and financiers, including Macquarie Bank, and others, to raise money to enable the plaintiff's claim to be discharged.
 That payment apparently was made in the context of anticipated fruitful refinancing arrangements. 4 Upon the failure of those arrangements and the dishonouring of the cheque, the defendant apparently has engaged in other discussions with a view to securing a sale of an asset described as its "rent roll".
 Secondly, I am not satisfied, in any event, that they constitute special circumstances, particularly having regard to the payment to the Commissioner of a cheque in discharge of a liability which has been dishonoured upon presentation.
