 I also have before me an application by the defendant for an adjournment of the application on the footing that over some period of time there has been before the Deputy Commissioner an application by companies within the consolidated group of companies, of which Video and Audio (Australia) Pty Ltd is one, for a refund of GST which would, if paid, fall in for the benefit of this defendant.
 The amount of tax due to the plaintiff is, as at 15 January 2008, $224,400.92, and there are increments upon that amount as between 15 January and today. 2 If the tax audit conducted by the Deputy Commissioner results in a favourable determination to the defendant, an amount of 441,000-odd dollars would become payable to either the defendant or entities within the consolidated group.
