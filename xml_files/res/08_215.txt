 It follows that this decision of the Tribunal is a privative clause decision or a purported privative clause decision and not a "non-privative clause decision" as defined in s 474(6) of the Migration Act . 6 Sections 476 and 476A of the Migration Act provide for the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court on judicial review of, relevantly, decisions of the Tribunal.
 An appeal to the Federal Court under section 44 is available in relation to a non-privative clause decision. 23 The 2005 amendments conferred exclusive jurisdiction for judicial review of Tribunal migration decisions as between the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. 24 The explanatory memoranda do not assist the applicant.
 In any event, there was no determination that the Court did have jurisdiction despite s 483 of the Migration Act . 26 There have, however, been other decisions of the Court where the effect of s 483 has been considered on appeal from the Tribunal and in the context of business visa decisions.
 In SHCB v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 308 ; (2003) 133 FCR 561 , not a business visa case, the Full Court held at [5] that, if the Tribunal decision was a privative clause decision, there was no right of appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act by reason of the operation of s 483.
