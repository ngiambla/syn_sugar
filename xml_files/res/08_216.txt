 On that date that Court dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 2 The decision of the Tribunal was signed on 29 December 2005 and handed down on 17 January 2006.
 There had thus been compliance with the requirement imposed by s 477(1): cf Minister for Immigration Citizenship v SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 at [1] . 6 The Federal Magistrates Court in its 5 November 2007 decision concluded that proceedings had not been commenced within the time prescribed from the date of actual notification.
 In that decision Giles J agreeing with Buchanan J said: That an actual notification to an applicant of a decision requires physical delivery of a written statement of the decision prepared by the Refugee Review Tribunal to the applicant.
 He also acknowledges that an extension of time is also required: cf Nguyen v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 38 at [18] . 10 It is considered that leave to appeal should be refused, as should an extension of time.
