 The application was rejected because it was, at relevant times, a requirement that applicants for the grant of Australian citizenship be permanent residents of Australia: see s 13(1)(a) of the Act.
 Although the hearing report records a decision that the Tribunal had "no jurisdiction" I understand this to mean that there was no valid application before the Tribunal because the applicant had no entitlement to make the application.
