(e) By publishing the email of 28 March 2007, Mr Chatham in alleged breach of Order 5(e)(iv) denigrated an employee of Amway, namely Mr Greig (the applicants rely on the email as a whole, and in particular the paragraphs numbered 24 in the copy of the document annexed and marked `B') ('the eighth charge').
 Email of 2 April 2007 (f) On 2 April 2007, Mr Chatham published to Doug deVos, Steve Van Andel, Tony Greig, Peter Williams and Jim Payne an electronic mail with an attached document (the email and the attachment being, collectively, 'the email of 2 April 2007'). (g) By publishing the email of 2 April 2007, Mr Chatham in alleged breach of Order 5(e)(iv) denigrated or disparaged an employee of Amway namely Mr Greig (the applicants rely on the email as a whole, and in particular the paragraphs numbered 9, 11, 14, 16, 17 in the copy of the document annexed and marked 'C') ('the ninth charge'). (h) By publishing the email of 2 April 2007, Mr Chatham, in alleged breach of Order 5(e)(i) represented that Mr Greig had committed perjury, and alternatively made a statement to similar effect (the applicants rely on the email as a whole, and in particular the paragraphs numbered 10 to 13 in the copy of the document annexed and marked 'C') ('the tenth charge'). (i) By publishing the email of 2 April 2007, Mr Chatham, in alleged breach of Order 5(f) represented that Mr Greig had engaged in criminal conduct (the applicants rely on the email as a whole, and in particular the paragraphs numbered 10 to 13 in the copy of the document annexed and marked 'C') ('the eleventh charge') .
 For Mr Chatham it is said that nowhere in the email is 'Amway' mentioned; the complaints are directed against a company described as 'IDA'. 72 While it is true that there is no specific mention of 'Amway', it is also true that the references to 'IDA' are confined to paragraphs 5, 6 and 8.
 I find that he intended to denigrate or disparage Amway and the way it currently conducts its business activities in the eyes of those to whom he published the email of 12 April 2007, but to do so in a way which did not breach Orders 5(b) and 5(e)(iv).
