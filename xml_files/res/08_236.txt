 THE FIRST REVIEWABLE DECISION: THE SHOULDER/ UPPER BACK CLAIM 13 The Tribunal determined that Mr Sellick had suffered and continued to suffer the effects of an aggravation of a degenerative spine condition and a sprain of the interspinous ligament which arose out of his employment with Australia Post.
 The Tribunal was satisfied that the proper interpretation of the claim made by Mr Sellick was a claim for an injury which caused pain in the upper back, which included pain in the area of the right scapula.
 Accordingly, I shall deal with each particular only once. 20 Australia Post contends that, under the SRC Act, the only relevant injury is the injury for which a claim was made, namely the injury to the shoulder.
