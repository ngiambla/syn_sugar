 It is plain that the amended application is a disagreement with the findings and conclusions of the Tribunal and therefore seeks merits review which this Court cannot undertake. ... [16] The findings and conclusions made by the Tribunal were open to it on the evidence and material before it and for which it provided reasons. [17] The decision of the Tribunal is not affected by jurisdictional error and is therefore a private clause decision.
 There was no transcript of the Tribunal proceedings available before the Federal Magistrate and, in the absence of a transcript, it is unlikely that the account given by the Tribunal would have been rejected by that Court or, for that matter, this Court. 20 A further issue which at one stage arose for resolution was the fate of the Appellant husband's application.
 The Federal Magistrate concluded that there was " no need to disturb the RRT's findings in this regard ". 22 Shortly before the hearing of the appeal, namely on 29 February 2008, the appellant husband filed a Notice of Discontinuance of his appeal.
