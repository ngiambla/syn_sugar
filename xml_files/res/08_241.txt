 The "adoption" and "incorporation" cases ultimately proceed on the basis that because the applicant invited the Tribunal to take particular material into account, he or she can be taken to have given it to the Tribunal.
 See, for example, M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131 at [25] , SZEEU (2006) 150 FCR at [91] and [179] and NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; (2006) 156 FCR 419 at [51] ( NBKT ). 16 The present case is not one of incorporation or adoption.
