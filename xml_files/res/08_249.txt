 It was not applied in the preparation of the financial statements of Envestra as the head company of the consolidated group, nor in the preparation of the financial statements of Envestra or its subsidiary companies for the year ended 30 June 2003 prepared to comply with their accounting obligations under the Corporations Act .
 Had they done so, it is also common ground that the deferred tax liabilities of ESL and EQL measured in accordance with the 1999 AASB 1020 would have been liabilities of ESL and EQL under s 705 - 70 (1) of the ITAA for the purpose of working out the allocable cost amount of each of ESL and EQL joining the Envestra consolidated group.
