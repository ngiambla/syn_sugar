 They submitted that, in fact, they had no choice but to make submissions in opposition to the application for separate trials after the applicants applied for an additional order during the submissions on 18 and 19 January 2007.
 Selected Seeds' application should be granted in preference to that of Mr Michael Gargan because its application was the first in time and, more importantly, its proposed defence does not contain a plea as to the proportionate liability provisions which I have concluded is not arguable.
 Having regard to these circumstances, the appropriate order in relation to the hearing on 13 July 2007 is that there be no order as to costs. 29 The other costs of Selected Seeds' application for leave to defend should be reserved.
