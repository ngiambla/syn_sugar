 BACKGROUND 1 This purports to be an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 11 December 2007 dismissing an application for reinstatement of a proceeding that was dismissed by the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 October 2007 for non-appearance: see [2007] FMCA 1251. 2 The "appellants" are citizens of Malaysia, who arrived in Australia on 22 November 2006.
 The appellant claimed that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction or failed to exercise its jurisdiction, and denied the appellant natural justice and procedural fairness as it was biased and failed to investigate the appellant's claims. 9 On 15 October 2007 the application was called on for hearing.
