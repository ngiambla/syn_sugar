 The Tribunal also did not accept the appellant received threatening phone calls in 2000 due to his wife's employment because she had worked at the school since 1994, yet only started receiving threats in 2000.
 The appellants rely on SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 and SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 per Allsop J at [225].
