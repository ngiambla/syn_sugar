 We seek your immediate agreement to the provision of this sum for further security by 10.00 am on Wednesday 28 November 2007. ' 6 On the morning of Thursday, 29 November 2007 the solicitors for the applicant sent a facsimile communication to the solicitors for the first, second and third respondents indicating the consent of the applicant to an order for the provision of further security for costs.
 However, it seems clear to me, especially when one has regard to the time at which the letter of 29 November 2007 was sent by the solicitors for the applicant to the solicitors for the first, second and third respondents, that that was how the offer to provide further security for costs in the sum of $40,000 should be construed.
