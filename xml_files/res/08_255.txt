 The claims made against Mr Brendas include that, as a director of CRD, he had a duty to the company to act in its interests and to avoid putting himself in a position where his personal interests conflicted with the interests of the company.
 It was resolved at a meeting that any members of the Horse Park 2 joint venture who wished to participate as beneficiaries of the litigation should each contribute an amount of $10,000 towards the cost of the litigation payable immediately and a further $10,000 at a later time if required by CRD.
 It was also resolved that CRD would approach a litigation funder to make up any shortfall in the cost of the litigation and to provide security to cover the risk of any cost orders that might be made against CRD if the litigation is not successful.
