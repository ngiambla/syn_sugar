 The Tribunal told the applicant that it accepted that there was discrimination and sometimes persecution of ethnic people in his country but it had to decide about him and what happened/will happen to him. 8 The Tribunal accepted the appellant was of Roma ethnicity as he claimed.
 Application in the Federal Magistrates Court 11 On 16 February 2007 the appellant applied for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision by filing an application in the Federal Magistrates Court asserting there was a breach of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) and that there was no basis for the credibility findings made by the Tribunal.
 It follows that there is no error in finding that the appellant provided that relevant information to the Tribunal pursuant to s 424A(3)(b): NBKT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCAFC 195 ; 156 FCR 419. 33 The decision of Rares J in SZGGT [2006] FCA 435 to which the appellant has referred does not assist the appellant.
