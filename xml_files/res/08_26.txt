 Since the Rules provide for seven days for filing an application for leave to appeal and 15 days had elapsed by 21 December 2007, some urgency attached to ensuring that any foreshadowed application would be filed and served promptly and accordingly, the respondents were ordered to file and serve any proposed application by 2 January 2008.
 Notably, there is no matter deposed to by Mr Abercrombie on information and belief or directly, as to the circumstances which might explain the delay in failing to file an application for leave to appeal within seven days after 6 December 2007. 5 The period of delay beyond the seven day period represents a period from 13 December 2007 to 21 December 2007 which is eight days.
