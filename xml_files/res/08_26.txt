 Since the Rules provide for seven days for filing an application for leave to appeal and 15 days had elapsed by 21 December 2007, some urgency attached to ensuring that any foreshadowed application would be filed and served promptly and accordingly, the respondents were ordered to file and serve any proposed application by 2 January 2008.
 Notably, there is no matter deposed to by Mr Abercrombie on information and belief or directly, as to the circumstances which might explain the delay in failing to file an application for leave to appeal within seven days after 6 December 2007. 5 The period of delay beyond the seven day period represents a period from 13 December 2007 to 21 December 2007 which is eight days.
 By para 31 the applicants say that in the circumstances of the particulars pleaded in paras 22 and 30 of the SoC an inference arises that Jefferson and Stevenson, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, the BSA and the liquidator of Delvine were creditors for large sums of money; a time would come for payment of those monies by Waters; and Waters would not be able to pay.
 The effect properly asserted is a diminution in the pool of assets available for payment of then present creditors and future creditors. 25 Having regard to all of these matters, I am not satisfied that the applicants on the motion have demonstrated a failure on the part of the pleader (by failing to provide further particulars) to establish a relationship between the transactions, the intention to be drawn from those transactions, the giving effect to the scheme in relation to properly identified present or future creditors, and the diminution in the pool of assets available to satisfy those claims. 26 Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the primary decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant reconsideration by the Full Court.
