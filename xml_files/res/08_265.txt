 The ACCC relies upon a decision of a Full Court in Kotan Holdings Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1991) 30 FCR 511. 14 The ACCC also contends that even if there is a legitimate forensic purpose in the production of the documents, certain redacted portions of them are subject to a claim for legal professional privilege.
 All documents created by Paul Taylor, Mark Quinane, Mark Pearson or Lee Hollis, or recording communications between two or more of them, from 1 September to 31 October 2007 evidencing, comprising, recording or referring to: (a) the possible commencement of proceedings by the Respondent against the Applicant (including documents relating to the Settlement Strategy); (b) the reasons for recommending that the Chairman of the Respondent issue the Notice to the Applicant.
 In my view, their Honours' remarks on this topic, though no doubt central to the question at the final hearing, do not assist the ACCC on the question of the Notice to Produce. 42 What [8] of KAL's statement of issues leaves open for determination on the final hearing, is who, in the present case, comprised the Commission.
