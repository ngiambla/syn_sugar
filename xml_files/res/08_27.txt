 The registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to Part 3 of the Act, the exclusive rights to use the trade mark (and authorise others to use the trade mark) in relation to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered (s 20(1))).
 Section 120(1) provides relevantly, that a person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses, as a trade mark, a sign that is substantially identical with the trade mark in relation to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
 If those rights are a sub-set of broader exclusive rights, there may be good reason not to cancel the registration of the trade mark so as to enable the registered owner to enjoy other rights conferred by registration of the trade mark.
 At the moment in time when the registered owner applied for the trade mark, that shape was emblematic of a fence dropper made and sold by the applicant containing an S loop which was commonly known as the S dropper.
