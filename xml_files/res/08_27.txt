 The registered owner of the trade mark has, subject to Part 3 of the Act, the exclusive rights to use the trade mark (and authorise others to use the trade mark) in relation to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered (s 20(1))).
 Section 120(1) provides relevantly, that a person infringes a registered trade mark if the person uses, as a trade mark, a sign that is substantially identical with the trade mark in relation to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
