 The third is damages for the loss of bargain on the basis that, but for alleged breaches and repudiation of the relevant lease by the applicants, Rosanza would have retained ownership of the premises at least until some time between 12 September 2009 and 2 March 2010, and in that period would have received the benefit of the lease, including rent less expenses.
 Finally, Rosanza claims for loss in respect of legal and other costs in connection with the default under the lease by the second applicant/first cross-respondent. 5 The crux of the applicants' application is that Rosanza in its cross-claim seeks damages for the loss of bargain of the lease and, despite the property having been sold on 12 September 2007, quantifies and particularises these damages by reference to the rent it would have received after this date.
