 That application was refused on 7 December 2006 and the now Appellant lodged an application for review with the Migration Review Tribunal on 28 December 2006. 2 The Migration Review Tribunal on 19 June 2007 affirmed the decision not to grant a Bridging A (Class WA) visa.
 The Appellant did not satisfy cl 010.211(3)(c) as he was not the holder of a bridging visa A or B; he did not satisfy cl 010.211(4)(b) as he had applied for a protection visa; and there was no evidence that he had applied for a class of visa prescribed by cl 010.211(5)(a) or (6)(a).
 It may well be that the matters set forth are more in the nature of the thought processes or reasoning of the Tribunal: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.
 In the present case, the refusal of leave to amend and the refusal of relief, even if a breach be established, is an exercise of discretion that " is proper, prudent, economical and just ": [2007] HCA 26 at [87] per Kirby J. 16 None of the Grounds of Appeal is made out. 17 Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
