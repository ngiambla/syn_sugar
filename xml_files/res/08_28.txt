 The investigation was said to concern suspected contraventions of s 816 of the WR Act by Mr Setka and Mr McLoughlin at four named construction sites. 19 After correspondence between the ABCC and the legal officer of Mr Washington's union, the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union ("CFMEU"), the ABCC, by letter dated 22 October 2007, withdrew the notice dated 28 September 2007 directed to Mr Washington. 20 On 30 October 2007, the ABCC served a further notice on Mr Washington dated 29 October 2007.
 The letter alleged that Mr Setka had harassed and intimidated the officers, and requested an assurance that such behaviour was not endorsed by the ACTU, and that Mr Setka would be counselled in relation to it. 22 On 20 September 2007, Mr Hadgkiss again wrote to the ACTU.
 They submit that that is the substantial concern of the investigation and not the alleged breaches of s 816 of the WR Act . 34 Counsel point to the correspondence from Mr Hadgkiss to the ACTU complaining about Mr Setka's conduct and to the reference in the "Herald Sun" to an alleged incident the subject of the investigation.
