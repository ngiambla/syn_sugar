 It is fair to say, as Comcare submits, that Mr Maganga's credibility loomed large in the proceedings. 2 During the course of the Tribunal hearing, Comcare sought leave to inspect certain summonsed documents which related to a previous injury.
 Comcare argues that if the summonsed documents showed there was only one left knee injury in 1997, this, together with cross-examination on the summonsed documents, would have reflected on Mr Maganga's reliability and credit in this Tribunal hearing and demonstrated that he had lied to Comcare and to the Tribunal.
