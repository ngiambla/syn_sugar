 INTRODUCTION 1 The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') determined that Mr Maganga is entitled to compensation in respect of an injury to his left knee, said by him to have been sustained while he was on his way to work.
 It is fair to say, as Comcare submits, that Mr Maganga's credibility loomed large in the proceedings. 2 During the course of the Tribunal hearing, Comcare sought leave to inspect certain summonsed documents which related to a previous injury.
 Comcare argues that if the summonsed documents showed there was only one left knee injury in 1997, this, together with cross-examination on the summonsed documents, would have reflected on Mr Maganga's reliability and credit in this Tribunal hearing and demonstrated that he had lied to Comcare and to the Tribunal.
 Mr Maganga also refers to Fried where Weinberg J set aside a subpoena where it was agreed that the only purpose for which the documents were sought was to attack the credit of a witness (at [21]---[30]).
