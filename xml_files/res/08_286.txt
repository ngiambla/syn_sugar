 See also Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 , (2003) 195 ALR 225 at [25] ( Bienstein ). 11 In Carr , Mason J (at 253 to 254) referred to the decision of Gibbs J in Licul and observed that that approach had been adopted and applied in Anshun No 1.
 In the process, it considered (at [39] and [40]) the decisions of Anshun No 1 , Re Luck and Tampion and concluded (at [43]) that there was no inconsistency between the decisions of Anshun No 1 and Re Luck because each applied to its own facts, specifically the judgments under appeal each had a different basis.
 The latter case was the kind discussed in Tampion and Re Luck, but, as the judgment in Anshun [No 1] makes clear, Tampion and therefore Re Luck do not concern the former kind of case, with which we are concerned here. 15 One question that was not expressly dealt with in the cases referred to above is whether a dismissal on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction is a final or an interlocutory order.
