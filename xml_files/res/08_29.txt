 The term "agreement in writing" shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. 16 The definition of "arbitration agreement" incorporates Art II of the Convention thus requiring an undertaking or commitment by the parties by agreement to submit "all or any differences ... concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration".
 I first briefly mention the fourth element referred to in [12] above. 21 The issue as to the proper construction and application of the Agreement in the circumstances which have arisen is, in my view, in the terms of the concluding words of the first paragraph of Art II cl 1 of the Convention, a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration.
 It argued only that the Agreement, including cl 4.3 and cl 7.1 and cl 7.4, on its proper construction does not oblige it to accept and meet the applicant's purchase orders during the first year of the term because, for some unidentified reason, the credit insurance it had in place for the first year of the term has been withdrawn or partly withdrawn.
