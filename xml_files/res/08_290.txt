 When the Town of Batchelor No 2 application was first instituted, he was one of the named applicants on behalf of the King Brown Snake clan, but following its amendment he was removed as an applicant and the King Brown Snake clan was removed as a clan or group on whose behalf that claim was brought.
 I am mindful of the fact that relevant communications on 1 December 2005 were between the solicitor for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and for the NLC on the one hand, and an officer of the Registrar, but referred only to a submission from the NLC.
 The Town of Batchelor No 1 applications contend that the material available to the Registrar could not satisfy him that the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are members of that native title claim group and are authorised to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it by all the other members in the native title claim group.
 But neither of those documents, having regard to their contents and to the documents accompanying them, is in my view sufficient to satisfy the Registrar that each of the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants is authorised to make the application by the other persons in the claim group.
