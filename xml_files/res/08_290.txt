 The Town of Batchelor No 1 applications contend that the material available to the Registrar could not satisfy him that the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are members of that native title claim group and are authorised to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it by all the other members in the native title claim group.
 But neither of those documents, having regard to their contents and to the documents accompanying them, is in my view sufficient to satisfy the Registrar that each of the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants is authorised to make the application by the other persons in the claim group.
