 THE PRESENT ISSUE 8 By motion of the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants (the first applicants), they seek orders pursuant to s 84C(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act) that the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, as now amended, be struck out.
 The applicants in the Town of Batchelor No 1 application are parties to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, by reason of s 84(3) of the Act, as they claim to hold native title in relation to the land or waters in the same claim area as that covered by the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and having followed the procedure prescribed by s 84.
 He says so, and Mr Petherick in effect acknowledges that. 31 The thrust of the material presented through Mr Petherick is that the FRBG is a separate claim group, made up of a number of clans, who claim native title rights and interests within the Batchelor area and surrounding areas.
 The extensive process of consultation to which he refers does not indicate that at any particular meeting or meetings he was expressly authorised by the identified native title claim group to bring the Town of Bachelor No 2 application on its behalf or to deal with matters in relation to it.
