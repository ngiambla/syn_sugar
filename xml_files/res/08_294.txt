 I note that the size and shape do vary depending upon the number of digits that are used, but they are all considerably smaller plates than the standard number plate, examples of which have been provided to me for observation.
 The second difference is the fact that the black V on white appears and that, of course, does not appear on the Heritage Plates. 11 I should note that, from the plates that I have been provided with, there is a further difference.
 I note that, in the auction catalogue that I have already referred to which is concerned with the auction tomorrow night, although the other plates that constitute lots in the auction have a guiding monetary range adjacent to them, the V-Series plates do not.
 The two applicants have indicated a willingness to give undertakings as to damages, such that if the other plates, the V-Series plates, are not offered for auction tomorrow night, and damage to the respondent ensues they will be responsible for the payment of compensation.
