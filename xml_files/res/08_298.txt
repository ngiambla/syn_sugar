 Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ there observed at 195: It should not be overlooked that r 15(2) enables leave to be given "at any time"; the "special reasons" relevant to such a power cannot but describe an elastic test, suitable for application across a range of situations, from an oversight of a day to a neglect persisted in during a prolonged period.
 It would require something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave after, for example, a year; equally, it may be said, something much less significant might justify leave where a party is a few days late. "Special reasons" must be understood in a sense capable of accommodating both types of situation.
 The conclusions of the Tribunal, for example, included the finding in respect to one claim that: ...The Tribunal considers this fanciful and far-fetched claim quite typical of the kind of ill-conceived ambits presented by the Applicant in the course of this case.
 The Tribunal does not accept on the evidence before it that the Applicant's travel to the UAE was other than employment-motivated. 9 The Federal Magistrates Court reviewed the decision of the Tribunal and found no error in the conclusions of the Tribunal.
