 The present Application for Leave to Appeal was heard concurrently with an Application for Leave to Appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court in SZLJM v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1945.
 The legal representatives for the Applicant in both proceedings and the Respondent Minister were the same and there was no opposition to the two Applications proceeding together. 5 The proceedings in SZLJM , supra , involved decisions made under s 417 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), whereas the present proceedings involve decisions made under s 351.
 There is no relevant distinction between either ss 351 or 417 and no distinction between the present case and the decision in Raikua v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 , 158 FCR 510.
