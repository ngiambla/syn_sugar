 1 In May 2007 the Applicant requested the Minister to exercise his discretion under s 351 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). 2 That application was refused and the Applicant again applied for an exercise of the discretion in November 2007.
 There is no relevant distinction between either ss 351 or 417 and no distinction between the present case and the decision in Raikua v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2007] FCA 370 , 158 FCR 510.
 It is considered that the application has no prospects of success for the reasons given in SZJLM v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FCA 300. 7 The Respondent Minister seeks costs, being those estimated in an Affidavit on a party-party basis to be $1,800.
