 There is no suggestion in the evidence that the Minister intended anything other than that provided the officer in good faith formed the view that the 'unique or 'exceptional circumstances' criterion was not met, the Minister did not wish to consider exercising his s 417(1) power.
 Secondly, as was clear from s 417(7) of the Act, the Minister had no duty to consider the power under s 417, and therefore relief could not have been granted in the Court below even if there had been jurisdiction to consider the application.
 An application for special leave to appeal from His Honour's decision has been dismissed: SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs [2007] HCA Trans 759. 9 There is considered to be no relevant distinction between the facts of the present case and the facts before Lindgren J.
 His Honour's conclusion, with respect, is considered to be manifestly correct. 10 Nothing is gained by a further review of either the provisions of ss 417 , 474 or 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) or the authorities. 11 The present Application , it may be noted, was heard concurrently with another Application for Leave to Appeal involving s 351 of the 1958 Act.
