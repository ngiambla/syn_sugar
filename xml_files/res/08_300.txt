 1 This is an Application for Leave to Appeal against a decision given by the Federal Magistrates Court on 13 November 2007: SZLJM v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] FMCA 1945. 2 The Applicant in the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate sought to review a decision evidenced by a letter to the Applicant's solicitors dated 3 September 2007.
 Lindgren J analysed the position as follows: [62] The Minister could have decided not to consider any requests for the exercise of his power under s 417(1) for a specified period of time, and that decision would not have been subject to review.
 The applicants do not suggest that Ms Connolly did not act in good faith. [64] Ms Connolly's decision is not something provided for by the Act, and does not itself affect legal rights; cf Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 335---338.
