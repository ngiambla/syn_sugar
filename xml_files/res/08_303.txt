 I have now considered those submissions. 4 It was necessary for the receiver to make application for the orders relating to the funds and extensions of time but the hearing was lengthened by the respondent's opposition to the making of those orders.
 Thus, although a short hearing at the instance of the receiver was unavoidable the respondent's unsuccessful opposition to the making of the orders sought added to the time required for the parties' preparation and for the hearing. 5 In my view the appropriate order is that the respondent pay 50 per cent of the receiver's costs of the Amended Notice of Motion dated 4 February 2008.
 If the respondent does not comply with the order that he pay these costs the receiver should be entitled to be indemnified from the funds under his control to the extent of any default.
