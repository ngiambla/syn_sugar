 Order that on and from 19 December 2007 the Respondent use its best endeavours to remove the sticker containing the words "Lasts As Long As Energizer Duracell" or oversticker that sticker on all Current Varta High Energy Packaging located in retail stores and in any event ensure that by no later than 29 January 2008 all such stickers on such stock are removed or overstickered. 12.
 The clear implication of the orders made on 14 December 2007, as ultimately articulated in the reasons published on 8 February 2008, was that the dissemination to the public of the packaging containing the old sticker involved misleading or deceptive conduct proscribed by the Act.
 It is true that no order was made expressly requiring Remington to do anything about its packaging in relation to packets of batteries already in retail stores (and putting to one side an argument advanced by Energizer in contempt proceedings about the legal effect of one of the orders made on 14 December 2007) and that the retail stores were not themselves parties to those proceedings.
