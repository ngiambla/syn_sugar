 The first was made on 13 February 2007 and consisted of an offer to compromise the action on terms that Holcomm Marine pay to the plaintiffs the sum of $125,000, inclusive of interest, plus the plaintiffs' party-party costs.
 Accordingly, I indicated that there should be judgment for Holcomm Marine and that the proceeding should be dismissed. 9 The proceeding was conducted on the basis that the liability of Holcomm Marine to the plaintiffs was hotly contested.
 As I indicated in my reasons, Seaquest had been insured for a figure not much in excess of $100,000, although, for the reasons I indicated, that was not decisive as to its value at the time of loss.
 The plaintiffs should be ordered to pay Holcomm Marine's costs up to and including that day on the party-party basis, subject to one caveat. 19 The plaintiffs served a notice on Holcomm Marine to admit a number of facts.
