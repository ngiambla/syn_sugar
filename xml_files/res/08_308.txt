 The Tribunal found that the situation is worse for Biharis than for the general population and observed that the right to a basic education had become a luxury for Bihari children.
 The Tribunal accepted country information that indicated that the problems of the Biharis who live in camps in Bangladesh are not active hostility but lack of opportunity, neglect and poverty.
 The Tribunal found that, while some Biharis may have a well founded fear of persecution, the appellant is not one of them. 19 The Tribunal did not accept that there is a real chance that the appellant will suffer harm amounting to persecution should he return to Bangladesh in the foreseeable future.
