 The third respondent discussed this action with the applicant on 2 May 1997 and then on 6 May 1997, he decided that he could not allow the applicant to proceed with the applications development environment project because that project would involve the applicant working in close proximity to people he was pursuing by way of legal proceedings.
 For reasons I have already given, I am not satisfied that the fact that the applicant had commenced criminal and civil proceedings against the third respondent played any part in the opinion formed by the third respondent under s 63B of the PSA.
 The third ground of challenge is that the second respondent's decision involved an improper exercise of the power in s 61(2) in that the second respondent took irrelevant considerations into account in exercising the power and failed to take relevant considerations into account.
