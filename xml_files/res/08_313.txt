 The proposed amended cross-claim raises more complex issues. 4 Although counsel for the first and second respondents have disavowed any intention of pleading the amended cross-claim in a way that would raise the efficacy of what occurred in the course of curial proceedings in another matter that intention is not reflected in the proposed pleading and at a number of places reliance is placed on things said and done in the course of that other proceeding.
 If the respondents or some of them desire to raise this issue in the earlier proceeding then there are proper processes whereby that may be achieved and given that the issue has been raised at this stage the parties are free to take such steps as they are advised to protect their position, and in particular the first and second respondents may, if so advised, file and serve a notice of motion in the other proceeding designed to achieve the end that is sought. 7 But I note that counsel for the respondents have indicated that if those instructions are received and a notice of motion is filed they will not see to prosecute it until such time as the hearing and determination of the present proceeding.
 There are other allegations made in the draft amended cross-claim which it is asserted do not rely on in court conduct or statements, and I use that term to cover the ground that is covered by the immunity that is enjoyed by counsel and solicitors in relation to curial proceedings, that can found a cause of action under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for misleading statements and misrepresentations under the Trademarks Act 1995 (Cth).
 I will direct that the respondents file and serve revised annexures A and B to the notice of motion on or before 4 April 2008. 8 I will further direct that, on or before 14 March 2008, the applicants file and serve short submissions in support of the making of the orders appearing at paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the draft minutes of orders handed to the court on 29 February 2008. 9 On or before 4 April 2008 the respondents should file and serve short answering submissions and on or before 11 April 2008 the applicant is to file and serve any reply.
