 The specification speaks of disadvantages of damaged barrier elements, and then says: The present invention aims to alleviate at least one of the above disadvantages and to provide a barrier which will be reliable and efficient in use.
 In my opinion the Guardian Barrier System (and the barrier system described in the Wasserstrom Patent) and the barrier system described in the Kinabalu Patent both set out to solve or reduce problems caused by the impact from collisions.
