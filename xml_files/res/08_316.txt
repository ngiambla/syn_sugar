 There is thus a serious factual dispute, which includes whether the descendants of David Isaacs are descendants of the Duke of York; and if they are not, are they, nevertheless, Turrbal people who would need to be included in a properly constituted Turrbal claim group.
 There is simply no evidence that that method of decision making was the process of decision making required to be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group.
 The original application was not authorised by that process and, it seems to me, the alternative form of authorisation contended for factually is at odds with the primary contention of the applicant concerning authorisation, namely, that Ms Connie Isaacs as Elder had the authority of the native title claim group to make the original application, because that was the decision making process mandated by the traditional laws and customs of the native title claim group.
 The hearing of a s 66B motion is not the proper occasion to explore the broader issue as to whether or not a native title determination application was properly authorised in the first place for the purposes of s 61 and s 251B of the Act.
