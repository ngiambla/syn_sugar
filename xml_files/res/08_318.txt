 Having set aside the Commissioner's objection decision and found the determination addressed to Farrago did not support the amended assessment issued to Mr McCutcheon, the Tribunal exercised the power conferred on the Commissioner by s 177F and determined under s 177F(1)(a) that an amount of $1,616,406.00 be included in the assessable income of Mr Patrick McCutcheon for the income year ending 30 June 1998.
 The appellants say the Commissioner has not complied with the pre-condition upon which s 177F operates when it can be seen that multiple determinations have been made in respect of different taxpayers (not all of whom have been assessed to tax) where each determination relates to the 'one fund of money or one stream of income'.
 Finally, if the tax benefit is referable to an amount not included in the assessable income of Farrago as trustee in the relevant income year, the Commissioner may determine that the whole or part of that amount shall be included in the assessable income of Farrago for the relevant year of income.
