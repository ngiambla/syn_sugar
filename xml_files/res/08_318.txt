 Having set aside the Commissioner's objection decision and found the determination addressed to Farrago did not support the amended assessment issued to Mr McCutcheon, the Tribunal exercised the power conferred on the Commissioner by s 177F and determined under s 177F(1)(a) that an amount of $1,616,406.00 be included in the assessable income of Mr Patrick McCutcheon for the income year ending 30 June 1998.
 Note 3 to the financial statements of Farrago as trustee of the AM Trust for the year ended 30 June 2003 shows, for the year ending 30 June 1998, an unsecured loan at call by Farrago to Primemovers (NQ) Pty Ltd as trustee of the PM Trust of $1,130,000.00 and a loan of the same amount by Farrago to East Coast Circuits Pty Ltd as trustee of the ECCUT.
 On 16 April 2004, the Commissioner issued an amended assessment to the taxpayer in reliance upon the determination. 20 On 6 April 2004, the Commissioner's delegate determined under s 177F(1)(a) of the ITAA that $1,616,406.00 being a tax benefit referable to an amount not included in the assessable income of Mr Patrick McCutcheon for the year ending 30 June 1998 be included in the taxpayer's assessable income for that year.
 The appellants say that the Commissioner has a statutory obligation in acting in reliance upon s 177F to define the scheme by which a taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit and then determine in respect of the stream of assessable income comprising the tax benefit, the particular taxpayer that obtained the particular benefit.
 The appellants say in oral submissions that the Commissioner in that sense has 'one shot' at it. 24 The appellants accept that the Commissioner as a proper exercise of the power conferred by s 177F can make on the one hand a determination that postulates an amount not included in the assessable income of a taxpayer that would or might reasonably be expected to have been included in the assessable income of that taxpayer in the relevant year of income had the scheme not been implemented and, on the other hand, make a determination that also postulates, in the alternative, an amount not included in the assessable income of another taxpayer that would or might reasonably be expected to have been included in that taxpayer's assessable income had the scheme (in connection with the same amount) not been implemented.
 At the same time, the Commissioner has determined that Mr McCutcheon would or might reasonably be expected to have received 50% ($1,616,406.00) of the income stream dealt with by the scheme, as assessable income as a primary beneficiary of the P A Trust on the footing that had the scheme not been implemented, a reasonable prediction of future events involved a distribution by the trustee to each of the beneficiaries in the ratio 50/50.
 Finally, if the tax benefit is referable to an amount not included in the assessable income of Farrago as trustee in the relevant income year, the Commissioner may determine that the whole or part of that amount shall be included in the assessable income of Farrago for the relevant year of income.
 Farrago as trustee of the AM Trust obtains a tax benefit if an amount not included in the assessable income of Farrago (as trustee) is an amount that would have been included or might reasonably be expected to have been included in the assessable income of Farrago (as trustee) in the year of income, if the scheme had not been 'entered into' or 'carried out'.
 The Tribunal found that as to that hypothesis the taxpayers failed to advance evidence of what would otherwise have occurred and thus failed to discharge the onus cast upon the taxpayer of demonstrating that the assessment was excessive (s 14ZZO(b)(i) Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth)). 32 The alternative hypothesis said to enliven s 177F(a) was that had the scheme not been entered into or carried out, an amount of $3,232,813.00 would have been included or at least might reasonably have been expected to be included in the assessable income of Farrago.
 Mr McCutcheon goes on to say that the history of distributions by the trustee of the P A Trust shows that the bulk of the trust's income has been distributed to particular entities and only very small amounts have historically been distributed to Mr and Mrs McCutcheon or their daughters Sally and Claire McCutcheon.
 Moreover, Mr McCutcheon says that the P A Trust has a history of distributing large amounts of income to the trustee of the PGUT. 39 It seems to me that the Tribunal is entitled to receive into evidence the statement objected to by the respondent provided foundation facts are given in evidence which support what would otherwise be a bald speculative statement.
 The appellants say that the Tribunal disregarded the history of previous determinations; concluded that there was no evidence before the Tribunal upon which it could act in order to determine what the appellants would have done if the scheme had not been entered into or carried into effect; and concluded that it would be speculative to adopt the submissions of the appellants as to what might have happened had the scheme not been implemented.
