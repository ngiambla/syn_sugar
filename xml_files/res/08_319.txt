 The Tribunal was not obliged to comply with s 424A prior to the hearing under s 425: SZKLG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 198 (I do not believe the appellant argued that the Tribunal was obliged to do so); 4.
 Accordingly, no occasion now arises for this Court to determine whether that assumption was correct. [17] Secondly, the appellants assumed, but did not demonstrate, that the statutory declaration "would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review".
 It is squarely put by counsel for the appellant that the learned Magistrate was wrong in saying that because the Tribunal made no reference in its reasons to the $20,000 bond issue, s 424A imposed no obligation in relation to that issue.
 There can be no doubt the learned Magistrate relied on an examination of the Tribunal's reasons in concluding that it did not consider the $20,000 bond issue a reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review.
