 Such an option is of its nature unrelated to the tenant's estate or interest under the lease; it has no closer connexion with that estate or interest than that the parties to it happen also to be in the relationship of lessor and lessee of the subject land.
 The respondents referred to the fact that the previous option to purchase (that is, the option to purchase in the original lease between the owner of the property and Gunabee which had in fact expired) referred to the transfer, upon the option being exercised, of an unencumbered estate in fee simple.
 I mention only in passing because neither party referred to it that the contract for the sale and purchase of the business between the second respondent and the applicant also referred to an option to purchase to be granted in terms of an unencumbered estate in fee simple. 32 Both parties made submissions to the effect that the interpretation of the other party would lead to what was said to be an uncommercial result.
 The option to purchase in this case was exercised before the term referred to in the lease and it does not seem to me that the respondents' submission is a reason not to give effect to the conclusion I have reached. 33 Both questions should be answered in the affirmative.
