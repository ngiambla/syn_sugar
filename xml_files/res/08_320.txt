 Did Ms de Garcia's statutory declaration comply with the Regulations? 26 The first question is whether the Federal Magistrate erred in concluding that the Tribunal did not fall into jurisdictional error in the manner in which it dealt with the issue of Ms de Garcia's statutory declaration.
 Accordingly, Ms de Garcia's statutory declaration did not comply with the Regulations and, therefore, the first respondent's claim based on non-judicially determined domestic violence failed. 34 The Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal had not erred in its approach and conclusion. 35 In my view, the Federal Magistrate did not err in upholding the Tribunal's decision.
 The Tribunal, accordingly, affirmed the decision of the delegate. 46 The High Court found that there had been a denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal because the Tribunal had not identified to the applicant as potentially dispositive of the application, issues which had not been treated as dispositive by the delegate.
 Whether the Federal Magistrate erred in remitting the matter to the Tribunal for rehearing 60 The Minister contended that, notwithstanding his finding of jurisdictional error in relation to ground one of the grounds of review, the Federal Magistrate had erred in remitting the first respondent's application to the Tribunal for rehearing.
