 Counsel for the plaintiff refers to evidence given in the trial which confirmed that the plaintiff had an extremely strong case for the relief she sought from the Court. 4 The defendants resist the plaintiff's claim for indemnity costs.
 This includes the recognition that there are circumstances which justify the order of indemnity costs, including when a party unreasonably causes another party to incur costs; see Colgate-Palmolive at 233 and Leahy Petroleum at [17]. 6 Counsel for the defendants submit that, although his clients did not succeed in the substantive proceedings, it could not be said that they had no chance of success.
