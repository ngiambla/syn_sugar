 Senior counsel for Cadbury relies on s 119(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) which provides: Evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of: ... (b) the contents of a confidential document (whether delivered or not) that was prepared; for the dominant purpose of the client being provided with professional legal services relating to an Australian or overseas proceeding (including the proceeding before the court), or an anticipated or pending Australian or overseas proceeding, in which the client is or may be, or was or might have been, a party. 6 There is a clear line of authority which establishes that draft documents and other communications of a like nature with an expert witness proposed to be called in litigation are privileged under s 119(b) whatever may have been the position at common law: Natuna Pty Limited v Cook [2006] NSWSC 1367 ; New Cap Reinsurance Corporation Ltd (In Liq) 1 Or v Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd [2007] NSWSC 258 ; and ML Ubase Holdings Co Ltd v Trigem Computer Inc [2007] NSWSC 859. 7 Senior counsel for Darrell Lea does not dispute this proposition but relies on waiver, or rather its statutory equivalent in s 122(2) of the Evidence Act which provides: Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if a client or party has knowingly and voluntarily disclosed to another person the substance of the evidence and the disclosure was not made: (a) in the course of making a confidential communication or preparing a confidential document; or (b) as a result of duress or deception; or (c) under compulsion of law; or (d) if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding office under, an Australian law--to the Minister, or the Minister of the State or Territory, administering the law, or the part of the law, under which the body is established or the office is held. 8 The same question has been dealt with by Brereton J in ML Ubase at [45]-[46] where his Honour says: [45] In my view, what Enderby J said in Crawford v Bailey [(unreported, NSWSC, Enderby J, 26 October 1990)] is no longer the law, if it ever was.
 In my opinion, service and tender of an expert witness' report in proceedings does not constitute a waiver of the privilege which attaches to communications between the expert and the solicitors who instructed him or her, save to the extent that those communications are associated documents reasonably necessary to an understanding of the report. "Proper understanding" of a document or communication will sometimes, but not always require that documents to which it responds or refers be available.
 The test is concerned with the comprehensibility of the primary communication or document: if it can be completely or thoroughly understood without more, then access to the related communications or documents is not reasonably necessary. [46] Accordingly, for the purposes of s 126 , one starts by looking at the substantive document (made admissible under s 122 or another of the applicable sections) and asking whether, in order to understand it thoroughly, it is necessary to know what is in the associated material. 9 In the present case senior counsel for Darrell Lea has not been able to point to any particular part of Dr Stavros' report of which it can be said that some further document is required to enable the report to be understood.
