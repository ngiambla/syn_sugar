 The arrangements and events set out at length in the Summons are relied upon to establish the unfairness ground (referred to in the declaration as to unfairness embracing the OMB Agency Agreements as well as other contended arrangements and agreements) which anchors the right to relief sought under s 106 (relief is also sought pursuant to s 107 to prevent the Bank parties engaging in conduct to induce others to enter into OMB agency agreements).
 The OMB parties say that the point of these amendments is to 'make perfectly clear' that what is being asserted is arrangements that include arrangements between individuals as applicants and individuals as respondents in addition to issues between the OMB corporate entities and the Bank. 80 Counsel for the OMB parties contends that the amendments have been made as a matter of 'abundant caution in relation to the proposition that was being articulated ... earlier that what is being sought to be picked up is arrangements that travel outside or beyond, so to speak, the dealings between any two corporations or a constitutional corporation and any individual [so as] to catch arrangements where on both sides [there] are individuals, and also then deal with the collateral arrangements to those arrangements in the same way'.
 Those arrangements are truly derivative to the primary OMB agency agreements and the formal agreements such as the guarantees, securities and other documents related to those agreements. 85 One further matter should be mentioned. 86 The Bank parties say that the amendments made on 30 January 2008 to each of the Industrial Court proceedings by leave is an attempt to broaden the scope of the orders sought under s 106 of the IR Act and the field of arrangements and agreements made between individuals so as to advance the case for a cross-vesting order.
