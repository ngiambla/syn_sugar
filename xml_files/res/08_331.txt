 On 7 November 2007 there was filed a Further Amended Application . 2 The Further Amended Application seeks to challenge a notice issued under s 16 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 24 October 2006 and a determination that the Applicant be surrendered pursuant to s 22 of that Act.
 Given that the focus of any review of the decision of the Minister to issue the notice in October 2006 must be a scrutiny of the materials then before the Minister, being the materials upon which he formed his " opinion ", any further pursuit of this factual matter is considered neither relevant nor warranted.
 But the power or authority conferred on the magistrate in the present proceedings is a power or authority to make an " order " where a person has " inform [ed]" the magistrate that he consents and where the magistrate has no " reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily ".
 Less difficulty may be experienced in characterising as a " jurisdictional fact " a question as to whether a person has informed a magistrate of his consent; greater difficulty, however, may be experienced in characterising as " jurisdictional " whether a magistrate had " reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily" .
