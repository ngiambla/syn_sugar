 Section 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (' Judiciary Act ') confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court in any matter arising under any laws made by Parliament: 'other than a matter in respect of which a criminal prosecution is instituted or any other criminal matter. ' Thus the general conferral of jurisdiction in matters arising under Commonwealth law does not confer jurisdiction on the Court to hear and determine criminal matters. 6 Section 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act does not prevent Parliament from legislating in other enactments to confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear and determine specific classes of criminal matters or, indeed, criminal matters arising under any laws made by Parliament.
 The Federal Court Rules , O 49, sets out the procedures to be followed in a prosecution in the Federal Court for an offence. 7 However, there is no Commonwealth legislation conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear and determine criminal matters of the kind purportedly instituted by Mr Vescio.
 The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the criminal prosecutions initiated by him: cf Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (Cth), s 4(2) (confined to civil matters); Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) 198 CLR 511 (holding s 4(2) to be unconstitutional). 8 In these circumstances, the appropriate order is that the proceedings be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
