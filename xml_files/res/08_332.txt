 The Federal Court Rules , O 49, sets out the procedures to be followed in a prosecution in the Federal Court for an offence. 7 However, there is no Commonwealth legislation conferring jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear and determine criminal matters of the kind purportedly instituted by Mr Vescio.
 The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the criminal prosecutions initiated by him: cf Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 (Cth), s 4(2) (confined to civil matters); Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999) 198 CLR 511 (holding s 4(2) to be unconstitutional). 8 In these circumstances, the appropriate order is that the proceedings be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
