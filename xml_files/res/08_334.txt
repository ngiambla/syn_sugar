 He gave two reasons for his non-attendance: that his agent did not advise him to go and that his agent did not tell him the time or the date of the hearing.
 Accordingly it was open to the Magistrate not to take the appellant's concessions at face value. 16 In his closing submissions the appellant's counsel accepted that there were inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence.
 He submitted that it was nevertheless open to the Magistrate to find that: the appellant was unaware of the time and place of the tribunal hearing as a result of the fraudulent conduct of his migration agent; the agent had forged the appellant's signature on various forms; and the agent knowingly included false information on a number forms.
 The High Court made clear that, even in circumstances where the tribunal acts blamelessly, it may nevertheless fall into jurisdictional error if its decision is affected by the fraud of a third party such as an applicant's migration agent.
