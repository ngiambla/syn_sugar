 The second and third respondents are said to be persons jointly responsible for the management and day to day operations of the first respondent. 3 The applicant is the registered owner of trade marks which include the brand names 'Hello Kitty' and 'Sanrio'.
 The Statement of Claim pleads that since about 1980 the applicant has conducted business in Australia by promoting, distributing, offering for sale and selling through its authorised re-sellers in Australia a wide range of clothing and consumer goods under the brand name 'Hello Kitty'.
 Mr Beven deposes, however, that up to the date upon which his affidavit was sworn: 'No evidence has been received that the goods in question are genuine products with legitimately applied trade marks or signed undertakings by Impressions International. ' 6 By letter dated 6 March 2008 Lim Whalen and Co were informed that unless the undertakings sought in the letter of 13 February 2008 were provided by 7 March 2008, legal proceedings would be commenced.
 Nevertheless, affidavit evidence was provided in an affidavit sworn by John Dominic Lee filed in Court today that he had a conversation with Mr Lim of Lim Whalen and Co, wherein Mr Lim accepted that the Application, Statement of Claim and earlier affidavits had been received by that firm.
