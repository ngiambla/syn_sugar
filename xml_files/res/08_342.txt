 1 The applicants, MDU Australia Insurance Company Pty Limited ( MDU ), and Avant Insurance Limited ( Avant ), have applied to the Court pursuant to Div 3A of Part III of the Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) ( the Act ) for confirmation by the Court of a scheme for the transfer of the insurance business of MDU to Avant.
 Since it is proposed to amalgamate the business of MDU and Avant, there is at least theoretically a possibility that the policyholders of Avant would be affected by the transfer because there would be further claims possibly open to be made on the assets of Avant, albeit assets that would be swollen by the amalgamation of the assets of MDU. 8 Mr Adrian Gould, a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries (London), has prepared a report on the proposed transfer.
