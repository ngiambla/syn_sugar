 Nonetheless, were liability in respect of a GST assessment joint, there would, with respect, be much to commend in the adoption of a similar approach to that adopted in Sutherland v Gustar to the construction of the right to appeal to this Court against an objection decision conferred by s 14ZZ of the TAA on a "person dissatisfied" and in related practice and procedure.
 The "person dissatisfied" with the Commissioner's objection decision in respect of a GST assessment might well, for just the reasons identified by the Court of Appeal in Sutherland v Gustar , be but one of a number of partners. 42 Yet a partner's liability in respect of GST and any related administrative penalty is not just joint, but rather joint and several.
 Within Schedule 1 to the TAA, s. 444-30 provides, materially: " 444-30 Partnerships (1) Obligations that are imposed under this Schedule or an indirect tax law on a partnership are imposed on each partner, but may be discharged by any of the partners. (2) The partners are jointly and severally liable to pay any amount that is payable under this Schedule or an indirect tax law by the partnership. " 43 Prior to the introduction of this provision into Schedule 1 the now repealed provisions formerly found in ss 50(1) and 50(2) of the TAA made identical provision in respect of the GST liability of partners.
