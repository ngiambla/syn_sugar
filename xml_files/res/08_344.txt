 FChem's breaches of the Act 10 FChem arrived at an understanding in or about June 1998 with Koppers as a result of the conduct of Mr Greenacre, its Group General Manager, relating to the increase its prices in respect of the CCA.
 Further, Osmose gave effect to the ATP price control provision by supplying CCA to ATP at a price of $2,700 per active tonne between 23 February 2001 and December 2001, thereby contravening s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Act. 13 Osmose, by Mr Greenacre, engaged in a meeting with the Managing Director of Koppers in late February 2001.
 Mr Greenacre's breaches of the Act 14 Mr Greenacre breached s 76(1)(e) of the Act by being directly knowingly concerned in FChem giving effect to a provision contained in an agreement made in June 1998 (as detailed above) that FChem would follow general price increases by Koppers.
