 It appears that the applicant would require an extension of time to file the application for an order of review in this Court, being outside the 28 day time limit: see s 11(3) of the ADJR Act .
 Submissions were received from the applicant and the respondents. 34 The applicant's submissions, made both orally at the hearing and in written form afterwards, primarily concern the propriety and legality of the Federal Magistrate's orders of 3 August 2007.
 The pleadings filed by the applicant refer in a general sense to damage to his character and reputation and to "defamation", as well as more specifically in relation to the contents of the reports and statements made by the respondents' solicitor in Court.
 The respondents also submit that there is no suggestion in the material filed by the applicant that the actions complained of occurred outside any officer's course of duty, and that the actions should therefore be dealt with in accordance with the authorities cited.
