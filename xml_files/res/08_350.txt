 The hearing of the matter commenced on Monday, 26 November 2007 and continued through to and including Friday, 30 November 2007 whereupon it was stood over, part heard, to Tuesday, 4 March 2008 at 10.15 am in the anticipation that the hearing would conclude on or before Thursday, 6 March 2008.
 The Court further ordered that the applicant pay the costs of the first, second and third respondents of the application made ore tenus at 2.15 pm on 4 March 2008. 4 At the commencement of the hearing today, 5 March 2008, Mr Orlov alone appeared for the applicant.
 Section 25(2)(a) of the Federal Court Act provides: '25(2) Applications: (a) for leave ... to appeal to the Court; ... may be heard and determined by a single Judge or by a Full Court. ' 7 Order 52, rule 10 of the Federal Court Rules deals with applications for leave to appeal from interlocutory judgments of the Court.
 I do not consider that questions of protective costs orders such as have been mooted are germane to the question of whether or not leave to appeal should be granted. 17 Mr Orlov is obviously in the delicate position of suggesting to the trial Judge that what he did yesterday was wrong.
