 The respondent says that he did so because he did not have the assistance of the promoters of the Infomercial Schemes including Mr Peter Leslie Ambrosy and that without his assistance it was not possible for him to present his case in the AAT.
 The November 2000 assessments for 1995 and 1996 have never been the subject of an application for review or legal challenge. 10 On 15 June 2005 a summary judgment was entered in the Supreme Court proceedings against the respondent for the sum of $38,084,522.24 including interest.
 The respondent has sought special leave to appeal to the High Court from the decision of the Full Court. 33 The relevant inquiry should proceed on the footing that an application for special leave to the High Court is different in character from the situation where an appeal lies as of right: Westpac Banking Corporation v Carver [2003] FCA 221 ; (2003) 126 FCR 113 at [12] .
 Counsel for the respondent informed me that the interest figure in question was the $9,375. 62 The applicant submits that the AAT has no jurisdiction to hear the underlying substantive application because, in relation to the interest amount of $9375 there has been no reviewable objection decision: s 14ZZA of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 . 63 It is unnecessary to decide that question.
