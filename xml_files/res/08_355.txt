 1 This is an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal against a decision of a Federal Magistrate (Scarlett FM) made on 17 September 2007 ( SZHFX Ors v Minister for Immigration Anor [2007] FMCA 1575).
 The s 424A letter of 24 May 2005 to the applicants' solicitors was relevantly in these terms: The Tribunal has information that would, subject to any comments you make, be the reason, or part of the reason, for deciding that you are not entitled to a protection visa.
 The first applicant argues that the failure to disclose the content of the independent reports on the behaviour of Kala Jahangir and the detail and the extensive searches relating to Kala Jahangir motives and allegiances was not disclosed in accordance with s 424A thus amounting to jurisdictional error.
