 He found no jurisdictional error was established. 11 His Honour found the Tribunal was entitled to have regard to country information it considered relevant, that the use and weight of it was for the Tribunal to determine and that this use was excepted by s 424A(3)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). 12 The Federal Magistrate also found the Tribunal properly understood the claims and found there was no well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
 It is clear that an allegation of bias must be distinctly made and proven: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [69] per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J.
 It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal: SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J.
