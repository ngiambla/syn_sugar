 The Federal Magistrate erred in finding the evidence (as to the death of the priest) occurred after the Tribunal hearing. 15 Although the first ground of appeal is directed against the Tribunal rather than the Federal Magistrates Court, for the purposes of this appeal, the grounds will be considered as alleging a failure on the part of the Court below to identify those failures of the Tribunal.
 It would be a rare and extreme circumstance that bias on the part of the Tribunal would be established simply by reference to the reasons produced by the Tribunal: SCAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 668 at [38] per von Doussa J.
 However, the Tribunal, although it did attempt to contact one of the priests of the appellant's church and was unsuccessful in doing so, had no obligation to inquire in that sense: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; (2004) 207 ALR 12 at [1] per Gleeson CJ and [43] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.
