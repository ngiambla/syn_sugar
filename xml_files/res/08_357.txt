 On 5 December 2005, the Tribunal sent Mr Bunnag an invitation under s 359(2) of the Act to provide further information relating to a variety of matters including details of the sponsor's medical condition, details of her hospitalisation and the nature and extent of any support provided by him to her.
 This information was therefore capable of going to the veracity of Mr Bunnag's claims in relation to the nature of the marriage during the relevant period of time and therefore by inference, also at the time that the decision was to be made.
 As to the question of whether the relationship was genuine and continuing, the Tribunal concluded that while Mr Bunnag may care for the sponsor and support her while she was unwell at most, that care occurred on an intermittent basis only as Mr Bunnag was unaware of the day to day whereabouts of the sponsor.
