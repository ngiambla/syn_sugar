 It is said that in order to be valid, the opinion must address satisfaction of the criteria in par 4007(1)(c) as at the date of the Minister's decision , and that the MOC's report relied on by the Tribunal in this case could not satisfy this requirement.
 In particular, par 4007(1)(c) of Schedule 4 of the Regulations establishes as a criterion for grant of a visa that the provision of health care or community services relating to an applicant's disease or medical condition would not be likely to result in a significant cost to the Australian community, regardless of whether such care will actually be used.
 In particular, it is not apparent that the Tribunal, when forming its conclusions at [59] on the issue of waiver under par 4007(2), took into account Dr Chen's opinions as matters to be considered and weighed against all the other circumstances when determining what is an "undue cost".
