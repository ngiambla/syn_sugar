 There was no evidence that the appellant attended, at the nominated time and place for the hearing on 9 February 2006, or that he decided not to do so in consequence of any communication from the tribunal to him that it had already made a decision prior to that date.
 This is because s 426A was, the appellant argued, the tribunal's only source of power to make a decision once the appellant had been invited to a hearing under s 425. 12 The appellant argued that the proper construction of the Act raised issues of importance beyond the facts of his own case.
 Such a consent, if given after the applicant for review has been informed that the tribunal did not consider that it should decide the review in the applicant's favour on the material before it and thus wished to invite him or her to a hearing so as to persuade it to the contrary, would be an informed consent to a decision being made against the interests of the applicant.
