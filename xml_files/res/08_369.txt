 Allphones argued that, nonetheless, it contains statements or representations made by Mr Lloyd in the course of giving evidence in these 'proceedings' in a more general sense. 25 The Evidence Act does not, itself, define the expression 'proceeding', although it does provide definitions for 'Australian or overseas proceeding', 'civil proceeding', 'criminal proceeding'.
 Indeed, s 4 provides that the Act is to apply in relation to 'all proceedings in a federal Court or an ACT Court', including, among others, proceedings relating to bail, interlocutory proceedings or proceedings of a similar kind, proceedings heard in chambers or, in some exceptions, sentencing proceedings.
 The question is whether the representations in pars 7 and 8 are capable of showing that before giving its notice of intention to terminate, Allphones had knowledge of the failure of Hoy Mobile to account for receipts from sales of the unlocked phones.
