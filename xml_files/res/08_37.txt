 On 26 June 2002 Holdings applied under Div 25 and Div 48 of the GST Act to the Commissioner to do the following: (a) revoke the approval of Holdings as one of the members of the McDonald's Australia GST Group; (b) approve the applicant to replace Holdings as the representative member of the McDonald's Australia GST Group; and (c) cancel its GST registration. 3 On or about 19 August 2002 the Commissioner accepted and processed the applications with an effective date of 1 July 2002.
 The appeal against that disallowance is matter No NSD 1442 of 2007. 6 On 8 January 2007 the Commissioner made a declaration under s 165-40 of the GST Act purporting to negate a GST benefit obtained by the applicant in the December 2002 BAS in the amount of $8,990,014.
 The net amount expressed to be owing was the same as that owing under the first assessment but it was clear that the Commissioner was asserting reliance upon the declaration as well as the original rejection of the input tax credit.
 It is submitted that the hypothesis must be reasonable and based upon the evidence ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 385; Epov v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 34 ; (2007) 65 ATR 399 at 412).
