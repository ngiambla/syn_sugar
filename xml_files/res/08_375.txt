 As to the al fresco feature Mr Doulgeridis was asked: And you will have observed the al fresco feature and the surrounding rooms from the Seattle and Memphis, didn't you? ---I knew that a key feature of the home was the al fresco itself.
 HIS HONOUR: Which plans are you talking about now? ---The Aberdeen plan, the Rochester plan and the Carlisle plan, being the Provence. 56 In examination-in-chief Mr Taylor said that there had been comment about their previous employer Henley.
 Do you recall with any precision, what that comment was? ---That in the development of the plan, John had used concepts and, for (want) of another better word, inspiration, in the development of the Provence plan.
 Again he thought the al fresco and surrounding living areas including the indoor/outdoor connection and the al fresco space itself was a "highly significant" feature of both houses. 102 In comparing the Aberdeen plan to the Provence plan Dr Cooke considered the Aberdeen plan a close version of the Memphis plan, mirror reversed.
