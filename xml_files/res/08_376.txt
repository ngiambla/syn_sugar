 Notwithstanding the attempt by Senior Counsel for Eden to suggest otherwise, the fact is that the relevant parts of Eden's amended points of claim alleged only that DPWS made representations to Allied and that as a result Allied did not engage Eden as its subcontractor on the Moruya Heads Project.
 However, in its post-hearing written submissions, Eden has not attempted to identify that obligation. 30 The evidence showed that Allied had heard bad things about Eden from the DPWS, and that Allied itself had become concerned over the attitude of Eden's managing director, and so had ceased to be of a mind to accept Eden's tender.
