 The material in the fourth affidavit seeks to contradict earlier evidence and advance a new case for the respondent, including in para 9 of the fourth affidavit with respect to which entity used and intended to use the relevant trademark.
 Findings 11 In my view the fourth and fifth affidavits are not admissible. 12 First, to the extent to which this evidence purports to rebut a written submission of Mr Franklin and any alleged inaccuracies in that submission, it seems to me the most obvious method of rebuttal is in the form of closing submissions from Mr Stephens.
 Section 135 Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provides the court with a general discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be, inter alia , unfairly prejudicial to a party.
