 1 On 22 January 2008 I made orders in these proceedings extending from 31 January 2008 current orders under s 1323 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) against the first, second, fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth and twelfth defendants to midnight on 6 March 2008.
 More time is required for completion of the investigations and both Mr Carey and Mr Rundle are significant persons of interest. 13 Although the written submissions refer to a 'necessity' for travel restraints, senior counsel for ASIC properly accepted that their case was based upon their desirability.
 I place little weight on that matter. 11.3 [His] failure to disclose significant overseas assets and his unsatisfactory evidence given during his examinations. 11.4 The receiver's conclusion that, as to Mr Carey, although identifying assets or potential assets not disclosed by him, the receiver is not in a position to determine whether he has identified all of Mr Carey's assets.
 He had been generally cooperative with the receiver and ASIC expected that he would comply with the freezing orders then proposed. 16 ASIC drew something of a distinction between Mr Carey and Mr Rundle in its submissions on the basis that Mr Carey remains a key subject of its investigations.
