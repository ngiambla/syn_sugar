 The respondent is entitled to costs (see Order 22 rule 3(1) of the Federal Court Rules ) but in the absence of agreement to the amount of costs must establish the amount of costs to be awarded in the ordinary way.
 On 14 March 2008 an affidavit was sworn and filed by Ms Kantaria, who represented the Minister, in support of an application for costs in the sum of $4,255.
 However, it is not necessary for me to attempt to deal with the matter at a more general level than the present case. 5 In the present case submissions were filed on behalf of the Minister on 13 March 2008.
