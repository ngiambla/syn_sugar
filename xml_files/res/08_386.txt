 The contempt power and the punishment options 4 Section 219(7) of the ASIC Act confers power on the Court to punish, as on contempt, a person who fails to attend before the Board, or who fails to answer a question when required to do so by the Chairman. 5 As a statutory analogue for the exercise of the power to punish for contempt, no question arises under s 219(7) as to the Court's power of punishment.
 The statutory sources of the power are s 31 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 24 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and rule 11.04 of the High Court Rules. 7 The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is no longer of any practical significance: Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534.
