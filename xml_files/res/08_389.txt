 I conclude that the reference to "the orders made on 15 October 2007" is to be understood as, or including, a reference to the operative order of the District Court made on that day requiring Citigroup to pay Mr Mason the amount found to be owing to him in respect of annual leave entitlements and interest.
 As a consequence I conclude that it is not necessary to obtain leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of a court of a State or Territory in a matter arising under the WR Act --- notwithstanding that it is necessary to obtain leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the Court in a comparable matter.
 As the notice of appeal was filed within 21 days of 15 October 2007, I reject the contention that the appeal purportedly instituted thereby is incompetent. 36 Neither party addressed the Court on whether Judge Toner pronounced a costs order on 25 September 2007, or alternatively on 15 October 2007, or whether his Honour is still waiting to hear from the parties on the question of costs.
 CONCLUSION 37 I conclude that, subject to the unresolved issue of any costs order made by the District Court, the notice of appeal filed by Citigroup instituted an appeal from the judgment pronounced by the District Court on 15 October 2007 and that Citigroup requires neither leave to appeal nor an extension of time within which to file and serve its notice of appeal.
