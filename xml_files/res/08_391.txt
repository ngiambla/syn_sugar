 The first to third respondents ("the Amcor parties") do not object to the orders sought, nor does Cadbury Schweppes Pty Limited, which is not a party to this proceeding. 3 The ACCC's position (and the reason it claims its interests are affected by the orders sought) is that to allow disclosure of proofs of evidence and other materials served on the Visy parties in the ACCC proceeding is premature because the implied undertaking which applies to those proofs of evidence are presently the subject of a reserved decision by Gordon J in the Cadbury proceeding.
 While I agree that a release from the implied undertaking should not be granted until the issue of prejudice has been canvassed, in my view, all other documents which will not either appear on the list prepared by the Visy parties or be the subject of claims for privilege or confidentiality, should be disclosed immediately so that the matter may progress. 22 An opportunity might be given, if appropriate and necessary, to non-parties who may be affected to submit to the Court what prejudice, if any, might arise if a release from the implied undertaking is granted.
 In this way, the discovery process can move forward. 23 Accordingly, I do not consider that, at this stage, there should be an unqualified release of the implied undertaking which affects the Visy parties until the list of the documents which may give rise to any prejudice to non-parties has been compiled and consideration given to whether any such claims for prejudice can be substantiated.
 Otherwise, the documents other than those of the ACCC, those contained in the list to be prepared by the Visy parties and those which are the subject of claims for privilege or confidentiality should be immediately disclosed. 24 In my view, for the above reasons this application, insofar as it seeks release from the implied undertaking, should be stood over pending determination of issues relating to privilege and confidentiality. 25 Insofar as this application is concerned, I reserve the question of costs.
