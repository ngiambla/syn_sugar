 The actual expenditure on food and household provisions was $598.20 and on gym and trainer was $173.08. 9 Mr Carey argued in his affidavit that if he were to make up all of the actual expense incurred on a weekly basis as at April 2007, which totalled $4,683.09, together with the increases that have occurred since then, he would need to expend $5,062.
 He said he has found it increasingly difficult to live within the $4,000 allowance with the widely reported increase in the cost of living. 10 Mr Carey says that if his living allowance were reduced from $4,000 per week the impact upon him and his family would be catastrophic.
 In coming to that conclusion I bear in mind that the allowance has been in place for a considerable period of time, that it was negotiated with the receivers and that there is only a short period of time remaining for the operation of the restrictions.
