 In that decision the Tribunal concluded that as from 3 December 2001 Ms Davies had been partially incapacitated for work as a result of an injury she had suffered and was entitled to compensation in respect to that injury. 2 Comcare seeks to appeal from that decision.
 This difficulty is the simple fact that it did not raise for resolution before the Tribunal any contention that there was " suitable employment " other than the venture undertaken by her, namely the Bali Gardens venture. 18 It is not considered that any such contention was raised, or at least adequately raised, in Comcare's Statement of Facts and Contentions .
 The Tribunal's reasons at paragraph [68] draw a clear distinction between the financial evidence to which it was referring ending on 30 June 2004 and an express recognition that there was no " available evidence " upon which a finding could be made " for the remainder of the period under consideration ".
