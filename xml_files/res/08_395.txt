 A matter relevant to the second aspect is whether the interlocutory decision under challenge is one that 'has the practical effect of finally determining the rights of the parties' (see Ex parte Bucknell [1936] HCA 67 ; (1936) 56 CLR 221 at 225; see also Yap v Granich and Associates [2001] FCA 1735 at [6] ). 6 Before the primary judge, McDonald's relied, for its contention that a defence to its applications was bound to fail, upon the contents of appeal statements filed by the respondent Commissioner pursuant to O 52B r 5 of the Federal Court Rules .
 The amended appeal statements which were before the primary judge were, in each case, prefaced by the following: ' Preamble The Commissioner was not a party to any of the transactions relevant to this application and his knowledge of the facts is primarily derived from documents and information supplied by the Applicant, the Applicant's representatives and other parties involved in the transactions.
 As his Honour said, it was a novel and ambitious application to suggest that the proceedings commenced by McDonald's were irresistible and that any defence was bound to be rejected as not reasonably arguable, particularly at a stage when evidence had not been filed and there had been no discovery. 13 In an affidavit filed in each proceeding by Gina Lazanas, a partner in the firm of solicitors acting for McDonald's, it is asserted that if leave to appeal is not granted McDonalds will have to prepare its evidence which will involve reviewing and considering approximately 18 boxes of documents and drafting affidavits of approximately seven witnesses.
