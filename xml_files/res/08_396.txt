 In the course of conducting an inspection of the premises, as a result of ultimately obtaining access around 9am Australian Eastern Time, information became apparent that there was material on the premises, in the form of an envelope bearing an address, "Care of Synergy, 3 The Causeway, Melbourne".
 I am informed by Mr Brown that the officer described as Peter Young, is the brother of the first respondent, Michael Young. 5 The affidavit material also deposes to information concerning a conversation with Mr Luke Fox, the applicant's general counsel.
 Having regard to the material deposed to in the affidavit of Mr Brown, I am satisfied that, consistent with order 25B of the Federal Court rules, and the practice direction, that there is a serious prospect that evidence will not be preserved in the absence of an order being made. 6 I am satisfied as to all of the elements of order 25B of the rules and I propose to make a further search order. 7 The order will be that a Search Order issue in the form of the Search Order annexed to the draft order.
