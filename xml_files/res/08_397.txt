 1 This is an appeal on a question of law from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal). 2 Each of the respondent taxpayers claimed income tax deductions for the year ending 30 June 1997 for expenses that each had incurred as a licensee of Oracle Information and Communications Pty Ltd, arising from his participation in the Oracle International Project. 3 The applicant (the Commissioner) made determinations under s 177F(1) of Pt IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the Act) that each respondent had obtained, in connection with a scheme, a tax benefit within the meaning of s 177C(1) and s 177D.
 The imposition of additional tax by way of penalty in respect of the "tax avoidance scheme" referred to in s 224(2) and s 226L involves different considerations as to the taxpayer's intention, to the imposition of penalty tax under s 226 in relation to Pt IVA determinations (see Commissioner of Taxation v Starr [2007] FCAFC 204). 16 Accordingly, the Tribunal made an error of law in the construction of the Act.
