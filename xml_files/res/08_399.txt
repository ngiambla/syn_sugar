 In deciding whether or not to approve the taking of the proposed action, I took into account, among other matters, the principles of ecologically sustainable development, as required under Section 136(2)(a) of the EPBC Act, and the precautionary principle, as required under Section 391 of the EPBC Act. 61.
 In particular, I considered that my proposed decision would be consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development because of the strict conditions I was contemplating imposing to ensure the adequate protection of the relevant matters of national environmental significance.
 Matthew Johnston and I also discussed whether or not the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism (the RET Minister ) should be informed of any proposed decision and invited to make comments pursuant to s 131 of the Act.
