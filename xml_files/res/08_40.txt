 His Honour referred to the more recent history of the proceedings to that date observing: 2 The circumstances in which decision on the motion has been delayed have been set out in Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com.limited [2007] FCA 262 and in reasons published on 15 April 2005 - Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com Limited [2005] FCA 438.
 RELEVANT LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS 10 There is of course no doubt about the power under s 56 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant (or a respondent) to give security for costs and also a power to increase the amount of any security ordered to be given.
 Again I observe that the appropriate period for comparison is 2003 rather than 2000 but that said, one can readily accept that this factor would have a bearing on the cost of defending the proceedings. 21 Fourthly, the allocation of time for the trial has now increased from four days to five days.
 In the context of the amount claimed by Adultshop, this seems to me to be of little significance given also that the proceedings against Melbourne Information have fallen away by settlement. 22 Fifthly, it is asserted that the number of substantive legal issues in the proceedings has increased with the amended substituted statement of claim.
