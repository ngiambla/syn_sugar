 His Honour referred to the more recent history of the proceedings to that date observing: 2 The circumstances in which decision on the motion has been delayed have been set out in Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com.limited [2007] FCA 262 and in reasons published on 15 April 2005 - Capital Webworks Pty Ltd v Adultshop.com Limited [2005] FCA 438.
 In addition I referred in Capital Webworks [2005] FCA 438 at [45] - [47] to reliance by the first and second respondents on FCR O 35A r 2(1)(f) and r 3 to support the stay or dismissal on the basis of failure to prosecute the proceeding with due diligence. 3 The first contention made by the first and second respondents in support of the motion for stay or dismissal was that the application was an abuse of process because it was unlawfully maintained and champertous, and so an abuse of process.
 Again I observe that the appropriate period for comparison is 2003 rather than 2000 but that said, one can readily accept that this factor would have a bearing on the cost of defending the proceedings. 21 Fourthly, the allocation of time for the trial has now increased from four days to five days.
