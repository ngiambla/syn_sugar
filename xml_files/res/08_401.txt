 THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING AND THE COMMISSION'S SUBMISSIONS (A) Mr Newson's right hip 23 The Tribunal found that clinical onset of osteoarthrosis in Mr Newson's right hip occurred '.... before 1991, but not as early as 1981: probably the mid 1980s ' at [50] and [51]. 24 The Tribunal first considered Mr Newson's right hip claim against the current Statement of Principles (Instrument No 32 of 2005).
 We therefore find that Mr Newson meets factor (5)(j) in Instrument No.82 of 2001. 28 On its appeal to this Court, the Commission submitted that cl 4 of the Statement of Principles required, relevantly, that factor 5(j) ' be related to any relevant service rendered by the person . ' Mr Newson's period of eligible service commenced on 3 November 1942 and ended on 6 January 1947.
 I would read that requirement as requiring two contiguous years. 35 As a matter of construction, the periods referred to in the factors in cll 5(j) ('within any 10 year period') and (k) ('for at least two years') must encompass at least part of a period of relevant service for the requirement of cl 4 of Instrument No 82 of 2001 to be met; otherwise there is no relationship between the injury/disease and the relevant service.
 As indicated in [35] above, this in turn requires the relevant periods therein referred to -'within any 10 year period' and 'for at least two years' --- to encompass at least part of a period of relevant service so as to provide a relationship to meet the requirements of cl 4 that the factor must be related to any relevant service rendered by the person.
