 From about September 2005 to September 2006, Hobie entered into written agreements with both dealers in sail boats and dealers in kayaks which contained, inter alia, express terms to the same effect as those referred to above in relation to the Glascraft dealership.
 That responsibility derives ultimately from s 71 of the Constitution and cannot be circumscribed by private agreement: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [18] .
 CONSIDERATION The Declarations Sought It is unnecessary for me to rehearse the principles governing the award of declaratory relief particularly in cases of public interest such as the present; see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Midland Brick Co Pty Ltd (2004) 207 ALR 329.
