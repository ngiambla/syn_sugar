 The five categories are identified below. 9 The Patrick Respondents have filed a motion seeking orders striking out the Application and Statement of Claim pursuant to FCR , O 11 r 16. 11 The PO Respondents seek to strike out the whole of the Statement of Claim or, alternatively, paragraphs 280-289 and 302-308.
 As has been seen, the Statement of Claim alleges, inter alia , that it was a provision of the arrangement that the parties create AAT as a joint venture company to manage their existing superior automotive terminals and to establish shared motor vehicle and general cargo terminals throughout Australia (para 165.1).
 In particular, the Statement of Claim does not plead the nature of the competitive market that would have existed but for the impugned provisions of the arrangement. 39 Mr Burnside explained the ACCC's case in relation to the alleged arrangement for the Patrick Respondents and the PO Corporations to bid jointly for the Glebe Island lease.
