 I had advised the parties on 10 March 2008 at the final hearing of those two motions that the hearing of the petition would be proceeding today. 2 Nonetheless, today, Mr Dundo appearing for the respondent maintained an application for an adjournment on the following grounds.
 The affidavit of Mr Poliwka annexes, amongst other things, copies of the applications for extensions of time for lodging applications for review of decisions with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") as well as pleadings filed with the AAT by both the applicant and respondent. 6 It also annexes the respondent's summary of argument in respect of its application for special leave to the High Court of Australia as well as the applicant's summary of argument in response.
 The results of the pending AAT applications are irrelevant because separately and together their success would still leave, as I have already found, an amount in excess of $4 million which is unconnected with the AAT proceedings which form part of the bankruptcy notice underpinning the petition.
 It is in terms merely that the solicitors for the respondent would appreciate the opportunity to have a conference, for about one hour, with him and Mr Cummins. 14 More than a week later, on or about 7 March 2008, Mr Dundo deposes that he was informed that Dr Schoombee had returned to his chambers.
