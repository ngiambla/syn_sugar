 The NAB therefore became entitled to commence enforcement action against the company. 10 However, the NAB has indicated it is prepared to stay enforcement action and to allow the company to continue operating the overdraft facility, in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in its letter of offer.
 The effect of this is that subject to the Court making an order terminating the winding-up and subject also to the NAB receiving notification of the Court's orders by 4 April 2008 and no fresh event of default occurring in the meantime, the overdraft facility will be reinstated, in accordance with the terms on which it was granted. 11 The only other issue which arises is the question of the possibility of subrogation of the debts arising from payments made by Stead Properties and JRJ to which I referred above.
 I also have evidence from the other director of JRJ, Ms Janette Khalil, who is Mr Khalil's mother, stating that she also agrees to JRJ waiving the inter-company indebtedness. 13 Mr Golledge who appeared for the company on the instructions of the liquidator, raised with me the status of the evidence on this question because it does not rise above a statement of intention to forgive or waive the debts.
