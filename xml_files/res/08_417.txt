 THE ORDER FOR COSTS MADE BY THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 6 On 30 November 2007 the orders made by the Federal Magistrate were that the application then before that Court should be dismissed and that Ms Lawrance was to pay the costs of those proceedings either as agreed or taxed.
 An order, however, is not made " simply for the asking ": Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1996] HCA 3 ; (1995) 134 ALR 460 at 463 per Kirby J. 12 In concluding that an order should not be made as sought by Ms Lawrance, reliance has been placed upon a number of considerations.
 That paragraph provides as follows: [70] Ms Lawrance has not established that any person unlawfully discriminated against her under s 24 of the Disability Discrimination Act on the ground of a disability, or an imputed disability, in the provision of goods, services or facilities at the Federal Court.
