 Again, there was no issue of indemnity, or solicitor/client, costs in Cutts v Head . 6 What follows from a consideration of Calderbank and of Cutts v Head themselves is that, necessarily, those cases articulated no proposition which linked a party's entitlement to indemnity costs with a settlement offer previously made by that party, and rejected by the other party.
 An example of a case in which it was held that the offer of settlement had been reasonable, and should have been accepted, but that the rejection was not thereby to be regarded as unreasonable, was Alpine Hardwoods (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (2002) 190 ALR 121.
