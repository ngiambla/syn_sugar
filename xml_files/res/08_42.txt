 Again, there was no issue of indemnity, or solicitor/client, costs in Cutts v Head . 6 What follows from a consideration of Calderbank and of Cutts v Head themselves is that, necessarily, those cases articulated no proposition which linked a party's entitlement to indemnity costs with a settlement offer previously made by that party, and rejected by the other party.
 In the latter case, having quoted from the judgment of Woodward J, Gray J (with the assent of the other members of the Full Court) said (188 ALR at 665 [20]): Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail.
 An example of a case in which it was held that the offer of settlement had been reasonable, and should have been accepted, but that the rejection was not thereby to be regarded as unreasonable, was Alpine Hardwoods (Aust) Pty Ltd v Hardys Pty Ltd (2002) 190 ALR 121.
