 The evidence about that payment is adduced not to demonstrate that Capital was able to find those funds but rather to clarify that the payment was made at a time before any order was made by this Court for security for costs to be paid (that order being foreshadowed in reasons on 30 January 2008).
 Adultshop could be expected to seek dismissal, especially given the history of these proceedings and the fact that they were stayed in any event as a result of the non-payment of the security on both this occasion and previously.
 I do consider that the state of readiness for trial on the part of Capital and its financial commitment to its own solicitor/client costs as well as the earlier payments for security for costs are factors which do give rise to an inference that it is more likely than not that Capital will make an earnest effort to meet the security for costs order so that the trial which had been imminent can proceed.
