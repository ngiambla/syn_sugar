 1 On 16 March 2005 a delegate of the Commonwealth Attorney-General set in train a series of events which, it was hoped, would enable certain Commonwealth authorities to obtain access to documents which were believed to be located in Switzerland.
 On that day the delegate made a request to Switzerland under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) ("the Mutual Assistance Act") and the Treaty between Australia and Switzerland on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters done at Berne in Switzerland on 25 November 1991 ("the Treaty").
 The request sought the assistance of Swiss authorities in obtaining business records from Strachans SA, an accountancy services firm based in Geneva, and from Corner Banca SA, which is a private banking institution based in Lugano.
 The request signed by the Attorney-General's delegate on 16 March 2005 is specifically said to have been made by the delegate. 23 The various documents sent from Australia to the Swiss authorities in the wake of the request did not form part of the request.
