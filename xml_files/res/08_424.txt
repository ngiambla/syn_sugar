 On that day the delegate made a request to Switzerland under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) ("the Mutual Assistance Act") and the Treaty between Australia and Switzerland on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters done at Berne in Switzerland on 25 November 1991 ("the Treaty").
 The request sought the assistance of Swiss authorities in obtaining business records from Strachans SA, an accountancy services firm based in Geneva, and from Corner Banca SA, which is a private banking institution based in Lugano.
 The request advised the Swiss authorities that the records were required for "the investigation into, and possible prosecution of" certain named individuals, including the first applicant ("Mr Dunn") in this proceeding, whom, it was said was suspected of tax fraud and conspiracy offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.
