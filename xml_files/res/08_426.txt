 Upon receiving the parcel of absentee ballot-papers, the Divisional Returning Officer was required to review the declarations on the unopened envelopes and accept the absentee ballot-papers for further scrutiny if the electors were entitled to vote in the officer's division or otherwise reject the absentee ballot-papers (see Reg 59(1), 1919 Regulations ).
 It thus became possible to determine how a particular elector had voted. 14 An elector who wished to vote by post was required to apply for a postal vote certificate and a postal ballot-paper (see Reg 40(1), 1919 Regulations ).
