 Upon receiving the parcel of absentee ballot-papers, the Divisional Returning Officer was required to review the declarations on the unopened envelopes and accept the absentee ballot-papers for further scrutiny if the electors were entitled to vote in the officer's division or otherwise reject the absentee ballot-papers (see Reg 59(1), 1919 Regulations ).
 It thus became possible to determine how a particular elector had voted. 14 An elector who wished to vote by post was required to apply for a postal vote certificate and a postal ballot-paper (see Reg 40(1), 1919 Regulations ).
 The petitioner's subpoena required the production to the Court of "the parcels of ballot papers containing thirty five ballot papers reserved for the decision of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State of Victoria and the ballot papers examined, counted and dealt with by [the Returning Officer] under section 135 subsection 3 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-1919 . " The respondent's subpoena required the production of the official roll of electors for the division and all documents relating to postal and absentee voting by certain named electors. 37 The ballot-papers were produced to the Court by the Electoral Officer.
