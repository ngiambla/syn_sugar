 The bankruptcy notice demanded payment of the amount of the judgment and interest. 11 As noted earlier, on 26 April 2005 Mr Snelgrove presented the creditor's petition against Mr Roskell in the Federal Magistrates Court. 12 On 28 July 2005, Mr Roskell filed a notice of intention to oppose the petition.
 If the date lay outside the period, it would be clear from the terms of the orders alone that his Honour must have intended that the petition remain on foot beyond the expiration of that period. 18 On 6 June 2006, Driver FM delivered judgment (see Snelgrove v Roskell [2006] FMCA 503).
 On 15 February 2007, Jacobson J allowed the appeal, set aside his Honour's orders and remitted the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court to be determined in accordance with Jacobson J's reasons for judgment (see Snelgrove v Roskell [2007] FCA 122). 21 Jacobson J held that upon the proper construction of the bankruptcy notice, the claim for interest was only for post-judgment interest.
 Mr Roskell argued, for example, that he was not personally liable for the costs, or, at the very least, that that the amount was overstated. 23 Mr Roskell also submitted before Jacobson J that "a copy of the record of judgement [sic]" was not attached to the bankruptcy notice.
 He considered that in these circumstances it was appropriate for him to remit the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court, for that Court to determine whether it had power to make a sequestration order and, if so, whether such an order ought to be made. 26 In the result, Jacobson J made the orders referred to at [20] above.
 His Honour also referred to s 43 of the Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth). 31 Having concluded that O 35 r 7(3) of the FC Rules was available to him, Driver FM noted that Mr Roskell submitted that he would have resisted an extension of the life of the petition if application for it had been made before the expiration of the 12 month period.
 I gratefully acknowledge the considerable assistance Mr Ash has given to the Court. 36 The lapsing of the petition and Driver FM's reliance on the slip rule in O 35 r 7(3) of the FC Rules raised the following questions, by reference to which Mr Ash's submissions were structured: 1.
 The bankruptcy proceeding that was before his Honour was a general federal law proceeding. 41 Part 2 of Schedule 3 listed various FC Rules including "Order 35". (I note that on 27 June 2007, pursuant to the Federal Magistrates Court Amendment Rules 2007 (No. 1) (Cth), the reference to "Order 35" in Part 2 of Schedule 3 was replaced with "Order 35 (except rule 7)". ) Accordingly, at the relevant time, the provision in O 35 r 7(3) of the FC Rules applied to the proceeding that was before his Honour.
 A comprehensive statement would have added that if an application were made on 26 April 2006 for an extension and if the extension were granted, it would then be seen that the steps his orders required were to be taken within, rather than outside, the lapsing period. 53 I must, however, assess the position realistically.
 If "yes" to 1, 2, 3 and 4, was it open to Driver FM to make the particular order that he made extending the life of the petition to 25 April 2007? 59 For the reasons given in answer to question 2 above, this question should also be answered Yes.
