 The bankruptcy notice demanded payment of the amount of the judgment and interest. 11 As noted earlier, on 26 April 2005 Mr Snelgrove presented the creditor's petition against Mr Roskell in the Federal Magistrates Court. 12 On 28 July 2005, Mr Roskell filed a notice of intention to oppose the petition.
 Mr Roskell argued, for example, that he was not personally liable for the costs, or, at the very least, that that the amount was overstated. 23 Mr Roskell also submitted before Jacobson J that "a copy of the record of judgement [sic]" was not attached to the bankruptcy notice.
 He considered that in these circumstances it was appropriate for him to remit the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court, for that Court to determine whether it had power to make a sequestration order and, if so, whether such an order ought to be made. 26 In the result, Jacobson J made the orders referred to at [20] above.
 Prima facie, the petitioning creditor has a good case for applying the slip rule on the basis that if the issue had been adverted to at the time either the petition would have been extended or different procedural orders would have been made. [my emphasis] The passage emphasised by me shows that Driver FM's understanding was that the date 26 April 2006 was a date after the petition had lapsed.
