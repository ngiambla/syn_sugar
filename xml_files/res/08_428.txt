 (first court hearing) INTRODUCTION 1 The plaintiff, MBF Australia Limited (MBF), sought orders under s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) that there be convened a meeting of MBF's members for the purpose of their considering, and, if thought fit, approving a scheme of arrangement between them and MBF (Scheme).
 The other two are that PHIAC must be satisfied: (a) that the conversion scheme would not result in a financial benefit to any person who is not a policy holder of, or another person insured through, a health benefits fund conducted by the insurer; and (b) that the conversion scheme would not result in financial benefits from the Scheme being distributed inequitably between such policy holders and insured persons.
 Rule 8.1 of MBF's constitution provides, inter alia: For the avoidance of doubt and in circumstances where a company admitted to membership under rule 3.5A is entitled to vote, it has 1 vote for each individual membership held on trust by it. 33 Even if this were not so, order 10 that I made on 19 March 2008 was to the effect that at the Scheme meeting, the Trustee should be entitled to one vote for each membership held by it.
