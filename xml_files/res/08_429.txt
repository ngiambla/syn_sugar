 At least three judges of this Court have expressed doubt as to whether this Court can entertain an appeal from a decision to dismiss an application because of the non attendance of the applicant, at least in the first instance: see MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J, MZWIK v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 at [3] and VOAQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1505 at [10] per Sundberg J, and MZWFV v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 923 per North J. 4 These decisions largely rely upon a line of authority in the Full Court and, more recently, the Court of Appeal of the Victorian Supreme Court dating back to 1896: see Brown v Fraser (1896) 22 VLR 22 at 23 (holding an application to set aside a default judgment should not be made by way of appeal in the first instance), Crotty v Clarke (1896) 22 VLR 594 at 605 to 606 (holding an appeal does not lie from an order dismissing an action where one party does not appear) and Adams v Cronin Unreported Victorian Court of Appeal, 6 September 1996. 5 In the latter case, Winneke ACJ (with whom Phillips and Hayne JJ agreed) doubted whether the court could entertain an appeal from an order dismissing the appellant's claim because of her non attendance at the hearing.
 However, it seems to me that the principle stems, at least in part, from the following process of reasoning. 7 To succeed in an appeal under s 24 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) the appellant must establish that there was error on the part of the trial judge, or in this case the Federal Magistrate: see Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 170 at [20] per French, Tamberlin and Rares JJ relying upon Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47 ; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at [12] to [14] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron and Hayne JJ. 8 To establish error in a case where the decision appealed from involves a dismissal for non appearance, the appellant will, among other things, need to give an explanation for his or her non appearance (adopting the test in an application for reinstatement: see Applicant M67/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 76 per Kenny J at [13] and MZKAJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1066 at [18] per North J).
 That his explanation was sought to be put to me in this form, without elaboration or testing, underscores the problems inherent in the course the applicant has elected to take. 19 For these reasons, I conclude that the applicant's application for leave to appeal the order of Emmett FM, which dismissed his application because he failed to attend at the hearing on 27 November 2007, is misconceived and inappropriate in circumstances where he has not first made an application to set aside that decision under rule 16.05(2)(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .
