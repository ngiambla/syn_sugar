 1 These proceedings were first commenced by way of an Application and a Statement of Claim filed on 7 August 2007. 2 On 30 November 2007 orders were made dismissing the Application and Statement of Claim as against both Respondents, namely the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of New South Wales.
 No such amended application and no such amended statement of claim were then filed. 3 The matter came back before the Court on 10 March 2008 and on that occasion a further opportunity was given to the Applicants to file any proposed amended application and any proposed amended statement of claim.
 No such proposed amended application and no such proposed amended statement of claim were filed in accordance with those orders. 4 Presently before the Court are two Notices of Motion , one filed by the Commonwealth and one filed by the State of New South Wales.
 The Applicants, it is considered, have already been given an ample opportunity to file such pleadings as they wish and have failed to do so. 9 Moreover, it is considered that the proposed amended application sought to be filed today goes well beyond the issues as previously sought to be raised and seeks relief which is substantially different. 10 Substantial reservation is expressed with respect to the proposed Applicants of that draft amended application.
