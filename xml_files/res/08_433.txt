 The factors to be taken into account in the exercise of that discretion include the circumstances in which the company was de-registered, the purpose in seeking its re-registration and the likely prejudice to any person; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 at 693.
 In Donmastry Barrett J confirmed the view he had expressed in Ramantanis although, as the liquidator at the time of deregistration did not wish to continue in office and had expressly consented to another liquidator being appointed in his place, his Honour acceded to that request. 10 I respectfully agree with Barrett J as to the implication to be drawn from the fact that s 601AH(5) specifically provides for the continuity of directors of a re-registered company.
 Nevertheless, as Mr Stoljar accepted, the mere fact that a proposed liquidator's relationship with the company falls within one or more of the categories listed in s 532(c) does not preclude his or her appointment as the section itself provides that the Court has discretion in the matter.
