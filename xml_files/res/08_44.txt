 He gave evidence that Mr Schulze raised with Ms Elm the reduction in pay rates between the AWA and the Adelaide Petroleum AWA and asked: "What happens if we don't sign the AWA? " Mr Vilimas said that Ms Elm responded: "You wouldn't have a job". 21 It is not in dispute that Ms Sack and Mr Vilimas were interviewed by officers of the Office of Workplace Services on 11 October 2006 about what was said by Ms Elm at the assessment session on 9 August 2006.
 In the circumstances I am not satisfied that Bill's evidence as recorded in the record of interview is a record of his unprompted recollection of an exchange between Mr Schulze and Ms Elm. 25 Although I am not positively satisfied that Mr Schulze sought to mislead the Court, I am satisfied that his version of what was said by Ms Elm is incorrect.
 In view of the importance of the precise language used by Ms Elm and, having regard to the likelihood that their respective recollections are now tainted by their earlier discussion on the topic, I feel unable to attribute any real weight to their evidence. 27 For the above reasons I find the evidence led by the applicant on the critical issue of what was said by Ms Elm at the assessment session unsatisfactory.
