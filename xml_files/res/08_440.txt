 In response to that, the applicants answered they were presently unable to provide any further particulars to those set out in the statement of claim but may do so on discovery and on obtaining answers to interrogatories. 28 The applicants have already purported to provide some particulars of these acts of acting in concert or as mutual agents under particulars to par 6 of the statement of claim.
 The respondents contend it is clear that if there is no proper basis for par 6, it should be removed from the pleadings. 29 Following oral submissions for the respondents, the applicants provided particulars to the effect that the respondents swore certain affidavits in other proceedings in which they confirmed they had collaborated and worked closely together in producing the Sound Wave Charts.
