 The minute of this amendment was not produced until well into the applicants' argument but senior counsel for the applicants proceeded with argument on the first day of the hearing on the assumption that the matter could be approached in terms of the legal argument to which the proposed minute of amended notice of appeal was directed. 73 The Commissioner opposed the amendment being granted on two primary grounds.
 The only issue insofar as the $200,000 was concerned was whether that investment put the applicants in a position different from Mr Sleight as held in Sleight 136 FCR 211. 80 In the course of the hearing and in the course of subsequent written submissions I was taken to extracts from the transcript which supported this construction of the agreement between the parties.
 But it was not put up on the basis that it changed the scheme which was defined in Sleight 136 FCR 211. 83 These difficulties affect grounds 2.2 and 2.3 of the minute of amended notice in the same way. 84 As to ground 2.4, in my view, this does not set out a question of law in the sense required by the AAT Act.
 In relation to these grounds, the applicants argue that the Tribunal erred in law in finding that in making a determination under s 177F(1) of the Act the Tribunal itself had the power to make such a determination and was not subject to the same time limits imposed on the Commissioner under s 170 and s 177G of the Act.
