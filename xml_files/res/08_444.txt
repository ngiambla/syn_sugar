 This was done through various concepts, including the concept of an exempting company (s 160APHBA) --- a company effectively owned (not less than 95%) by prescribed persons (non-residents) (ss 160APHBB and 160APHBF); and the concept of a former exempting company - a company that had ceased to be an exempting company and is not again an exempting company (subs 160APHBE(1)). 3 Effective 1 July 2002, Australia introduced a consolidation regime to allow a wholly owned group of resident entities to consolidate their tax position rather than be treated as separate entities.
 In consequence, the franking and exempting account balances of Austral Holdings (and its wholly owned subsidiaries) as at 1 July 2002 were converted from an 'adjusted amount' basis to a 'tax-paid' basis pursuant to ss 205-10 and 208-111 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 (Cth). 11 On 1 November 2002, Austral Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Austral Refrigeration, elected to form a tax consolidated group effective that day, with Austral Holdings as the head company.
 In consequence, it became an exempting entity under s 208-20 of the ITAA 97, and the Austral Holdings tax consolidated group's exempting surplus converted to a franking surplus under item 10 of s 208-130 of the ITAA 97. 13 On 6 February 2004, Hastie Holdings Pty Ltd ('Hastie Holdings'), the head company of a consolidated group and not effectively owned by non-residents, acquired all the issued shares of Austral Holdings.
 Exempting Credits Item If: A credit of: Arises: 1 The entity had a *franking surplus at the time it became a *former exempting entity (at the time of its transition ) An amount equal to: (a) in a case not covered by paragraph (b) the franking surplus; or (b) if the entity has been a former exempting entity at any time within a period of 12 months before its transition - so much of the franking surplus as would have been the entity's *exempting surplus had it remained a former exempting entity throughout the period' Immediately after its transition 21 Paragraph (b) of s 208-115, item 1 deals expressly with the situation where a former exempting entity reverts to its status as an exempting entity for a period of less than 12 months, and proceeds on the basis that it will become a former exempting entity again when that period of less than 12 months is over.
 These are set out in sections 709-160 to 709-175. (3) In applying those rules to an entity that is a *member of a *consolidated group: (a) Division 208 is to be applied before those rules; and (b) that Division is to be applied just after the entity became a member of the group but, for a *subsidiary member, it is to be applied on the assumption that the subsidiary was not a member of the group at that time. (4) Except as mentioned in paragraph (3)(b), Division 208 has no application to a *subsidiary member of a *consolidated group. ' 24 Section 709-165 provides relevantly as follows: '(1) This section operates if: (a) the *head company of a *consolidated group is neither an exempting entity nor a *former exempting entity; and (b) a *corporate tax entity becomes a *subsidiary member of the group at a time (also the joining time ); and (c) the entity is a *former exempting entity at the joining time. (2) These rules apply to the *consolidated group.
 At all times prior to that date, it was sufficiently owned by Australian residents that it was not 'effectively owned by prescribed persons' (foreign residents: s 208-40), and thus not an exempting entity under s 208-20. (2) Under s 208-50 a corporate tax entity is a former exempting entity only if it has 'ceased to be an exempting entity and is not, again an exempting entity' and then only 'subject to subsection (2)' (subs (1)).
 But for subs 208-50(2), Austral Holdings would on that date have become a former exempting entity , but subs (2) precludes that outcome: 6 February 2004 is 'within 12 months after' 9 July 2003, the date on which Austral Holdings first became an exempting entity . (4) It follows that Austral Holdings is not a former exempting entity as defined in Div 208. 26 However, there are some additional rules that can alter the way that Div 208 applies to a consolidated group.
 In applying these rules to an entity that is a member of a tax consolidated group, Div 208 is to be applied before these rules and Div 208 is to be applied just after the entity became a member of the group, but on the assumption that the subsidiary member was not a member of the group at that time: subs 709-155(3). 27 The applicants accept that where Austral Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Austral Refrigeration, elected to form a tax consolidated group on 1 November 2002, Austral Holdings became a former exempting entity by force of the rule in item 1 of subs 709-165(2), but only as the head company of the Austral Holdings consolidated group; according to the applicants, Austral Holdings did not, at that time, become a former exempting entity for any other purpose because until 9 July 2003, it had never been an exempting entity and therefore could never have ceased to be an exempting entity : see subs 208-50(1).
 It is apparent from the Explanatory Memorandum to the New Business Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill (No 2) 2002, which preceded the Act which introduced Subdiv 709-B into the ITAA 97, that Subdiv 709-B was intended to apply the exempting entity provisions in Div 208 to a consolidated group in a manner consistent with two principles: first, that the consolidated group would operate its franking account at the head entity level; and second, that the franking surplus accumulated by corporate tax entities during a period of effective ownership by non-residents should be quarantined. 38 Where the head company was a no status entity (neither an exempting entity nor a former exempting entity ) at the time a subsidiary member, which was either an exempting entity or a former exempting entity, became a member of the group, this was intended to be achieved by the head company taking over the status of that subsidiary member.
 If Austral Holdings had not become effectively owned by non-residents on 9 July 2003, that is it remained a former exempting entity until 6 February 2004 when it was taken over by Hastie Holdings, then at 6 February 2004 the exempting surplus of Austral Holdings would have become an exempting surplus of Hastie Holdings, so that the restrictions imposed by the legislative scheme would have continued to operate with respect to those exempting credits; or 2.
 Alternatively, if Austral Holdings became effectively owned by non-residents on 9 July 2003 but the period of such ownership had continued for more than 12 months before Austral Holdings was taken over by Hastie Holdings, again, the present issue would not have arisen, and the franking credits of Austral Holdings would have become exempting credits of Hastie Holdings at the time when Austral Holdings was taken over. 40 The applicants' case is based upon the proposition that a significantly different result now obtains, such that the exempting credits of Austral Holdings are liberated from the restrictions of the legislative scheme under Div 208, as a consequence of one factual event, combined with a suggested interpretation of subs 208-50(2).
