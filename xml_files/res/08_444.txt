 In consequence, the franking and exempting account balances of Austral Holdings (and its wholly owned subsidiaries) as at 1 July 2002 were converted from an 'adjusted amount' basis to a 'tax-paid' basis pursuant to ss 205-10 and 208-111 of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 (Cth). 11 On 1 November 2002, Austral Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Austral Refrigeration, elected to form a tax consolidated group effective that day, with Austral Holdings as the head company.
 If Austral Holdings had not become effectively owned by non-residents on 9 July 2003, that is it remained a former exempting entity until 6 February 2004 when it was taken over by Hastie Holdings, then at 6 February 2004 the exempting surplus of Austral Holdings would have become an exempting surplus of Hastie Holdings, so that the restrictions imposed by the legislative scheme would have continued to operate with respect to those exempting credits; or 2.
 Alternatively, if Austral Holdings became effectively owned by non-residents on 9 July 2003 but the period of such ownership had continued for more than 12 months before Austral Holdings was taken over by Hastie Holdings, again, the present issue would not have arisen, and the franking credits of Austral Holdings would have become exempting credits of Hastie Holdings at the time when Austral Holdings was taken over. 40 The applicants' case is based upon the proposition that a significantly different result now obtains, such that the exempting credits of Austral Holdings are liberated from the restrictions of the legislative scheme under Div 208, as a consequence of one factual event, combined with a suggested interpretation of subs 208-50(2).
