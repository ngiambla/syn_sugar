 The effect of the orders was that the receivers could appropriate out of the net proceeds of sale their costs (that is their costs, charges, expenses and remuneration) incurred between 28 November 2006 and 9 December 2007, which had been assessed in the amount of $1,143,171.26.
 Second, the order appointing the Mews receivers (made on 28 November 2006) required them to carry out enquiries so as to identify all persons who might have a claim upon the fund created by the sale of the Mews scheme assets, and all persons who were prior encumbrancers of the Mews land.
 It calculates the profit to be the sale price of the Mews land ($22,863,636), less the agreed costs base of the Mews land ($8,000,000), less development costs ($1,424,378) and other other expenses and adjustments (to which no figure has been attributed at this stage, but which is likely to be around $893,258).
