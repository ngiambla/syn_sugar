 The claim falls within the principles stated by a Full Court in Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at [20] , [22](i) and [88] --- [90]; see also Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1978) 36 FLR 244 at 245. 7 The claim for privilege appears to me to have been properly made by the description of SG 32 and in [11] of Mr Gregson's affidavit.
 The ACCC does not dispute that it intends to call evidence to that effect. 9 It is true, as was submitted by the ACCC, that it has not sought to rely upon any privileged advice in advancing the evidence referred to in the affidavits of Mr Pearson and Mr Owbridge. 10 It is also true that, ordinarily, a statement such as that made by Mr Owbridge to the effect that no legal advice had been requested on a particular topic would not involve any inconsistency between the statement and the maintenance of confidentiality of advice on other topics. 11 However, three difficulties arise for the ACCC.
