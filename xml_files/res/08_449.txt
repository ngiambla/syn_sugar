 Introduction: 1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC") has claimed legal professional privilege over the redacted portions of the exhibits referred to in [10 of the affidavit of Mr Scott Gregson of 14 March 2008. 2 Redacted portions of those exhibits were produced by the ACCC in answer to paragraphs 5(d) and (e) of a notice to produce dated 25 February 2008. 3 The parties are content for me to decide Korean Air Lines' ("KAL's") notice of motion filed 31 March 2008 on their written submissions without hearing oral argument. 4 Two questions arise on the motion.
 The claim falls within the principles stated by a Full Court in Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 122 ; (2004) 136 FCR 357 at [20] , [22](i) and [88] --- [90]; see also Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1978) 36 FLR 244 at 245. 7 The claim for privilege appears to me to have been properly made by the description of SG 32 and in [11] of Mr Gregson's affidavit.
 The ACCC does not dispute that it intends to call evidence to that effect. 9 It is true, as was submitted by the ACCC, that it has not sought to rely upon any privileged advice in advancing the evidence referred to in the affidavits of Mr Pearson and Mr Owbridge. 10 It is also true that, ordinarily, a statement such as that made by Mr Owbridge to the effect that no legal advice had been requested on a particular topic would not involve any inconsistency between the statement and the maintenance of confidentiality of advice on other topics. 11 However, three difficulties arise for the ACCC.
 I must therefore infer that the redacted portions of the documents go to those topics. 13 Third, Mr Owbridge asserts he told Mr Lloyd that his understanding was that no legal advice had been requested as to whether reasonable grounds existed for the commencement of proceedings. 14 The statements in the affidavits of Mr Pearson and Mr Owbridge walk a very fine line between the maintenance of confidentiality in the legal advice and implied assertions that are inconsistent with it: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] ; Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Ltd [2006] FCAFC 86 ; (2006) 151 FCR 341 at [52] . 15 At present, Mr Owbridge's assertion does not rise above a statement of his understanding which he communicated to Mr Lloyd. 16 On the other hand, Mr Pearson's affidavit contains two assertions.
