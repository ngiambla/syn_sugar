 IS THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT A CHAPTER III COURT? 6 The applicant submits that it is impermissible for Parliament to appoint magistrates instead of judges to the Federal Magistrates Court because s 72 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Cth) ('the Constitution ') only empowers Parliament to appoint judges.
 The power provided by the FMC Bankruptcy Rules to extend time for compliance under the bankruptcy notice arises under Item 4 of Sch 2 of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules and the power to amend the bankruptcy notice arises under Item 2 of Sch 2 of the same Rules. 37 Regulation 3.01 of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules sets out the requirements for an application for an order for substituted service.
