 On 9 August 2007 the proceedings were referred to this Court for the determination of the issues raised by the applicant. 5 The applicant's amended application dated 4 February 2008 objected to the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court and to the power of the Registrar or any Federal Magistrate of such court to make the orders for the issue of the bankruptcy notice and for its substituted service.
 IS THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT A CHAPTER III COURT? 6 The applicant submits that it is impermissible for Parliament to appoint magistrates instead of judges to the Federal Magistrates Court because s 72 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Cth) ('the Constitution ') only empowers Parliament to appoint judges.
 The power provided by the FMC Bankruptcy Rules to extend time for compliance under the bankruptcy notice arises under Item 4 of Sch 2 of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules and the power to amend the bankruptcy notice arises under Item 2 of Sch 2 of the same Rules. 37 Regulation 3.01 of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules sets out the requirements for an application for an order for substituted service.
