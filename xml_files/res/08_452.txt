 1 Before the Court is a notice of motion filed by the Commonwealth of Australia ('the Commonwealth') on 30 January 2008 seeking to strike out the application of Mr Croker. 2 Although not specified in his application, Mr Croker's claim arises out of his purchase of a pair of cufflinks from the High Court of Australia ('the High Court') in late 2003.
 The respondent in such proceedings was the High Court. 5 In support of his application to the CTTT Mr Croker provided an affidavit sworn on 16 March 2005. 6 Mr Croker's claim before the CTTT was stated to be: ... for general damages, damages for inconvenience, repair to goods and costs as to the law of contract and in torts.
 Federal Court proceedings NSD 2478 of 2006 17 On 19 December 2006 Mr Croker instituted proceedings in this Court against the Commonwealth claiming damages in the sum of $100,000 'or other amount' in respect of his claim arising from the supply of the cufflinks. 18 By its letter dated 16 January 2007 the Commonwealth made an offer of settlement to Mr Croker.
 Transfer of proceedings NSD 2478 of 2006 to Federal Magistrates Court 21 On 6 February 2007 proceedings NSD 2478 of 2006 instituted in the Federal Court of Australia were transferred pursuant to an order of Justice Stone to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia and re-numbered SYG 548 of 2007. 22 On 7 March 2007 the Commonwealth sought details of Mr Croker's claim of $100,000 or other amount as referred to in the application filed in the proceedings.
 Security for costs ordered in the Federal Magistrates Court 26 On 5 April 2007 the Commonwealth applied for security for costs in the Federal Magistrates Court. 27 On 29 May 2007 Mr Croker filed an application for a stay in the Federal Magistrates Court 'until the outcome of an application to the High Court of Australia' .
 No such application existed. 28 By his judgment delivered on 14 August 2007 Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones dismissed the application for a stay and ordered that security for costs to the Commonwealth in the amount of $30,000 be paid by 4.00 pm on 11 September 2007.
 Second application for leave to appeal: proceedings NSD 1668 of 2007 30 On 21 August 2007 Mr Croker filed an application in this Court seeking leave to appeal against the orders of Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones made on 14 August 2007. 31 On 17 October 2007 the application for leave to appeal against such orders was dismissed by Buchanan J.
 The submissions claim that he has a cause of action against the Commonwealth and that the 'contravention of law therefore occasions a right to the Applicant for loss, damages and costs' . 44 The written submissions refer to the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Cth).
 Mr Croker submits that the Commonwealth: ... has contravened the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, consumer protection codes and in particular, the due process and equal protection provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (Imp) Chapter 1, Part V. [sic] s. 51 ss. (xxiv) and (xxv)... 45 The written submissions also refer to the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
 Those proceedings were dismissed because Mr Croker did not comply with the order made by Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones on 31 October 2007. 48 The statements of claim in both proceedings NSD 2478 of 2006 and in the current proceedings include claims under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), breach of warranty and a claim for 'wrongfully defending a claim' .
