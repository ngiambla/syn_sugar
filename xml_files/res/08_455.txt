 Mr Cahill, the head of financial institution products at ANZ, said that the agreement follows the form of the Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement (AMSLA), which has been the standard form stock lending agreement in Australia since at least 1999.
 The ANZ agreement is, in all material respects, the same as that used by OP Securities. 16 Mr Cahill said that under ANZ's Equity Finance Facility ANZ borrowed securities from OPS and in return provided collateral to OPS generally in the form of cash.
 It seems tolerably clear that OPS lent this cash to its clients to enable them to purchase the shares that were then "lent" to OP Securities in accordance with the agreement between the plaintiffs and OP Securities.
 To a layperson this may, not unfairly, be described as a form of back to back financing. 17 ANZ also lent securities to OPS in return for the provision of collateral, either in the form of cash or securities.
