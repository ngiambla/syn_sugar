 Mr Cahill, the head of financial institution products at ANZ, said that the agreement follows the form of the Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement (AMSLA), which has been the standard form stock lending agreement in Australia since at least 1999.
 The ANZ agreement is, in all material respects, the same as that used by OP Securities. 16 Mr Cahill said that under ANZ's Equity Finance Facility ANZ borrowed securities from OPS and in return provided collateral to OPS generally in the form of cash.
