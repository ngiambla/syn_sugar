 Did the notice comply with subpara 501G(1)(f)(iv) of the Act? 16 The letter that was delivered by hand to Mr Pomare on 17 October 2007 enclosed various documents, one of which was headed "INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEW RIGHTS FOR VISAS CANCELLED UNDER SECTION 501 OF THE MIGRATION ACT 1958 ".
 The notice must, in addition, state "where" the application to the Tribunal for review can be made. 20 The AAT Act does not throw much light on the answer to the question where the application to the Tribunal for review can be made.
 In my opinion, in order to state where an application for review by the Tribunal can be made, the written notice must state the place where the person can cause the Tribunal to receive his or her application, and so, in the present case, cause the time limit fixed in s 500(6B) of the Act to cease to run. 23 It was common ground that the application would be received by the Tribunal, and therefore made, only when it reached a registry office of the Tribunal.
