 Mr Nathan was not induced to take out the loan with the Respondent that he took out on the basis of a representation made by Mr McCredie because no such representation was ever made, by him or by anyone else, for or on behalf of the Respondent.
 His Honour did not find it necessary to deal with the issue whether Mr McCredie was authorised, in any event, to make such a representation on behalf of the respondent.
 Section 60 13 Ground five of the notice of appeal contains the allegation that the primary judge erred in his approach to the allegations of harassment and coercion made under s 60 of the Act .
