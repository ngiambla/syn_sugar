 The FMCA had dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the RRT') which was handed down on 25 July 2006.
 The RRT decision had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ('the Minister') on 26 November 2004 to refuse the applicant's application for a protection (Class XA) visa. 2 I explained in my judgment of 12 December 2007 that the appeal had been listed for hearing on three occasions.
 By notice of motion filed on 22 January 2008 the applicant asked for the exercise of this discretion so that his appeal may be restored to the list and heard.
