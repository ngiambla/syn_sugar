 Therefore, the Minister submits, the contact the applicant had with the mother and sister both residing in Afghanistan prevented the applicant from meeting the criteria for the visa. 18 This construction, the Minister submits, is supported by the operation of s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) ( Contra. applicant's submissions at [21]), which provides: 'In any Act, unless the contrary intention appears: (a) ... (b) words in the singular number include the plural and words in the plural number include the singular. ' 19 As to the second contention, at [23] of his submissions, the applicant contends that the evidential burden on the applicant and the absence of language intending disqualification, mean that the matters at reg 1.15(a) --- (e) take on qualifying factors.
 Read in context, that is, read in the context of reg 1.15 as a whole, the basis of the concept is that the visa applicant must not have more than three overseas near relatives --- even if he had not had contact with any of them during the relevant period: reg 1.15(1)(d); or if he has three or a lesser number of overseas near relatives, he only satisfies the requirement of reg 1.15(1)(c)(ii) if he has not had contact with any of them within the relevant period. 24 In my view, the Tribunal did not fail, constructively or otherwise, to exercise its jurisdiction by failing to ask the correct question.
