 Early in January 2007, Kawasaki became aware that the PrixCar shares registered in the name of ARC Strang were only legally held by it as trustee and that the beneficial owner of the shares was The A.R.C.
 Although a sale of the shares in ARC Strang would change the ultimate ownership and effective control of the shares ARC Strang held in PrixCar, a desire by the shareholders in ARC Strang to sell the shares they held in it does not, of itself, demonstrate a desire by ARC Strang to transfer its shares in PrixCar.
 There is no direct evidence from Mr Strang, either oral or documentary, which demonstrates a desire by ARC Strang to transfer its shares in PrixCar after 23 November 2006 and up to and including 30 May 2007.
 It is not an admission by Mr Robert Strang or ARC Strang and although it identifies the consequences of the proposal, in relation to control of the shares in PrixCar, it nevertheless shows that what was intended was the acquisition of the shares in ARC Strang.
