 Although a sale of the shares in ARC Strang would change the ultimate ownership and effective control of the shares ARC Strang held in PrixCar, a desire by the shareholders in ARC Strang to sell the shares they held in it does not, of itself, demonstrate a desire by ARC Strang to transfer its shares in PrixCar.
 There is no direct evidence from Mr Strang, either oral or documentary, which demonstrates a desire by ARC Strang to transfer its shares in PrixCar after 23 November 2006 and up to and including 30 May 2007.
