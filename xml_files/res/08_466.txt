 The applicants submit that each of the "explicit threats" by Lane constituted a separate breach of s 170NC by both Lane and the CFMEU and therefore each can and should be the subject of a separate penalty.
 The respondents submit that the application and the amended statement of claim allege only one contravention of s 170NC and seek only the imposition of one penalty in respect of the conduct pleaded.
 There is a long and well-documented history of unlawful activity by union organisers and delegates in the building industry in Australia that counsel for the CFMEU acknowledged, but submitted that there has been a considerable change in culture over recent years.
