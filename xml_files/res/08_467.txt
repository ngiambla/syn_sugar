 By their amended statement of claim, the PFA and TPA have alleged that the Secretary of TPA, a Senior Sergeant Paul Mullett ("Mullett") has been engaged on behalf of TPA in industrial negotiations and the prosecution in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ("the AIRC") of industrial disputes with the Commissioner and has also campaigned against proposed changes to the Police Regulation Act 1958 (Vic) ("the PRA ").
 As well, the anomaly created by a full time union official and officer of TPA being at the same time a serving police officer was adverted to by the Ombudsman in Recommendation 5 of his report on the investigation of the Bullying Allegations which is reproduced at [34] above. 82 Also capable of being inspired by industrial considerations was the publication on 21 September 2006 to all staff of Victoria Police of the outcome of the initial investigation and the referral to WorkSafe.
 It should be assumed, according to this argument, that those members have acquiesced in any delay until the hearing and determination of the action and are content for it to occur. 89 On behalf of the respondents it was argued that, in assessing the balance of convenience, the personal concerns of Mullett have to be weighed against a broad public interest in the continued investigation of the Bullying Allegations which have been alleged to amount to serious misconduct within the meaning of s 86A of the PRA .
