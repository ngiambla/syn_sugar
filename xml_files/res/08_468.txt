 I would not, at the moment, say anything about the costs of the administration; that is a topic best left for consideration by the liquidator. 4 The most active question dealt with today is the order for costs of the proceeding.
 Counsel for the second defendant submits that an indemnity should be granted to his client for orders for costs against her, either in whole or in part, from the third and fourth defendants. 5 It is submitted for the second defendant, and also for Vatera, that the real fault here lies with the third and fourth defendants, when the events leading to the DOCA are properly considered.
 However, I think, in a practical sense, it can be said that, leaving aside any default on the part of the second defendant, the third and fourth defendants probably are primarily responsible for the defects which led to the order being made. 6 However, the costs which are in question here are the costs of this proceeding, and this proceeding was actively defended by the second defendant.
