 BUCHANAN J: 1 The notice of motion at present before the Court seeks that an application for leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment of Tamberlin J ( Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065) be heard and determined by a Full Court, that the appeal be heard together with the application for leave to appeal and that the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and the appeal be expedited.
 Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 505 ( 'Sharman' ) is an example of a subsequent case where it was directed that an application for an extension of time and leave to appeal be dealt with by a single judge and not, as had been sought, by a Full Court.
 In earlier judgments concerning the application for preliminary discovery Tamberlin J struck out the bulk of a notice to produce served by the respondents ( Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1348 --- 31 August 2007) and rejected objections by the respondents to evidence filed by the applicant in support of its application for preliminary discovery ( Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1560 --- 12 October 2007). 4 In the judgment in respect of which the application for leave to appeal is brought Tamberlin J dismissed the application for preliminary discovery on two grounds.
 The possibility of confusion about whether a right to appeal against a refusal to grant leave to appeal may now be argued to exist also tells in favour, in my view, of a reference to a Full Court, if sought, in other than a reasonably clear case for the grant or refusal of leave. 13 Whether a judgment deals with a point of substance with final consequences, rather than a point of practice or procedure (a normal consideration for the grant of leave in any event) may also be important.
