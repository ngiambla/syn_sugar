 BUCHANAN J: 1 The notice of motion at present before the Court seeks that an application for leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment of Tamberlin J ( Optiver Australia Pty Ltd v Tibra Trading Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2065) be heard and determined by a Full Court, that the appeal be heard together with the application for leave to appeal and that the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and the appeal be expedited.
 Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 505 ( 'Sharman' ) is an example of a subsequent case where it was directed that an application for an extension of time and leave to appeal be dealt with by a single judge and not, as had been sought, by a Full Court.
