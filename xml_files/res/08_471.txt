 Were the monies advanced by Knightsbridge Finance advanced under the WCH Loan Agreement? 238 The Knightsbridge parties contended that the monies advanced to Meadow Springs by Knightsbridge Finance were advanced under the WCH Loan Agreement and the WCH Charge secures the payment of monies payable by Meadow Springs under the WCH Loan Agreement. 239 Meadow Springs and IMF denied that the monies were advanced under the WCH Loan Agreement.
 In this regard, it is to be noted that the definition of "Specific Agreements" in the WCH Charge includes the WCH Loan Agreement as varied or amended. 269 During oral submissions, Meadow Springs referred to the case of Vickery v Woods (1952) 85 CLR 336 in support of a contention that there had been no novation between Meadow Springs, WCH and the Knightsbridge parties.
 This is evidenced by the fact that WCH accepted that the monies obtained from the exercise of its powers of sale under the charge were held on trust by Knightsbridge Managed Funds as trustee for the Scheme investors, and were disbursed to the Scheme investors accordingly. 290 Accordingly, in my view, there was an assignment in equity of the WCH Charge by WCH to Knightsbridge Managed Funds.
