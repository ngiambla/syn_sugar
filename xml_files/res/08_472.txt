 I wish to advise the court that preliminary findings in NSD 1779 and SAD 153 of 2007 have determined that MEDFIN has without any doubt received the 390,000 due to it pursuant to the settlement deed.
 I hereby formally request that the honourable Court refer the matter to the Registrar for his consideration to appoint Pro Bono Counsel. 7 On 4 February 2008 there was again no appearance for the Applicant, perhaps not surprisingly given the terms of his January letters.
 On that occasion the Respondent sought an order that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant to O 32, r 2(1)(c) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). 8 Intervening, namely on 29 January 2008, a sequestration order was made against the Applicant in the Federal Magistrates Court in Melbourne.
