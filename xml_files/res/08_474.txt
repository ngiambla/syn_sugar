 Mr Denoon believed that for capital gains tax purposes the Carringbush Trust's unrealised losses on the Rothwell shares could only be offset against future capital gains in the Trust if those losses were realised and that those losses might be realised by a sale or disposition of the Rothwells shares for their market value by CPL to CCPL.
 Mr Denoon believed that amount to be the true value of the total parcel of shares. 9 On 26 May 1993, Mr Denoon executed a document entitled 'Agreement between Carringbush Pty Limited (as Trustee for the Carringbush Unit Trust) and Carringbush Corporation Pty Limited' to effect a sale by CPL as trustee of the Carringbush Trust of all of the shares for a consideration of $1.00.
 The consideration of $1.00 was paid by way of a set-off against a liability owed by CPL and recorded in the books of account. 10 Mr Denoon says that the sale of 26 May 1993 was intended to effect a crystallisation of a capital loss on the investment in the Rothwells shares which to that date, had not been realised by a disposal.
