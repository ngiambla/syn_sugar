 In my view the correspondence exchanged between the date of Dr Wenkart's s 73 proposal and the date that his bankruptcy was annulled makes plain that Dr Wenkart, by his solicitor, requested a taxation of all of Cutler Hughes Harris' costs for services provided to Mr Pantzer as trustee of Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate.
 The terms of Ms Sexton's appointment tend to confirm this understanding of the taxation request made by Dr Wenkart. 77 Moreover, for the reasons set out below, I accept that this proceeding has been conducted on the basis that Mr Pantzer agreed to have the bills of costs of Cutler Hughes Harris taxed.
 Those orders in effect, obliged Mr Pantzer to require the persons who had provided services to him with respect to Dr Wenkart's bankrupt estate (other than Cutler Hughes Harris) to supply bills of costs pursuant to s 167 of the Bankruptcy Act and additionally obliged Mr Pantzer to notify Dr Wenkart of his claim for remuneration in respect of services provided after the annulment of Dr Wenkart's bankruptcy.
 CONCLUSION ON CROSS-CLAIM 90 As already mentioned, order 1 of the consent orders of 11 March 2002 recorded that Dr Wenkart relevantly agreed to pay the remuneration, costs, charges and expenses to which Mr Pantzer was lawfully entitled or may become lawfully entitled "within 28 days of determination of the quantum of the same".
