 Clauses 22 and 24 of the Collective Agreement, like the other terms of that agreement, were not aspirational statements. 27 There is no doubt that the University and Professor Rickard were aware in a general sense of a need to consult with affected persons and their trade union representatives.
 Consultation at least allows employees or, where appropriate, their trade union to influence the taking of a decision by an employer. 33 These matters noted, I accept that the fact that the University did engage in some consultation, albeit not at all of the stages contemplated in the Collective Agreement, is a mitigating factor.
 It seems to me that a need for general deterrence dictates that some penalty ought to be imposed on the University. 37 The University is constituted under the Central Queensland University Act 1998 (Qld) as a body corporate --- s 4 , Central Queensland University Act 1998 .
