 Mr Briskey but not Mr Stokes would have had a key to the building. 32 Mr Brown , now the Australian Ambassador to Sweden was the head of the Australian Mission as High Commissioner in Islamabad in October 2001, and a foreign affairs officer of over 30 years' experience. 33 The contingent of Australians in the Mission was reduced from about 13 to five after 9/11.
 Now, after 39 years in the foreign service, he knew of no occasion when an Australian citizen had been brought to Australian diplomatic premises by officials of the host country for interview and intended return to detention in that country. 34 Mr Brown generally confirmed the evidence of Mr Adams and Mr Briskey as to Mr Stokes' and Mr Briskey's, but not Mr Adams' involvement at meetings with Mr Habib.
 The possible effects of his condition and then recent history and of his subsequent history could well account for what I think is his mistaken belief, apparently prompted by Mr Khan, that he was taken to the Australian High Commission.
