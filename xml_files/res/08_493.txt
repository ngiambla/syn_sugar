 AIA submits that the applicants knew this claim was false and that the applicants knowingly maintained the litigation raising groundless contentions based upon such false claim. 4 The Court made factual findings that Mr Yang received cash for the renewal of Mr Xu's policies which was evidenced by the issue of the receipts; that contrary to Mr Yang's claim no authority was provided to him by Ms Lin of AIA to issue the receipts, and that Mr Yang had attempted to conceal the payments by providing the AIA clerk with a false reason for the attempted reinstatement of the policies of Mr Xu. 5 AIA submits that the principles referred to by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Company and Another v Cussons Pty Limited (1993) 46 FCR 225 apply in respect of proceedings which are conducted in such manner such as to warrant an order for indemnity costs.
 The Calderbank letter attached copies of the receipts and copies of correspondence written by Mr Xu to AIA complaining that although he had paid cash to Mr Yang for the renewal of his policies his policies had been cancelled.
 Since these matters largely occupied hearing time from 11 September 2007, in accordance with the principles in Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd and Others (No 2) (1996) 72 FCR 151 at 156-158 and Amadio Pty Ltd and Another v Henderson and Others (1998) 81 FCR 149 at 258-259, the Court will order the applicants to pay indemnity costs to AIA from that date. 23 Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicants should pay the costs of AIA on an indemnity basis from 11 September 2007 until the conclusion of the hearing.
