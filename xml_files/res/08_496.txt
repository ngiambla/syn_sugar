 It is alleged that at all times Adelaide Brighton Cement and CCL, NCL and SCL were in the business of manufacturing for supply within Australia bulk cement and the sale within Australia of bulk cement to customers, including customers in the locations within which CGA and the applicant through CGA sold bulk cement. 12 It is alleged that there are seven different geographical markets for the sale of bulk cement to buyers.
 In paragraph 18 it is alleged that the Restraint Instrument and/or the Restraint of Trade Clause are exclusionary provisions within the meaning of s 4D(1) of the TPA, and in paragraph 19 it is alleged that by enforcing or threatening to enforce the Restraint Instrument and/or the Restraint of Trade Clause, Adelaide Brighton Cement has purported to give effect to the Restraint Instrument and/or the Restraint of Trade Clause within the meaning and in contravention of s 45(2)(b)(i) of the TPA.
 Clause 3.5(a) falls within s 51(2)(b) and it follows that regard is not to be had to it in determining whether there have been contraventions of s 45(2)(b)(i) or s 45(2)(b)(ii) or s 47 of the TPA. 42 In my opinion, if regard is not had to cl 3.5(a) the TPA claims must fail because when the pleadings are carefully analysed it is clear that the TPA claims have cl 3.5(a) as their basis. 43 Finally, I should mention one submission made by Adelaide Brighton Cement.
