 Her Honour also noted that the Tribunal informed the appellants of its concern regarding the lack of evidence and had adjourned the hearing to allow for the presentation of further evidence.
 The application to amend the notice of appeal is rejected because the proposed grounds of appeal were not grounds upon which the appellants relied in their application for judicial review before the Federal Magistrates Court and each of the grounds lack merit.
 The application to adduce further evidence is refused because leave to amend the notice of appeal has been refused and, in those circumstances, the proposed evidence is not relevant to any of the existing grounds of appeal.
