 It remitted to the Repatriation Commission the assessment of the rate of pension payable to Mr Hill in respect of that condition. 9 The AAT rejected the claim based on the condition of PTSD because it was not satisfied that Mr Hill suffered from that condition at all.
 It rejected the claim based upon pathological gambling, in respect of which no SOP had been published, because there was no reasonable hypothesis connecting the condition of pathological gambling suffered by Mr Hill with his operational service. 10 The Repatriation Commission has appealed from the decision of the AAT concerning the eligibility of Mr Hill for a disability pension by reason of alcohol dependence.
 In the context of the issues it was considering, I think that conclusion clearly represents a finding as to the hypothesis that his psychiatric disorder arose in Vietnam before the clinical onset of alcohol dependence and continued to exist to and at the time of the clinical onset of alcohol dependence.
 The fact that both alcohol intoxication and alcohol dependence arose after Mr Hill commenced his operational service was clearly consistent with his and other's evidence about his alcohol consumption before that time, although it noted one drinking episode before that time which (the AAT said) fitted with the diagnostic description of alcohol intoxication.
