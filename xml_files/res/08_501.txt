 The Tribunal also found that the appellant would be provided with State protection for any private harm that he feared. 15 The Tribunal was therefore not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution and affirmed the decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa.
 The Tribunal committed a jurisdictional error by misapprehending the applicants claim and failing to conduct a review the delegate's decision in accordance with the particular social group that the applicant claims to be a member of / failing to address all integers of the claim. 2.
 However, it is clear that the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the harm feared was not essentially and significantly related to the Applicant's membership of that particular social group, albeit the wider group, but rather was private in nature.
 The Tribunal also rejected the appellant's claim that he was a member of a particular social group which meant that he was liable to persecution. 29 In those circumstances, the first respondent's submission that the issue of State protection did not arise must be accepted.
