 Subsequent to the hearing held on 12 September 2006, on 13 September 2006 the Tribunal wrote to the applicant advising that it required further information, in particular, in relation to discrepancies between the evidence given by Mr Jarjo and Mr Nassif, and the appellant.
 In that letter to the appellant, the Tribunal pointed out the differences between that evidence and the claim in the appellant's solicitor's letter that both Mr Nassif and Mr Jarjo had repaid the loans "not in cash but in kind".
