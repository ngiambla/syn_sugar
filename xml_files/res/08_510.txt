 See, eg, BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia [1966] AC 224 , at 264; Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 , at 648; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Foxwood (Tolga) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 24 ; (1981) 147 CLR 278 , at 285, 293.
 If, upon consideration of all those factors, it appears that, notwithstanding the disproportion between outgoing and income, the whole outgoing is properly to be characterized as genuinely and not colourably incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, the entire outgoing will fall within the first limb of s51(1) unless it is either somehow excluded by the exception of "outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature" or "incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income".
 In the event that the Tribunal is of the view that the expenditure claimed by the Applicants is not properly allowable under the general deduction provisions of section 51(1) of the 1936 Act and the consequential non application of Part IVA of the 1936 Act, the Applicant is not liable to pay any penalties pursuant to section 224(2) of the 1936 Act. 81.
