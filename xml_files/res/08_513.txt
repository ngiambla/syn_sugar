 1 This is a notice of motion which is brought by Mr Mark Simonsen to set aside orders of the Court that were made by consent on 10 March 2008 allowing an appeal against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court and ordering that the bankruptcy of Mr Legge be annulled. 2 It is necessary to set out some of the circumstances to explain the background of this application. 3 Mr Legge was made bankrupt on 22 March 2004 on a petition which was brought by Mackinlays, a firm of solicitors.
 Parties to that application were Mackinlays, Mr Legge, and it also appears from the appeal book that the Official Trustee appeared before the Federal Magistrates Court with leave. 5 Mr Legge then appealed against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court.
 The evidence shows that Mr Simonsen learned from the conversation that he had with Ms Cameron from the office of the Official Trustee, that Mr Legge had made an application for the annulment of his bankruptcy to the Federal Magistrates Court and had been unsuccessful in that application.
 Instead, Mr Simonsen awaited the outcome of the hearing of the appeal and then for the first time, raised with the Court, albeit informally, his complaint about not having been notified of Mr Legge's annulment application to the Federal Magistrates Court. 16 In my view, it is now too late for Mr Simonsen to apply to become a party to the appeal.
