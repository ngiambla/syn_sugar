 Dr McGrath for the second, third and fourth respondents has however submitted that the costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis. 3 In relation to this matter I note that it is not in dispute that the first respondent, Ms Booth, has not been served in these proceedings.
 Accordingly Ms Booth has not been represented in Court during the course of these proceedings and is not entitled to the benefit of any costs order. 4 Further, I understand that the respondents were first made aware of the applicants' notice of discontinuance this morning immediately prior to the hearing.
 The proceeding was an abuse of the process of the Court. 6 It is not in dispute that the parties have been involved in extended litigation in the Queensland Planning and Environment Court and the Court of Appeal in Queensland in relation to issues subsequently raised in the applicants' statement of claim in the Federal Court of Australia.
 This was particularly the case in relation to the applicants' claim that, by undertaking the normal work of solicitors for the first respondent in the Queensland Court proceedings, the second, third and fourth respondents were liable for criminal and civil sanctions. 8 Mr Kelso for the applicants submitted that his instructing solicitors were acting as town agents and had only been instructed last week; and that there had been some attempts by the applicants' solicitors to resolve the proceedings before Court today.
