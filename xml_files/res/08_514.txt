 Dr McGrath for the second, third and fourth respondents has however submitted that the costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis. 3 In relation to this matter I note that it is not in dispute that the first respondent, Ms Booth, has not been served in these proceedings.
 The proceeding was an abuse of the process of the Court. 6 It is not in dispute that the parties have been involved in extended litigation in the Queensland Planning and Environment Court and the Court of Appeal in Queensland in relation to issues subsequently raised in the applicants' statement of claim in the Federal Court of Australia.
