 The respondent submits that an exercise of the Court's discretion to this effect would be consistent with what was said by the majority in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [27] - [29] .
 According to the respondent, in assessing whether the appellant engaged in conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his protection claim, the Tribunal found that such conduct was not premised on a genuine intensification of his faith, but rather was for the purpose of strengthening his refugee claims.
