 The respondent submits that an exercise of the Court's discretion to this effect would be consistent with what was said by the majority in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [27] - [29] .
 The Tribunal did take the appellant's conduct into account when determining that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in China on the basis of his Catholic faith, after having found that it should be rejected because of s 91R(3). 23 The appellant submits that the Tribunal erred in so doing.
 According to the respondent, in assessing whether the appellant engaged in conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his protection claim, the Tribunal found that such conduct was not premised on a genuine intensification of his faith, but rather was for the purpose of strengthening his refugee claims.
