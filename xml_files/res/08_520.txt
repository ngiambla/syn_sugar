 In consequence, the Commonwealth falsely imprisoned him there and is liable in damages for that. 2 In my view, the various assertions of illegality cannot be sustained, with the exception of the claim that Mr Soh was owed a duty of procedural fairness that was not fulfilled.
 The following then occurred: On 13 December 1999 Mr Soh wrote a letter to [Mr Nicholls] asking for an explanation of the allegations that he was a trouble maker, a security risk, of bad behaviour and tried to escape when he was at the VIDC ...
 If he also took satisfaction in Mr Soh facing the added discomforts of prison life (which, to a degree, he may well have done) that is, in the light of these findings, insufficient to ground an action against him.
