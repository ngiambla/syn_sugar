 The Tribunal inferred from this information that the deceased veteran's daily intake of animal fat was around, or possibly slightly below, the national average. 12 The Tribunal also held that there were no facts upon which to estimate an average daily fat intake while the deceased was serving in the RAN.
 Amongst other authorities, the Tribunal cited Repatriation Commission v Bey [1997] FCA 1347 ; (1997) 79 FCR 364 where the majority said, at 373: Whether material raises a "reasonable hypothesis" for the purposes of s 120(3) is a question of fact for it involves no more than a determination whether a hypothesis of connection is reasonable: Repatriation Commission v Owens (1996) 70 ALJR 904.
 Such errors are errors of law, appellable under s 44 of the AAT Act: in Roncevich v Repatriation Commission [2005] HCA 40 ; (2005) 222 CLR 115 a majority of the High Court held, at [28], that "[i]n failing to pose and answer the correct question the Tribunal erred in law.
 That error constituted an appealable [sic] error of law within the meaning of s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act ". 21 The applicant contends that the primary issue for determination is whether s 120 of the Act requires direct evidence of a factor required by an SoP in order for a claim to succeed.
 The applicant submits that the Tribunal erred by engaging in fact-finding when applying s 120(3). 22 The applicant relied on Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; 69 ALD 581 , where the Full Court held at [57] that a hypothesis must be supported by material pointing to each element that the SoP makes essential for the hypothesis to be reasonable.
 According to the applicant, the issue was whether the dietary information provided by her and Dr English's opinion of the applicant's overstatement of the veteran's food intake supported the sub-hypothesis of a post-service daily consumption in the order of 187 g of animal fat. 25 The applicant submits that, for these reasons, the Tribunal erred by misconstruing and misapplying s 120(3). 26 The applicant further submits that the Tribunal erred in its application of s 120(1), and the fourth Deledio step.
 If the hypothesis did not fit (because it does not contain the facts which the SoP sets out as the minimum that must exist and be related to the veteran's service) then, according to the respondent, the hypothesis will not be reasonable for the purposes of s 120(3) and the claim must fail. 31 The respondent submits that the applicant has misconceived the authorities in making her submissions.
 The Tribunal then held "[i]f this recall is wrong, then it is equally likely that her recall of the relative proportions of the different foods consumed is also wrong. " The Tribunal further held that there was "no evidence" regarding the amount of fat the deceased consumed in his pre-service years, and "no facts which address the hypothesis of an increase in animal fats by 40%".
 These comments suggest that the Tribunal both crossed the line into impermissible fact finding, and misunderstood the nature of its then preliminary inquiry. 39 In Dixon [1999] FCA 582 ; 29 AAR 235 at [24] Wilcox J further held that at [ Deledio steps 1-3] the decision-maker is not concerned with the accuracy of the material giving rise to the hypothesis; the decision-maker is still working under s 120(3).
 As the Full Court said in Deledio it is only at the step 4 stage of the process "that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it. " 40 The "findings" referred to above were made by the Tribunal in its application of s 120(3).
