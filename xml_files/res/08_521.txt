 The applicant submits that the Tribunal erred by engaging in fact-finding when applying s 120(3). 22 The applicant relied on Hill [2002] FCAFC 192 ; 69 ALD 581 , where the Full Court held at [57] that a hypothesis must be supported by material pointing to each element that the SoP makes essential for the hypothesis to be reasonable.
 The fact that any estimate of fat consumption was speculative was irrelevant, as stated by the majority in Bey 79 FCR at 372: While a hypothesis may be no more than a possibility or supposition , in order for a hypothesis to be reasonable, it must, as East [ v Repatriation Commission [1987] FCA 242 ; (1987) 16 FCR 517] states, be pointed to or supported, and not merely left open as a possibility, by the material before the decision maker. (Emphasis added. ) 24 The applicant submits that it is equally irrelevant whether the recalculation of post-service fat consumption was scientifically valid.
 As the Full Court said in Deledio it is only at the step 4 stage of the process "that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it. " 40 The "findings" referred to above were made by the Tribunal in its application of s 120(3).
 The Tribunal in this matter picked up the language of s 120(1), where it referred to "no sufficient ground" for making a determination that the death was war-caused, and fastened on the language of the majority in Bushell 175 CLR at 416 when referring to the lack of "factual foundation".
