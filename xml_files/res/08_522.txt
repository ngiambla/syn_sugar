 The rejection of the appellant's credibility and the reliability of mere documentary corroboration (for reasons given) provide no basis for inferring that, under cover of silence, the Tribunal also concluded that the applicant's witness, whom the Tribunal saw and heard, was also unreliable.
 It is possible, in my opinion, that a reasonable, well-informed lay observer might suspect that the Tribunal, being otherwise dissatisfied with the appellant's credit, had rejected her witness' testimony regardless of what might have been, independently of the appellant, its intrinsic worth.
