 The Tribunal summarised the evidence as follows: "The witness said that she knows the applicant's history and one of her (the witness') relatives was caught as a Maoist in 2004 and she had heard about the applicant's husband being a Maoist from that relative. " The transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal was tendered before me, and that is, so far as it goes, an accurate summary.
 The rejection of the appellant's credibility and the reliability of mere documentary corroboration (for reasons given) provide no basis for inferring that, under cover of silence, the Tribunal also concluded that the applicant's witness, whom the Tribunal saw and heard, was also unreliable.
 It is possible, in my opinion, that a reasonable, well-informed lay observer might suspect that the Tribunal, being otherwise dissatisfied with the appellant's credit, had rejected her witness' testimony regardless of what might have been, independently of the appellant, its intrinsic worth.
