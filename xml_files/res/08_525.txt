 1 This is an amended notice of motion for leave to amend the application and the statement of claim and also seeking leave to serve the amended originating process out of Australia, pursuant to O 8 r 3(2) of the Federal Court Rules . 2 There are amendments which are proposed to be made to the application and the statement of claim. 3 As to the application, it is proposed to join a new applicant.
 It is Kariba Kono (SL) Limited (Kariba), a company which is incorporated in Sierra Leone, and is the company which actually carries out the tailings operations in Sierra Leone to which I referred in my earlier reasons in this case ( Mineral Commodities Ltd v Promet Engineers Africa (Pty) Ltd [2008] FCA 30). 4 The amendments to the statement of claim introduce claims against the fifth respondent for misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA) (the FTA). 5 There are also amendments proposed in respect of the claims brought against Mr Ford and Mr Bennett, the third and fourth respondents.
 On the basis of the analogy, I am satisfied that there is a prima facie case, in the sense which is necessary for service out of the jurisdiction, in respect of the amended claim which is proposed to be made against Mr Ford and Mr Bennett. 9 I am also satisfied that there is a prima facie case made by the Sierra Leone company, Kariba.
 Accordingly, I am satisfied that there is a prima facie case, in the sense necessary for service out of the jurisdiction in relation to the claim made by Kariba. 10 All the other matters which need to be satisfied in respect of service out of the jurisdiction have already been dealt with in my earlier decision. 11 I am, therefore, content to make the orders which are set out in paras 1 to 6 of the amended notice of motion.
