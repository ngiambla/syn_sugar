 Subsection 86-15(1) then had the effect that Mr Fowler's assessable income included so much of the ordinary income of the Company as was Mr Fowler's personal services income, being, in fact, the whole of the amounts in question. 47 As noted earlier, within Div 6, s 6-10 had the effect that Mr Fowler's assessable income included amounts that were included in his assessable income "by provisions [of the Act] about assessable income", the latter being called statutory income.
 His submission seems to be that because there is an artificial attribution to the individual of amounts that constituted income of the personal services entity according to ordinary concepts, there is some complexity that would not otherwise exist in terms of identifying the time when the income becomes part of the individual's income and the source of the income. 51 In relation to timing, as noted above, s 6-10(3) has no application.
