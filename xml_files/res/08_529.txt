 If the Registrar does not do so by that time, the Registrar must consider, or reconsider, the claim under that section as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards. 29 The applicants submitted that this Item requires the Registrar to apply s 190A to an applicable claim in a very particular way.
 The letter states: Whether or not an extension of time should be granted is assessed on a case by case basis, taking into account statutory timeframes, the applicant's situation, whether a reasonable amount of time has already been allowed and the effect of the delay on third party interests. 62 The applicants complain that the delegate did not give sufficient consideration to all of those factors.
 It seems to me that, by imposing upon the Registrar a nominal deadline of one year within which to consider claims, Item 90(2) clearly aims to have claims for registration tested and decisions made as quickly as the resources of the Tribunal, the applicants and relevant representative bodies will allow.
