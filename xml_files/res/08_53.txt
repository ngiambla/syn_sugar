 They pleaded ([26]) that at no time did 1800 have or make available to Bannerhey a business system or method which was capable of exploiting the telephone number 1800 000 000 or the domain names allocated with it in the manner represented in [7], [9], [10], [12] and [13] and that each of the representations made in these paragraphs constituted conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive ([35]).
 In its defence, 1800 admitted that it represented that a business system and plan had been developed since 1999, but otherwise denied the representation alleged in (a); it also said that it represented to Mr Gretton that 1800 planned to provide initial training to State Master Licensees to further explain to the Licensees and to discuss and consult with the Licensees as to the operation of the 1800 business in accordance with the 1800 Business Model, but otherwise denied the representation alleged in (a).
