 They pleaded ([26]) that at no time did 1800 have or make available to Bannerhey a business system or method which was capable of exploiting the telephone number 1800 000 000 or the domain names allocated with it in the manner represented in [7], [9], [10], [12] and [13] and that each of the representations made in these paragraphs constituted conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive ([35]).
 When I asked him whether a system of marketing was included in that, he said that the marketing strategy --- confidential marketing system and intended marketing slogans --- which were in the Marketing Plan ('DJH14' to Ex. 5), were not initially disclosed, but that he allowed Mr Horton to review the Marketing Plan when he came to Melbourne on 4 July 2001 for the second Horton Melbourne meeting (see [93] below).
 In its defence, 1800 admitted that it represented that a business system and plan had been developed since 1999, but otherwise denied the representation alleged in (a); it also said that it represented to Mr Gretton that 1800 planned to provide initial training to State Master Licensees to further explain to the Licensees and to discuss and consult with the Licensees as to the operation of the 1800 business in accordance with the 1800 Business Model, but otherwise denied the representation alleged in (a).
 In her evidence, Mrs Gretton confirmed that the subject of Mr Gretton leaving Ricoh was only raised after the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement was signed so that whether a representation was made in the form alleged in (e), or whether what was said on the subject was confined to 1800's admission, I am satisfied that in neither case was it relied upon by Bannerhey in entering into the Bannerhey Master Licence Agreement. 157 The same applies to the other alleged representations.
