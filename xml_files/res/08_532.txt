 Section 170WG(1) of the Old Act provided that a person must not apply duress to an employer or employee in connection with an AWA or ancillary document. 7 Regulation 9(3) of the Old Regulations provided that, subject to subregs (4) and (5), an "inspector" (ie an inspector appointed under Pt V of the Old Act) may, subject to any direction of the Minister, inter alia, "institute ... any proceedings... in respect of... a contravention of the Act".
 These include the power to enforce compliance with the Workplace Relations Act , awards and agreements, the freedom of association provisions and the rules for agreement making. 16 Thus when cl 17(1) of Sch 7 of the New Act speaks of provisions of the Old Act, including s 170VV "continu(ing) to apply" in relation to an Old Act AWA, that is to be read as meaning so much of s 170VV as is consistent with the new scheme under the New Act and New Regulations.
 The regulation in question was invalid because it imposed "a distinct and independent addition of liability to the liabilities which the legislature has provided" (at 412). 18 In the present case the respondents eschewed any argument that reg 2.14 was ultra vires and therefore void. 19 The present case is not like Morton where the statute covered the field and left no room for regulations.
