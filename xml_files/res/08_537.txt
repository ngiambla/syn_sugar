 On 11 December 2007, for reasons that it then published, the Tribunal, constituted by Mr Kenny, Member, affirmed the decision under review. 4 Section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) enables an appeal to be brought to this Court from a decision of the Tribunal on a question of law.
 That particular incident features in the course of the Tribunal's reasoning in a way in which I shall relate later. 14 The publication known as DSM-IV was in evidence before the Tribunal and contains the following in respect of diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder: (a) the person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present: (i) the person experienced, witnessed or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others; (ii) the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness or horror.
 In the circumstances of the case this failure constitutes a material error of law. 20 The report in that case was a medical report, but the submission made on behalf of the Applicant was that there was no relevant distinction to be drawn in terms of principle as between the medical report in that case and the written statement to the accuracy of which Mr Drew swore in his oral evidence before the Tribunal.
 It followed from this that having regard to the medical opinion as to the utility of DSM-IV, no factual foundation for a finding of post-traumatic stress disorder was present. 25 That process of reasoning seems to me to have been both logical and reasonably open on the evidence before the tribunal. 26 In these circumstances, the Tribunal has not, in my opinion, erred in law.
