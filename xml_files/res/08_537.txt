 On 11 December 2007, for reasons that it then published, the Tribunal, constituted by Mr Kenny, Member, affirmed the decision under review. 4 Section 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) enables an appeal to be brought to this Court from a decision of the Tribunal on a question of law.
 It followed from this that having regard to the medical opinion as to the utility of DSM-IV, no factual foundation for a finding of post-traumatic stress disorder was present. 25 That process of reasoning seems to me to have been both logical and reasonably open on the evidence before the tribunal. 26 In these circumstances, the Tribunal has not, in my opinion, erred in law.
