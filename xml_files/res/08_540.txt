 If the applicants do not pay a costs order against them (estimated by the respondents to be of the order of $130,000), the relevant respondents can cause Awap to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders such that the first and second applicants' share of that dividend would be sufficient to cover any costs order.
 Pursuant to s 49(2) of the CJE Act, the Court may make an order that the dividend issued to the first and second applicants be paid to the respondents to satisfy the costs order. 19 However, the respondents submit and I accept, that the first and second applicants, as shareholders in Awap, have no entitlement to be paid dividends from Awap's profits.
 I do not regard the mere possibility that the first and second applicants will be the beneficiaries of dividends as amounting to them presently having assets within the jurisdiction. 20 The respondents do not have other realisable assets in Australia which would be available to satisfy an order to pay the respondents' costs.
