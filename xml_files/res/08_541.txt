 In respect of those managed investment schemes alleged by ASIC and which I set out numbered 5 to 10 above, ASIC contends that they were required to be registered as they were managed investment schemes promoted by a person or persons who or which were in the business of promoting managed investment schemes. 5 Without such registration pursuant to subsection 601ED(1) of the Act , a person must not operate the managed investment scheme; that is by virtue of subsection 601ED(5).
 The interim relief sought by ASIC, in terms of the minute of proposed orders is sought pursuant to subsection 1324(4) of the Act to preserve the position where relevant, pending the determination of its substantive application for permanent orders pursuant to subsection 1324(1), together with subsection 601EE(2) of the Act . 6 The definition of managed investment scheme in s 9 of the Act has three features.
 I refer, for example, to the position in relation to communications by the first defendant concerning the installation of sewerage at Lot 515 Sabrina Road, Baldivis and the position which is reflected in a letter from the Water Corporation in reply to Mr Boase, who had written concerning that matter, having received a letter from the first defendant which had given him cause for suspicion.
