 The other motion (brought by the examinee) is for the plaintiff to provide the examinee with copies of all of the documents contained in the bundle of examination documents provided by the plaintiff that were referred to during the course of his examination referred to above. 2 The two motions were preceded with exchanges of correspondence in which documents were requested and declined.
 A creditor and the examinee asserts he is one, may have inspection access to documents as well as the transcript. 23 It is a different question however whether s 597(14A) entitles the Court to order that copies of such documents or pages must be made and produced to an examinee who is ordered to sign the transcript of the examination to authenticate it.
 As previously noted in New Cap [2001] NSWSC 835 at [39] and [43] 'records of the examination' extends to all 'documents which were utilised in the examination either by directly being marked for identification or as otherwise been produced for the examination'. 25 Santow J observed at [43] in New Cap [2001] NSWSC 835 that when one considers s 596F, there is nothing in s 597 (to which s 596F is subject) which precludes the Court making in terms of subpar (e) a 'direction about access to records of the examination'.
