 A claim was subsequently lodged with the Official Trustee by Moti Singh of 4/320 [sic] Glynburn Road, Kensington Gardens in State of South Australia who alleged that the funds held by the Official Trustee were in fact funds to which Mr Singh was the legal owner. 5.
 The applicant further asserts that the funds were initially transferred to a mutual friend, Mr Humayon Kabir of 8B Panorama Road, Mount Wellington, Auckland in New Zealand by International Money Transfer Application dated 13 March 2003 issued by the National Bank of New Zealand. 7.
 Federal Magistrate Driver ordered that the Official Trustee invest the funds in an interest bearing account and to provide a report to the Court on whom the Official Trustee considered was the legal owner of these funds. 11.
 I gave leave to Ms Nash, who appeared for the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, to file affidavits of service in court which deposed to service on Mr Singh of the notice of motion and date of hearing.
