 Such further or other orders as the Court thinks fit. 4 For the reasons indicated at [24] of Duus v Dalvella , since the date of bankruptcy of Mr Waters and Mrs Waters is 22 September 1999 and 28 September 1999 respectively, s 121 of the Act applies in the following terms: SECTION 121 TRANSFERS TO DEFEAT CREDITORS 121(1) Transfers that are void.
 The two paragraphs are said to operate inconsistently in their scope. 39 There is no inconsistency. 40 Paragraph 22 pleads that the 10 transactions comprising the debt drawdowns and gifts back by Waters were part of a scheme orchestrated by them with the intent to defraud their creditors and involved a disposition by Waters of property for no consideration in favour of Dalvella which did not act in good faith.
 These matters are recited as the particulars to para 22 and are set out in full at [16]. 55 On 2 December 1996, Dalvella and Donemate were incorporated; the Cliffside Trust and Kings Beach Trust were established; and Waters retired as principals of each trust seven days after the creation of the trusts, in favour of their children on 9 December 1996.
