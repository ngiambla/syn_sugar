 Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 59 FLR 37, 42; Olin Corporation v Super Cartridge Co Pty Ltd [1977] HCA 23 ; (1977) 180 CLR 236 , 246. 34 ITW alleges that the respondents' fasteners infringe several claims of the Zips screw patent, but the heart of the case boils down to a dispute over whether the respondents' screws in fact possess one of the essential features of the claims of the patent in suit.
 It is thus unsurprising that when his opinion was subjected to scrutiny, Dr Collinson retreated into assertion and equivocation. 46 A second and related evidentiary point is the lack of testing and measurement to support Dr Collinson's opinion regarding the functional significance of a taper in the respondents' fasteners.
 Second, "the best data" backing Dr Collinson's observations as to the functional significance of the taper in the respondents' screws did not involve testing of the allegedly infringing fasteners ; rather, it involved testing fasteners of Dr Collinson's own manufacture, which he considered to be similar to the respondents' fasteners.
