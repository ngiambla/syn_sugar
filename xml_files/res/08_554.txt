 Submissions 21 Jarra Creek correctly submits that the Visy parties bear the onus of establishing privilege, and further submits that, since the Visy parties have not made out a sufficient case to show that the copy documents are covered by privilege, they have not discharged this onus.
 As this has not been done, Jarra Creek says no claim of privilege can be maintained. 25 In response, the Visy parties say that the approach taken by Jarra Creek is too narrow and that it is necessary to take a more pragmatic approach.
 Although the Visy parties do not oppose the granting of such leave, the ACCC submits that leave should not be granted: (a) until the privilege claims which were the subject of Issue 4 are determined; and (b) because it is not appropriate for Jarra Creek to subpoena documents from the ACCC simply because it has been unsuccessful in obtaining those documents from the Visy parties by way of discovery. 38 In my view, it is appropriate to grant leave to issue the subpoenas.
