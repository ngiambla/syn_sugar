 It contended that in breach of the various confidentiality agreements, the first respondent had used and disclosed to others, Lynx's confidential information for the purpose of manufacturing and procuring the manufacture of those rail wagons.
 In addition to the affidavit from Mr Mazur, the instructing solicitor for Lynx has sworn and filed an affidavit making it clear that notwithstanding Mr Mazur's reasons for objecting to disclosure of the second category of documents, Mr Mazur had not expressed those instructions to the instructing solicitors.
 Due to the short timeframe within which WorleyParsons' minute was received (which had been the afternoon before the morning of the directions hearing) the WorleyParsons' minute had not in fact been forwarded to Lynx and thus, while the solicitor had understood that instructions to consent to that minute had been given, in fact they had not.
 The driving factor warranting consideration of exercise of discretion to revoke the order, is the affidavit filed by the solicitors for Lynx from which it is clear that Lynx did not authorise its solicitors to instruct counsel as they did, to consent to inspection of the second category of documents by WorleyParsons.
