 The applicant's argument did not suggest a way in which the singular word "trust" could be made to fit into its construction. 13 The Explanatory Memorandum when Sch 2F was introduced included the following: 13.91 The characterisation of a trust may be affected by whether it is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by another trust.
 An unlisted widely held trust, unlisted very widely held trust or wholesale widely held trust whose fixed entitlements to income and capital are all held, directly or indirectly, by another trust of a higher level will instead be a trust of the same kind as that higher level trust.
 The classification of the D Unit Trust is unaffected by the classifications of the B Unit Trust and C Unit Trust since neither of them owns 100% of it. 14 The concluding sentence is consistent with the Commissioner's construction and inconsistent with that of the applicant.
