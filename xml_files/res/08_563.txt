 The appointment of Mr McGrath and Mr Honey as administrators and later liquidators of Pan followed a decision of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to suspend the manufacturing licences of Pan. 10 Initially the suspension was for a period of six months commencing on 28 April 2003 but subsequently further notices were given under the Therapeutic Goods Act for suspension and product recalls.
 The notices under that Act referred to breaches by Pan of its licence conditions and the standards of the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice. 11 After the commencement of administration of Pan, Mr McGrath and Mr Honey caused a review to be undertaken of the circumstances which resulted in the notices given under the Therapeutic Goods Act .
 As a result of their inquiries the liquidators determined that the matters identified by the report under the Therapeutic Goods Act resulted from systemic failures at Pan and in particular the failure to have in place adequate systems to ensure compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice. 12 The liquidators determined that Pan should commence proceedings in the Federal Court against Mr Selim seeking damages for breach of duties owed to Pan under s 180 of the Corporations Act .
 His Honour also observed at 112 that s 9 of the Corporations Law (which was then in force) defined "property" to include a chose in action. 36 Unlike the Bankruptcy Act , the Corporations Law did not vest the property of the company in liquidation in the liquidator unless an order to this effect was made by the Court.
