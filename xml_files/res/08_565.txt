 That Motion , filed on behalf of the Respondent, seeks a variety of orders including an order that the preservation order as previously made by Cowdroy J (and later varied) be discharged unless the Applicants file and serve proceedings seeking the recovery of assets within 28 days. 9 Of immediate concern, however, is a further order seeking to vacate the order requiring that the Respondent attend in person for cross-examination.
 An application under O 15A does not exclude the availability of other interlocutory procedures of the Court nor exclude the normal rule that a " party may require the attendance for cross-examination of a person making an affidavit ": Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), O 14, r 9.
