 That Motion , filed on behalf of the Respondent, seeks a variety of orders including an order that the preservation order as previously made by Cowdroy J (and later varied) be discharged unless the Applicants file and serve proceedings seeking the recovery of assets within 28 days. 9 Of immediate concern, however, is a further order seeking to vacate the order requiring that the Respondent attend in person for cross-examination.
 An application under O 15A does not exclude the availability of other interlocutory procedures of the Court nor exclude the normal rule that a " party may require the attendance for cross-examination of a person making an affidavit ": Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), O 14, r 9.
 That is a course which was not opposed this morning by Counsel for the Respondent. 17 It is inappropriate to require Senior Counsel for the Applicants to detail in advance the precise questions or even the detailed subject-matter of those areas of factual dispute which will be the focus of any cross-examination.
