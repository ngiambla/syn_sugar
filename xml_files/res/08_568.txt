 Thus, the Taxpayer says, the power to amend at any time conferred by s 170(10AA), is triggered only if the subsequent event occurs after the original assessment is made or is deemed to be made, so necessitating the amendment of the original assessment.
 The Taxpayer contends that in a provision that concerns the amendment of assessments, a power that arises from the occurrence of subsequent events is naturally to be read as one that arises from events subsequent to the assessment to be amended.
 Thus, a new fact arising after the original assessment, namely, non-acquisition of replacement plant, will change the tax liability for that year of income. 30 Each of Items 40, 130 and 140, which refer to ss 104- 15 (4)(a), 126- 5 (3) and 126-45(3) respectively, is concerned with CGT Event B1.
 Nevertheless, it would have been open to the Parliament to enact a provision which made clear that the unlimited power of amendment applied only in relation to an event subsequent to the end of the year of income that occurred after the original assessment or deemed assessment.
