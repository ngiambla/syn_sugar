 It is further pleaded that the use would infringe claims 1 and 8 of the patent, because the use of the product takes all of the integers of both claims 1 and 8. 14 It is pleaded that such use is an exploitation of the patent within the meaning of schedule 1 of the Act , and that, accordingly, the purchaser will infringe the patent by their use of the product, through the application of at least one image which is visible from the first side of the assembly, but not visible from the opposite side; this being alleged to be the only reasonable use within the meaning of s 117(2)(a) of the Act .
 It is further alleged that the Respondent has, by reason of its supply of the product (which is not a staple commercial product) and its state of mind (being that it had reason to believe that the purchasers of the product would use it in a way which would infringe the patent) itself infringed the patent, pursuant to ss 117(1) and 117 (2)(b) of the Act . 16 The effect of the default in the filing of a defence is that these claims are not contested by the Respondent.
