 Ground 1: Arbitrary and/or capricious action on the part of the Tribunal in making a credibility finding 12 The appellant submits that the Tribunal's finding that his testimony was rehearsed and not a product of his personal experience is not supported.
 If there is, in the sense mentioned, an unacceptable risk that the events occurred or had such character, they are to be taken into account in assessing whether there is a real chance of Convention-related harm to the applicant.
 The appellant contends that, on a real chance test, the Tribunal should have found that the incidents described by the appellant did occur. 51 The appellant submits that it is evident from the Tribunal decision that the Tribunal was not confidently satisfied that the events did not take place.
