 Its directors from the date of its incorporation were Stiven Marin Jakovich and Vjeko Nikola Jakovich. 2 On 11 April 2007 the directors of the company signed a circulating resolution pursuant to s 436A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) appointing Dino Travaglini as voluntary administrator of the company under Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act .
 The resolution of the directors incorporated their opinion that the company was likely to become insolvent at some future time or was already insolvent at that time. 3 On 12 June 2007, at a meeting of creditors of the company, a resolution was passed for it to be wound up and Mr Travaglini be appointed as its liquidator.
 According to his initial review of the company's affairs in his role as administrator, and later as liquidator, he had formed the view that the company should have sufficient funds to discharge its liabilities. 4 According to Mr Travaglini, Mr Jakovich was previously married to one Loretta Jakovich.
 The effect of the variation which he sought was to ratify his appointment as liquidator and to authorise him to exercise all powers and deal with the assets of the company pursuant to Pt 5.4B through to Pt 5.9 of the Corporations Act in respect of winding up the company. 8 There were difficulties getting in touch with Stiven Jakovich.
