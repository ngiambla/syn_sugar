 If the application has not been certified as mentioned in para (4)(a), the Registrar cannot be satisfied that the condition in subs (4) has been satisfied unless the application : (a) includes a statement to the effect that the requirement set out in para (4)(b) has been met; and (b) briefly sets out the grounds on which the Registrar should consider that it has been met. 17 Reading together ss 190A (6) and 190C (4)(b), the logical conclusion is that, unless the Registrar or his delegate is satisfied that the applicant is a member of the native title claim group and is authorised to make the application, and deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the other persons in the native title claim group, the Registrar or his delegate must not accept the claimant application for registration.
 The breadth of the information the Registrar can take into account pursuant to s 190C (4)(b) was recognised by the Full Court in Western Australia v Strickland at 52 18 The decision of the Registrar to accept or reject an application is a purely administrative function, the decision depending upon whether or not such application satisfies the prescribed criteria ( Gudjala People #2 v Native Title Registrar [2007] FCA 1167 at [15] ).
