 The Visy parties contend that such statements were inaccurate, misleading and detrimental to the integrity of the opt out procedure. 5 An example of such comments is found in the publication, "The Weekly Times", in which Mr Slade was quoted as saying on 19 March 2008: 'The ACCC alleges an overcharge of between 8 and 23 per cent ... if it was 10 per cent then being a $2 billion annual market and with the cartel running for five years the amount taken from the Australian economy would be $1 billion. ' The making of this statement is not denied by Mr Slade, who did not appear to give evidence on this application.
 In addition, it is common ground between the parties that the ACCC never made any statement to the above effect. 6 In response to these comments, the solicitors for the Visy parties wrote to Mr Slade on 31 March 2008 and complained of the misleading and inaccurate nature of the statements published in "The Weekly Times".
 CONSIDERATION 12 The Visy parties refer to the Further Amended Statement of Claim and say that the statements of Mr Slade are inaccurate and misleading because they incorrectly attributed to the ACCC a comment that the alleged cartel activity of the Visy parties and the Amcor parties resulted in an overcharge of between 8 and 23 per cent.
