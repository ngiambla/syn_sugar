 This was all material which was not previously available and material upon which the Commission or its delegate could form the requisite state of " satisfaction ". 25 It is thus considered that s 31(4) confers a power to review a decision after a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
 That power was open to be exercised by the Commission by reason of the fact that there was material upon which the Commission by its delegate could be " satisfied " that the evidence previously before the Commission was " false in a material particular ".
 SECTION 31(6): THE " MATTER " 26 Section 31(6)(a) confers a power of review where the " Commission is satisfied " that there is a " matter that affects the payment of a pension " which was not before " the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ". 27 The Applicant concedes that the power conferred by s 31(6) may be exercised after there has been a review by the Tribunal.
 If the " new material " is no more than a repetition of material that was before the decision-maker, it would not be reasonably open to the Commission to be relevantly satisfied that the material " affects the payment of a pension ". 29 The Applicant has variously identified the " matter ".
