 This was all material which was not previously available and material upon which the Commission or its delegate could form the requisite state of " satisfaction ". 25 It is thus considered that s 31(4) confers a power to review a decision after a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
 SECTION 31(6): THE " MATTER " 26 Section 31(6)(a) confers a power of review where the " Commission is satisfied " that there is a " matter that affects the payment of a pension " which was not before " the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ". 27 The Applicant concedes that the power conferred by s 31(6) may be exercised after there has been a review by the Tribunal.
