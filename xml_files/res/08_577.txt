 The evidence shows that sometime after 1 July 2007 (the evidence is not precise as to the date) the ownership in the vessel passed to a company called Dalton Worldwide SA; and also that the name of the vessel has changed from "George T" to "Sea Coral".
 Accordingly, if a writ in rem is issued before any change in the ownership of a ship has occurred, a subsequent change of ownership would provide good cause for renewing the writ unless those who have the conduct of the action have obviously not pursued it with diligence. 4 In my view, those observations are applicable to the circumstances of this case. 5 The second ground relied upon is that the solicitors have acted with diligence in respect of potential service during the previous 12 months.
 The vessel in question is a bulk iron ore carrier, which has in the past, although not in the last year, visited Australian waters and has berthed at Port Hedland and other locations in Australia. 6 I am, therefore, satisfied that the circumstances of this case warrant the amendment of the writ in rem and the extension of the writ in rem.
