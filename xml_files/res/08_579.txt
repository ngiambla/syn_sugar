 The first and second respondents have offered an undertaking to the Court in answer to any extension of interlocutory restraining orders pending trial. 2 The following undertaking has been offered by counsel for the first and second respondents, Mr Horak: The first respondent and second respondent, whether by itself, its officers, employees or agents or otherwise howsoever permanently undertake that they will cease and forever refrain from importing, distributing, offering for sale, selling or otherwise dealing in the course of trade in any goods to which Australian Trade Mark No. 951664 is applied or any sign that is substantially identical with or deceptively similar to the registered trade mark is applied to such goods without the licence, authority or consent of the registered trade mark proprietor. 3 The Court has accepted that undertaking and in reliance upon it finds no basis to extend pending the trial of the action, an interlocutory injunction order against the first or second respondents.
 One of the orders that attracted some controversy is a proposal for an order that the operation of paras 27 and 28 of the search orders made on 18 and 19 March 2008 as against the first respondent in the proceedings, Mr Michael Young, be extended until 7 May 2008. 5 Mr Horak, on behalf of the respondents in the proceeding, has emphasised that there are public policy reasons why those orders ought not to be extended consistent with the formulation of the Federal Court practice note number 24, dealing with Anton Piller orders, which suggests that any period during which the respondent is to be restrained from informing any other person of the existence of the search order should be as short as possible and not extend beyond 4.30 pm on the return date of the order. 6 Mr Horak makes submissions that, in order to extend Order 27, which is in these terms, 'except for the sole purpose of obtaining legal advice, you (Mr Young), must not until 4.30 pm on the return date directly or indirectly inform any person of this proceeding or of the contents of this order or tell any person that a proceeding has been or may be brought against you by the applicant' and order 28, a notice of motion ought to have been filed seeking specifically that relief.
