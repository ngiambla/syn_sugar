 Conversely, if a tested battery's performance was inferior to that of the Varta High Energy battery (i.e. it did not last as long the Varta High Energy battery) that particular test battery was given a figure less than 100%. 12 The respondent tendered evidence of testing of Varta High Energy AA and AAA batteries in comparison with Energizer Max AA and AAA batteries and submitted that such tests demonstrated that the claim that the respondent's batteries lasted as long as applicant's batteries was true for that comparison.
 Central to the applicant's case was the packaging in which the Varta High Energy batteries were offered for sale. 14 There was evidence indicating that often, although not always, multiple packs of the three types of Energizer battery were hung on a display rack on which packs of Varta High Energy batteries were also hung.
 Order that on and from 23 January 2008 the Respondent whether by its servants or agents or otherwise be permanently restrained from making any representation in trade or commerce that or to the effect that Current Varta High Energy AA or AAA Batteries last as long as Energizer or Duracell. 6.
