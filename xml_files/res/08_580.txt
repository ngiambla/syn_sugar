 As to those matters, it is common ground that the amount of $143,309.00 has been paid and fully discharged and Mr Bell, on behalf of the ATO, has said that the ATO would be prepared to issue a letter to Mr Wilkie which confirms simply that fact.
 The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation opposes the application for the adjournment on a number of grounds, but, fundamentally, on the basis that Mr Wilkie, as director, has presided over the company since 1998 and has had the governance of the company during the period during which the company has failed to lodge taxation returns and has failed until relatively recently to discharge tax debts due to the Commonwealth. 10 Secondly, Mr Bell says that the company was insolvent at the moment in time when the order was made on 29 February 2008.
 The Commissioner has been substantially paid. 11 There are steps being taken to try and secure loans to discharge the residual interest of the Commissioner and, on the company's side of the equation, the fundamental asset of the company is a 'rent-roll' which, if the application is proceeded with and lost, then the rent roll will be sold and individuals will be displaced from employment.
