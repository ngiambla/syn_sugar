 Those reasons form part of my reasons for the making of the order terminating the winding up, and I will take those earlier reasons as read. 3 As appears from the earlier reasons, Terraplanet carried on business as a publisher of magazines, graphic design and pre-press service provider, internet web site designer and developer and related businesses.
 The voluntary administration then came to an end and the Liquidators (in their then capacity as administrators) became the liquidators of Terraplanet. 4 After events recounted in the earlier reasons, the position was reached that if the winding up were to be finalised, there would be no distribution to ordinary unsecured creditors, whose claims totalled approximately $1,533,000. 5 Terraplanet received a recapitalisation proposal from Dalgety Capital Pty Ltd (Dalgety), under which Dalgety would inject $1,800,000 cash into Terraplanet in return for shares representing approximately 92.17% of Terraplanet's issued share capital.
 It provided that on completion, Terraplanet would be released from all Claims, that all Claims against it would be extinguished, and that all persons having a Claim were permitted to lodge a proof of debt pursuant to the proposed trust deed. 17 Also annexed to the DOCA was a form of the "Proposal to Recapitalise" of Dalgety which was dated 22 October 2007.
 No more need be said of it, since it has been overtaken by the orders made on 21 December 2007 and the events referred to in the earlier reasons and in these reasons. 18 The Liquidators/Administrators convened a meeting of the shareholders of Terraplanet, which was held on 3 April 2008.
