 Having explored the likely dimensions of discovery with the parties --- it is of no great magnitude --- I do not consider that it is a factor of significance in the exercise of my discretion. 15 I have not been provided with useful information as to the number and significance of witnesses likely to be called by the respondents and the reasons for their being called --- the suggestion is that there will possibly be up to eight persons who may need to be called.
 While I accept that there is evidence of likely prejudice to Mr Parker and Mr Simmonds in respect of the legal practice were both to be absent from it for two weeks, I am not prepared at this stage to now make an order for that reason. 16 I have accordingly decided that I will not at this stage make the orders sought and have set a timetable for the trial of the matter.
