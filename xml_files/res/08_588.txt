 Its purposes include the promotion of the conservation and better management of Australia's native forests and the stimulation and encouragement of public interest in the value and importance of protecting native forests and related environmental issues. 3 Under s 487(3) of the EPBC Act , LFF has standing to bring this proceeding as a person aggrieved by the Minister's decision.
 To make such an order in those circumstances would deprive LFF of its right of access to this Court in circumstances where it qualifies as an aggrieved person pursuant to expanded standing provisions made under s 487(3) of the EPBC Act in litigation which is asserted to be in the public interest.
 Further, a court should be cautious about making an order for security for costs in circumstances where the respondent whose decision is under challenge doesn't seek such an order. 14 The discretion to make a security for costs order is wide and unfettered but must be exercised judicially; see Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 at 3.
