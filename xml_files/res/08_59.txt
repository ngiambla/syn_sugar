 As with Ms Dowling's application, the affidavit of 25 September 2007 and the statement of claim, this document does nothing to delineate the factual foundation for a claim involving a breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , or, for that matter, any other valid claim against the CBA.
 Whilst she has mentioned the sums of $350,000 and $25,000 that were central to the specific allegations that she raised orally with me at the hearing on 17 December 2007, she has not provided any further details as to how either of these incidents involves a valid claim against the CBA.
