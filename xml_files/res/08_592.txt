 The claim for breach of contract alleges that Smurfit breached the terms of the Agreement inter alia by disconnecting the Armacel equipment which was the subject of the Agreement and failing to use its best endeavours to exploit the technology. 5 However, on 5 October 2007, one month before Armacel filed its Application in this Court, Smurfit commenced proceedings in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
 They brought an action for damages in the Dutch Court which held that their only cause of action lay in contract and that the Dutch court was bound to decline jurisdiction because the contract contained a clause under which the parties submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Sudan. 70 The plaintiffs then began an action in the Admiralty Court of England.
