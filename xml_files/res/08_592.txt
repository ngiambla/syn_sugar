 The claim for breach of contract alleges that Smurfit breached the terms of the Agreement inter alia by disconnecting the Armacel equipment which was the subject of the Agreement and failing to use its best endeavours to exploit the technology. 5 However, on 5 October 2007, one month before Armacel filed its Application in this Court, Smurfit commenced proceedings in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
 In those proceedings Smurfit seeks negative declaratory relief that it has no remaining obligations under the Agreement, other than the payment of certain monthly instalments and the return of Armacel's equipment. 6 On 27 December 2007 the US District Court dismissed a motion brought by Armacel for the dismissal of the proceeding on the ground of want of jurisdiction.
 They brought an action for damages in the Dutch Court which held that their only cause of action lay in contract and that the Dutch court was bound to decline jurisdiction because the contract contained a clause under which the parties submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Sudan. 70 The plaintiffs then began an action in the Admiralty Court of England.
 The latter question may raise the application of United States environmental law issues including a complaint filed with the Occupational Health Safety Administration: see Smurfit's Complaint in the US District Court [26]. 113 Moreover, the factual issues concerning Smurfit's decision to cease exploiting the technology centre upon what was, and what was not, done in the United States.
