 Clauses 6.1 and 6.2: These clauses require the Borrower "to redeliver Equivalent Securities in accordance with this Agreement and the terms of the relevant Borrowing Request" and specifically at the call of the Lender.
 Equivalent Securities are defined in cl 22 to be "securities of an identical type, nominal value, description and amount to particular Securities borrowed and such term will include the certificate and other documents of or evidencing title and transfer".
 At that point the shares, because they are identical in number and type to the lent shares (Securities), immediately fall within the definition (and thus assume the character) of Equivalent Securities which, in due course, must be delivered to Beconwood.
 Crucially, there is no provision in the SLA restricting OPS from disposing of the lent shares or requiring OPS to keep on hand at any time specific securities for delivery to Beconwood as Equivalent Securities.
