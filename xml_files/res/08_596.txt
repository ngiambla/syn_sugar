 That Motion was filed in proceedings in which the principal claim for relief is a declaration that a notice issued under s 16(1) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 11 November 2007 is " invalid ". 2 Detailed written submissions have been filed by both the Applicant in support of its Motion and by the First Respondent in respect to the making of any order for further discovery. 3 The principal submission advanced by the First Respondent is that there has already been made available to the Applicant a copy of all of that material which was before the Minister when making his decision in November 2007.
 Whether that is so or not, the assurance that no reliance will be placed upon the November 2007 notice is noted. 6 In those circumstances the Applicant correctly accepts there is no utility in further pursuing his claim for declaratory relief and further accepts that any application for discovery also becomes unnecessary. 7 The issues remaining outstanding are the making of an order dismissing the proceedings and the question as to who should bear the costs of the proceedings.
 It is anticipated at this stage that the appropriate order to be made, insofar as the principal relief is concerned, is an order noting the assurance given by Counsel for the Minister and an order formally dismissing the proceedings.
 The First Respondent to file and serve a Statement of Facts annexing such correspondence as it sees fit and relevant to the question of costs together with an Outline of Submissions as to costs on or before 29 May 2008. 3.
