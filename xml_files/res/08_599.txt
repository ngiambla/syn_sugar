 THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL 8 The Tribunal concluded that three witnesses who gave evidence to the Tribunal following the actual hearing went beyond giving evidence about matters in relation to which they had knowledge, and speculated as to what they thought might happen to the appellants if they returned to Laos.
 The Tribunal found that as the appellants did not make claims about the matters of speculation raised by the witnesses, the matters raised by the witnesses did not require consideration by the Tribunal. 9 In addition, the Tribunal found that the appellant husband was not a credible witness.
 It was argued that the relationship was clearly made out by the appellants having requested the witnesses give evidence before the Tribunal and by the content of the witnesses' evidence, and that that evidence contained information specific to the appellants and made specific claims about the consequences the appellants faced if they were made to return to Laos.
