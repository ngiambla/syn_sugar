 Introduction 1 The applications presently before the Court call for consideration to be given to the 'power of remission' conferred on the respondent by s 227(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the Assessment Act') as it stood on 29 July 2004. 2 Part IV of the Assessment Act made provision for the lodgement of income tax returns and the making of assessments of taxable income and the tax payable thereon. 3 Under s 170(1) of the Assessment Act the Commissioner was empowered to amend any assessment.
 The Commissioner did not remit any of the additional tax under s 227(3) of the ITAA 1936 (the Remission Decision ). ' 14 Were the Commissioner's contention correct, a decision not to remit any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant would not be a decision of an administrative character which was amenable to review under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act'), since decisions to which that Act applied did not include 'a decision included in any of the classes of decisions set out in Schedule 1' (see the definition of 'decision to which this Act applies' in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act).
 The applicant claims that the respondent's failure to consider the package of information constitutes an arguable case of bad faith or an arguable case of a breach of s 166 of the [Assessment] Act or an arguable case of a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and, in particular, the hearing rule.

 This amendment resulted from a disallowance of the applicant's claimed deduction from his assessable income of $5 million by way of contribution to, I assume, the 'Bonnell No. 2 Superannuation Fund'; (b) by s 226K of the Assessment Act, the applicant became liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 25% of the amount of the tax shortfall.
