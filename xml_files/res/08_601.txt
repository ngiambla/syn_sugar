 Hansen then proposed that in view of these actions of Bickfords, the costs order should be that Bickfords pays 30% of Hansen's costs of the proceeding. 6 Bickfords accepts that costs would normally follow the event, but argues that such order would require the Registrar in taxation to reconsider all the evidence and submissions to determine which were attributable to the cross-claim, which would involve unnecessary expense. 7 In view of the fact that Bickfords characterises the Hansen claim (which failed) as essentially the main claim, Bickfords therefore proposed the following orders: 1.
 Each party sought to establish its own reputation on the evidence. 10 The conclusion I reached was as follows: I have decided that neither Hansen nor Bickfords has established upon the evidence before the Court the reputation required by law to succeed in their respective claims, and I propose to dismiss the claim and cross-claim making no restraining orders. ...
 Whilst I appreciate that I need not apportion with any degree of precision, I must have some basis for making an apportionment and a clear identification of issues. 16 In view of my reasons above, it seems appropriate that each party bear its own costs. 17 The question then arises as to whether there should be any qualification of this approach to justify an award of costs in favour of Hansen for the reasons suggested by Hansen, namely those based on Bickfords' failure to admit facts set out in the notice to admit and the substantial number of unsuccessful objections taken by Bickfords.
