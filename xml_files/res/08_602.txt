 Thereafter, Mr Etl did not oppose the making of the orders made by his Honour on 17 December 2007. 2 There is before the Court a draft notice of appeal which has been filed by Mr Etl.
 The ground is that his Honour had not exercised his discretion judicially and had done so "in a manner that caused a miscarriage of justice in the affirming of the sequestration order made against the Appellant. " 3 As I understand it, the appeal is directed to the refusal of the adjournment.
 I take that view because of what appears in the draft notice of appeal and by reason of the fact that the orders that were made after the adjournment application was refused were not opposed. 4 Mr Etl appeared in person before me on 30 April 2008 and made a strong plea for, in substance, a further adjournment of the proceeding so that he could pursue various lines of inquiry which, as I understood him, were directed towards establishing that the sequestration order made against him by the Registrar in September last year was obtained as a result of conduct by the parties seeking that order which he was disposed to characterise as criminal, fraudulent and improper.
