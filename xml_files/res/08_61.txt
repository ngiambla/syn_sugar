 In the present case, the Court must be satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between Ox Operations and LMPD about the existence or amount of the debt to which the demand relates: s 459H(1)(a) of the Act .
 In my view, other than mere assertion or speculation, there is nothing to suggest that transactions placed into the loan account in the name of Ox Operations in LMPD's general ledger in the manner described above (see [33]) was anything other than appropriate.
