 In Mr Smallwood's oral evidence, he explained that the Commonwealth Bank is not his normal banker but by reason of a particular introduction, he was able to make an approach to the Commonwealth Bank and complete a loan application form which was sent to a gentleman called 'James', who is an officer of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney. 4 Mr Smallwood had a conversation this gentleman called James recently and sent some further information on behalf of the trustee of the trust and, no doubt, other financial information to the Commonwealth Bank.
 The present debt due to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation is approximately $120,000 which would result in a balance surplus proceeds of $12,000, assuming finance is obtained and those contracts settle so as to realise the value of the sale price in each case. 6 A further matter arises in relation to a recent GST audit which was conducted, involving transactions associated with the defendant.
 I am not prepared to rely upon the evidence in relation to the finance application to the Commonwealth Bank. 8 There is no affidavit which deposes in detail to the chronology or sequence of conversations between Mr Smallwood and the Commonwealth Bank, nor the loan application documents, nor copies of materials sent to the Commonwealth Bank, nor any information in relation to the officer of the Commonwealth Bank or the branch, and in particular, no specificity is given about the gentleman with whom Mr Smallwood has been dealing.
