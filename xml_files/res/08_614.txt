 In particular, it should be noted that the term " information " in s 424A(1) does not extend to " the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence ": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616.
 Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ there held: [18] ... if the reason why the tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting "information" within the meaning of para (a) of s 424A(1).
 In the present proceedings and in the absence of the alleged failure to " comply with s424A " being identified by the Appellant, or the " information " to which he refers in the first Ground of Appeal being identified, little further content can be given to this aspect of the first Ground of Appeal.
 The Tribunal has not accepted that the applicant has given credible evidence in relation to his claims to fear harm for reasons of his religion and, in such circumstances, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant's business has been be [sic] targeted and he has been prevented from operating a successful business for reasons of his religion.
