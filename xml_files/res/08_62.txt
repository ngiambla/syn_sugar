 For present purposes it is sufficient to note that the Application sought damages of $12.5 million from the respondent 'AS A RESULT OF PERSONAL INJURY/DAMAGE TO ROBERT HINE AND HIS FUTURE EARNING CAPACITY AND CPR PROPERTY PTY LTD'. 6 The Application referred to claims under various provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( ' Trade Practices Act ' ), claims under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) and claims identified as 'STATEMENT OF CLAIM --- DIRECT V INDIRECT TORTS'. 7 The Statement of Claim provided something of a narrative of Mr Hine's grievances in respect of his exclusion from government contracts.
 In paragraph 9 it included a sentence: 'The Department of Housing, tortuously (sic) interfered with a sub contractor commercially defamed Robert Hine and CPR PROPERTY PTY LTD and breached the Trade Practices Act and Fair Trading Act . ' The Statement of Claim concluded with the words 'The applicant claims the relief specified in the application', before a disclosure that the pleading had been prepared by 'ROBERT HINE AND CPR PROPERTY PTY LTD'. 8 On 10 May 2007 leave was granted to the applicants to file and serve an Amended Application and an Amended Statement of Claim on or before 6 June 2007.
 On 28 June 2007 I ordered that the name of the first respondent be changed from 'The Land and Housing Corporation' to 'New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation' and also ordered that 'State of New South Wales' be added as a second respondent. 9 Once again the Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim sought relief for the applicants by way of damages in the sum of $12.5 million.
 The Respondent committed the tort of unlawful interference with the Applicant and in doing so breached sections 46(1), (a), (b) and (c) of the Trade Practices Act (1974) (Cth). ' 10 It was at this stage that Mr Lancaster, of counsel, came into the matter to assist the applicants pro bono.
 The claims made in the Further Amended Application ("FAA") and the Further Amended Statement of Claim ("FASC"), each filed on 30 October 2007, allege: (a) causes of action in tort, that is, breach of duty to take care (paras 35-38 FASC), negligent misstatement (paras 39-47 and 48-56 FASC) and interference with contract (paras 57-66); and (b) causes of action for damages under ss 42 , 43 and 68 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). ' Mr Lancaster's submissions continued: '9.
 Those pleadings included bona fide claims made under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). ' 11 Mr Tyndall of counsel, for the respondents, submits that the pleadings which claimed relief under the Trade Practices Act did not deal with a 'matter' which was a justiciable controversy.
 Mr Tyndall does not submit that the references to the Trade Practices Act in the original Application, the original Statement of Claim, the Amended Application and the Amended Statement of Claim were colourable in the sense that they were made for the improper purpose of 'fabricating' jurisdiction. 12 In the circumstances, the weight of authority seems to me to be against the respondent's case on the present motion. 13 Section 76(ii) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia ('the Constitution ') provides: '76.
 The Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter --- ... (ii. ) Arising under any laws made by the Parliament: ...' 14 By s 77 of the Constitution , it was open to the Parliament to make laws with respect to such matters, defining the jurisdiction of any federal court other than the High Court.
 This court's jurisdiction has been defined by the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), which was enacted in accordance with s 77(i) of the Constitution . 15 In his learned article on 'Federal jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia in 2002' (2002) 23 ABR 29, Allsop J said, at 34-35 under the heading 'Matter': '...
 If a federal matter is raised on the pleading federal jurisdiction is exercised, notwithstanding that the court finds it unnecessary to decide the federal question because the case can be disposed of on other grounds. ' 17 Once a matter has attracted federal jurisdiction, it does not cease to be within the jurisdiction of this court if: (a) the federal question is decided adversely; (b) the federal question is struck out; (c) it is found not necessary to decide the federal question; or (d) the federal part of the matter is settled (see Beck v Spalla [2005] FCAFC 82 ; (2005) 142 FCR 555 at 560 [25] --- [26]). 18 In my opinion there was clearly a justiciable controversy raised by the proceedings as instituted by Mr Hine and CPR Property Pty Limited at least once the applicants identified appropriate respondents which were juristic animals.
 There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Hine had any understanding that claims brought by him, under the Trade Practices Act sections that he relied upon, would be hopeless or would prove to be hopeless. 19 The cases make it clear that federal jurisdiction will not be attracted where the federal claim is 'colourable' (see Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1987) 18 FCR 212 at 219; Unilan Holdings Pty Limited v Kerin (1993) 44 FCR 481 and Beck v Spalla at 560 [26]).
 In Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation Bowen CJ, Morling and Beaumont JJ said at 219: 'The position may have been different if the claims under the Act [referring to the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)] had been "colourable" in the sense that they were made for the improper purpose of "fabricating" jurisdiction: see PH Lane, Lane's Commentary on the Australian Constitution (1986), pp 367-368 and the cases there cited. ' 20 In the foregoing circumstances I am of the opinion that the Further Amended Notice of Motion filed 19 November 2007 should be dismissed.
