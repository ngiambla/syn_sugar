 The meeting has been convened but it was adjourned until 9 May 2008, which was the longest period permitted by the Act. 2 The circumstances in which the application is made are set out in the affidavit of Mr John Vouris sworn 30 April 2008.
 The circumstances in which the appointment was made are set out in [4] of Mr Vouris's affidavit and I need not repeat them. 4 The investigations made by the administrators indicate that the company has a very substantial surplus of assets over liabilities.
 The administrators have convened information meetings for members to discuss the merits of the two amalgamation proposals. 10 In anticipation of the possible amalgamation with the Jets, the administrators and the Jets have negotiated draft documentation including a Memorandum of Understanding and a Deed of Amalgamation.
 That is a reason which underlies the application for the power to further adjourn the meeting to 24 June 2008. 12 Thus the effect of the application is that the administrators seek an order to permit a further adjournment of the second meeting of creditors to 24 June 2008.
