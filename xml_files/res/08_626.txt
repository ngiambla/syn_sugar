 As to [SZJLH's] oral account of his reasons for leaving India, I accept that he was the owner of a business which specialised in wedding decorations, and that between 2004 and 2006 a competitor tried to drive him out of business.
 The Tribunal also made the following finding: Further, much of his evidence as to when attacks on him and his family occurred was vague and internally contradictory and for that reason I have some doubt that he was harmed at all in 2005.
