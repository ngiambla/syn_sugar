 The business of pSivida involves the development of pharmaceutical products for targeted and controlled drug delivery for local and international clients. 2 The scheme is intended to effect a change of pSivida's domicile from Western Australia to Delaware in the United States of America, while maintaining listings on the ASX, NASDAQ and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
 Each CDI will represent an interest in one fully paid share of the common stock in New pSivida. 4 The scheme will also result in the issue of New pSivida shares to the ADS Depository for distribution to the ADS holders.
 The undertaking is being transferred to persons who are not outsiders so that substantially the same business will be carried on by substantially the same persons who previously conducted the business. 14 I have been provided with a helpful written outline of pSivida Ltd's submissions.
