 The business of pSivida involves the development of pharmaceutical products for targeted and controlled drug delivery for local and international clients. 2 The scheme is intended to effect a change of pSivida's domicile from Western Australia to Delaware in the United States of America, while maintaining listings on the ASX, NASDAQ and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
 The undertaking is being transferred to persons who are not outsiders so that substantially the same business will be carried on by substantially the same persons who previously conducted the business. 14 I have been provided with a helpful written outline of pSivida Ltd's submissions.
