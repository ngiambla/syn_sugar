 The applicants (as cross-respondents), in their notice of motion dated 26 November 2007, sought an order that the cross-claimants' notices of motion and the attached pleadings be removed from the Court file.
 I further ordered that the cross-claimants pay the applicants' costs thrown away in dealing with the cross-claimants' notices of motion dated 15 November, 22 November 2007 and 28 November 2007.
 Those costs were the costs of the hearing and, in particular, the applicants'/cross-respondents' costs occasioned by the cross-claimants' desire yet again to amend their cross-claim. 20 The applicants press their claim for their costs of these notices of motion to be paid on an indemnity basis.
