 Given the request that the Affidavit not be made available to the other parties, it was not read and as events unfolded on 8 February 2008 it was not necessary to do so. 11 On 8 February 2008 the Court was informed that Mr Sharples sought to discontinue the proceedings provided that he was not thereby exposed to an order for the payment of costs.
 The Respondents were content to embrace that proposal. 12 Accordingly, there were before the Court on 8 February three matters for consideration, namely: 1. the making of orders to give effect to the proposal for Mr Sharples to discontinue the proceedings; 2. the request for an order of referral pursuant to O 80; and 3. the future conduct of the proceedings given the orders previously made on 11 December 2007 against The Fishing Party.
 Although the definition of the term " proceeding " is further defined by O 4, r 4, and is a " very wide definition " ( Fiorentino v Irons (1997) 79 FCR 327 at 330), the width of the definition would not embrace a " proceeding " which the Rules expressly prohibit being " commenced ", at least in the manner pursued to date by the Second Applicant. 23 No power to make a referral exists prior to the commencement of proceedings, be it at the request of an individual or a corporation, whether or not represented by a solicitor.
 Thus, even if the proceedings had been properly " commenced " by The Fishing Party, or even had the request been made by the First Applicant, it would have been refused. 25 Order 80, r 1(2) states that the purpose of O 80 is to: ... facilitate, where it is in the interests of the administration of justice, the provision of legal assistance to litigants who are otherwise unable to obtain assistance.
