 At the hearing of this application, I made an interim order that the information remain confidential until the determination of this application. 3 The application by the Minister is for an order that the reasons, transcript and written submissions relating to the appeal not be published until after the determination of any special leave application before the High Court.
 It is also said that publication may have an adverse impact on any persons giving information to the Minister to enable him to carry out those functions. 4 Although counsel for the appellant opposes the application, he is unable to identify any significant prejudice his client might suffer if the application is granted.
 However, he draws the Court's attention to the important public interest in transparent justice, and notes that the Full Court, in its reasons for judgment, expressly found that the information should not be treated as confidential. 5 Notwithstanding the submissions advanced by counsel for the appellant, I consider that, in the absence of any identified prejudice to the appellant, it is appropriate that the information be treated as confidential until the determination by the High Court of any application for special leave to appeal, or until the expiry of 28 days from the date of the judgment, or until any decision is made not to seek a special leave to appeal.
