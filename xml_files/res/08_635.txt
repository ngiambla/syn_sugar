 The appellant replied that he had a membership card "back home, but I haven't got it with me, I could send for it if it's required".
 The tribunal member informed the appellant that it was up to him what information he wished to submit in support of his application.
 That you could not provide clear and consistent evidence about when you joined Tauhid Jamaad leads the Tribunal to doubt that you ever became a member of the organisation. 7 The other heading was "Knowledge of Political Matters".
 That is, he failed to provide any information to the tribunal regarding his membership of either organisation. 11 In the result therefore the tribunal, albeit belatedly, did provide the appellant with an opportunity to provide the information he had wanted to submit.
