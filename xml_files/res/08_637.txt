 The solicitors for the insurer successfully argued in the Supreme Court that the damages sought by Mr Lovell were a provable debt pursuant to s 82(2) of the Act despite being an unliquidated sum and the claim should therefore be stayed pursuant to s 58(3) of the Act.
 It was therefore not provable in the defendant's bankruptcy and the plaintiff was not required to obtain leave from the Federal Court of Australia before pursuing it.
