 Mr Lovell accepts that a contractual claim is open but says that he has elected to pursue the claim by way of negligence only rather than for breach of contract. 10 As all legal practitioners are required to do, Mr Penkin held compulsory professional indemnity insurance in respect of claims such as that brought by Mr Lovell.
 The solicitors for the insurer successfully argued in the Supreme Court that the damages sought by Mr Lovell were a provable debt pursuant to s 82(2) of the Act despite being an unliquidated sum and the claim should therefore be stayed pursuant to s 58(3) of the Act.
 It was therefore not provable in the defendant's bankruptcy and the plaintiff was not required to obtain leave from the Federal Court of Australia before pursuing it. (footnotes omitted) 20 The High Court came to consider Aliferis [2000] VSCA 123 ; 179 ALR 477 in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 227 CLR 234.
