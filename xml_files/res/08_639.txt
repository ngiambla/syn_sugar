 PASSING OFF AND MISLEADING CONDUCT CLAIM 4 Ricegrowers alleges that there is a substantial similarity between the two flavoured rice cakes and one flavoured corn cakes products it sells and three flavoured corn cakes products Real Foods sells.
 Ricegrowers began marketing a SunRice sundried tomato and basil flavoured rice cake in a similar get-up to the original thin sour cream and chives rice cake get-up, except that the packaging was predominantly two tones of red.
 I am satisfied that there was no real possibility of the ordinary reasonable consumer being mislead or deceived or being confused by the get-up or packaging of the cheese flavoured and salt and vinegar flavoured "Corn Thins" products.
