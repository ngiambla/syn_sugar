 The objective of the proposed scheme is to effect a merger between Hostworks and Broadcast Australia Pty Ltd (Broadcast Australia) whereby, if the proposed scheme is approved, Hostworks will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Broadcast Australia. 2 Hostworks' business is managing the availability, performance and running costs of business applications.
 I will also refer to that feature of the proposed scheme in more detail later in these reasons. 10 The Scheme Booklet to be sent to the members of Hostworks includes copies of the Implementation Agreement, the proposed scheme, the Deed Poll, notice of the proposed meeting and an independent expert's report accompanying the detailed explanatory statement provided by the independent directors of Hostworks.
 During the same period, under the "no-talk" provision, Hostworks is to ensure that neither it nor its representatives negotiates with any persons in relation to, or which might reasonably be expected to lead to, a competing transaction, even if it was not solicited or initiated by Hostworks in any way.
