 In particular, the phrases which are in dispute are: (i) "opening extending therethrough" in claim 1 of Jones II or "opening extending through said leg" in claim 51 of Jones II; (ii) "digging edge" in claims 1 and 51 of Jones II; and (iii) "a rigid lock received into said opening" in claims 1 and 51 of Jones II or "a lock received into the opening" in claim 1 of Jones III.
 Further and in the alternative, the respondents submit that, even if claim 1 of Jones III does not require the whole of the lock to be received within the first and second bearing surfaces, then at least the essential parts of the lock must be received between those two surfaces.
 In relation to this alternative construction of the claim, the respondents refer to Mr Alden's acceptance of the proposition that important components of the lock in the respondents' product (the nut, bolt, keeper plates, spring washer and nut washer) are not received between the two relevant bearing surfaces.
 He also stated that the looseness in Toplok was not a "design flaw" because that wear assembly was expressly designed to permit looseness, a design characteristic which could be tolerated in a shroud and which carried the advantage of being relatively cheap and simple to manufacture.
