 The State argued that it was entitled to an order for the costs of that exercise under s 85A(2) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), or alternatively under the general power of the Court to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 That material was necessary to enable the parties and the Court to take steps to prepare for the hearing at which the evidence was to be preserved. 14 On 19 July 2007 the State filed a notice of motion, supporting affidavit and submissions in accordance with the orders I had made for that purpose.
 He argued that the jurisdiction to award costs under s 85A should be only be exercised in circumstances where there were special or unusual features of the case, or where there had been conduct in the nature of an abuse of process, improper purpose, contempt or unreasonableness.
 In my opinion the present application for costs warrants recognition that expense over and above that which would ordinarily be incurred in these proceedings has been visited upon the State by the unreasonable way in which the Birri Gubba People have conducted the issue of preservation of evidence.
