 AOS failed to file any such objections to affidavit evidence relied on by Ms Byrne at a time when it was not in voluntary administration and when its solicitors were still acting for it.
 In about January 2004, OWS received a Request for Assistance Form from Ms Eghnatios concerning underpayments of wages. 11 Mr Barker gave evidence that he spoke with Mr Richard Adamczyk of Frenkel Partners, who then acted for AOS, on 6 October 2006.
 The solicitor for AOS received that affidavit on 8 September 2006, in advance of the trial which was due to commence on 16 October 2006 before Magistrate Hawkins, and forwarded a copy of it to AOS. 14 On 5 October 2006, Ms Eghnatios' team leader, Mr George Omar, told her that she was being transferred to the Werribee store with effect from 9 October 2006.
