 When delivering judgment in the principal proceeding in which I dismissed Mr Duncan's application: see Duncan v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2008] FCA 56 ; (2008) 100 ALD 292 ; I ventured to suggest that this may be an appropriate matter in which to make no order as to costs.
 It is not unfair to say that Mr Duncan's requests and in the event this litigation have been instrumental in leading Centrelink to an understanding of its responsibilities under the two Acts and of its compliance obligations.
 I equally am not satisfied that, if the respondent CEO had complied with the statutory obligations imposed by s 13(3) of the AD(JR) Act in responding to Mr Duncan's requests, Mr Duncan would not have desisted from taking the litigious course that he did even though it was as I found ultimately doomed.
