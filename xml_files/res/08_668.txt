 This application led to the first decision; it has no direct relevance to the second decision and since that is the effective or operative decision, in the absence of any particularisation of the grounds that were not considered and their relevance to the second decision, this ground must be rejected. (ii) The Deputy Commissioner accepted that the applicant had medical reasons for not complying with all of her income tax obligations but ignored that matter in making the decision.
 This ground was not pressed in either written or oral submissions and neither limb has any substantive basis. 25 Ground number 5 in the further amended application, in reliance on the grounds referred to in [23] above, seeks orders that a writ of certiorari be issued to the Deputy Commissioner to quash the first decision or, alternatively, the second decision and that a writ of mandamus be issued to the Deputy Commissioner to require the applicant's application for remission of GIC pursuant to s 8AAG of the TAA be determined according to law. 26 This was particularised on two bases: (1) That the applicant should have been given an opportunity to comment on the assertions of fact stated in the second and further bullet points on the second page of the letter dated 31 October 2006.
 Accordingly, the applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to require the Deputy Commissioner to consider the application contained in her letter dated 1 November 2006. 27 The Deputy Commissioner was under no obligation, statutory or otherwise, to afford the applicant an opportunity to comment on the assertions of fact stated in those parts of the Deputy Commissioner's letter of 31 October 2006 identified in para (1) of the particulars, prior to the Deputy Commissioner sending that letter; and his failure to do so does not involve the applicant being denied natural justice.
 By that I do not mean that such points are confined exclusively to such process of correction; but a number are. 29 The Deputy Commissioner has not responded to this further request and there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that he had reconsidered the applicant's application for remission of GIC or, if he had, whether he had made a decision in respect of it.
