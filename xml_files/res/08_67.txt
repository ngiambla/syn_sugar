 The Minister sought orders that the application for leave to appeal be granted, the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court be set aside and the matter be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court.
 In written submissions in support of the motion counsel for the Minister advised the Court that, on reflection, the Minister's legal advisers had come to the view that the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court was "clearly correct".
 The potential exists for a further layer of complexity to be added: on 8 February 2008 Gleeson CJ and Crennan J granted the Minister leave to appeal to the High Court from the Full Court's decision in SZKKC : see High Court S380 of 2007. 9 In these circumstances I consider that the applicant should have leave to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court.
