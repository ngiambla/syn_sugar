 BLL was asked to "fix it now" and it made its decision to terminate and Little put in train the processes that would lead to that decision being communicated to Luketic.
 I also am satisfied, despite Hensley's reservation about the matter, that he told Noonan that Bernmar would be gone from the site but time for this was needed.
 In any event this was already a requirement of BLL's contract with Bernmar. (ii) The CFMEU and its officers, as BLL well knew, were not opposed to the engagement of subcontractors.
