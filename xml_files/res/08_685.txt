 While there is considerable evidence of widespread arrests by the government, the Tribunal finds no evidence before it as to why the applicant, who has been absent from Bangladesh for over six years, would be targeted by the caretaker government.
 The appellant's central point before Federal Magistrate Cameron was that the Guidance Note pre-dated the installation of the emergency caretaker government in Bangladesh and thus practical constraints upon the appellant's potential relocation within Bangladesh had not been considered by the Tribunal.
 Federal Magistrate Cameron concluded that because the Tribunal had concluded that the appellant would not be 'targeted' by the caretaker government, that phrase must be understood to mean that the change of government would have no impact on the appellant's ability to relocate within Bangladesh.
