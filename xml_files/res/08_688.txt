 While the Tribunal accepted that the appellant was required to undertake an anger management course, and give evidence in various court cases, it found that these circumstances did not affect his enrolment as they did not prevent him from enrolling in a registered course.
 His Honour noted that the term "exceptional circumstances" is an ordinary term without specific definitions that the Tribunal could have misapplied. 8 After examining the contents of the psychological report, his Honour found that the Tribunal's failure to refer to the report in detail did not establish jurisdictional error.
 The report had been prepared to provide supporting evidence for a claim by the appellant for an award, by the Victorian Crimes Compensation Tribunal, of damages for injuries sustained by the appellant in the course of an assault which had occurred in January 2005.
 In the circumstances, it does not appear to me to be established that the failure to refer to the psychological report in more detail shows a jurisdictional error on the part of the tribunal.
