 BACKGROUND 1 This purports to be an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on 3 March 2008 dismissing an application for reinstatement of an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") dated 23 February 2007 (see: MZXPW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 480).
 FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT 6 On 13 April 2007 the appellant filed an application seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. 7 The appellant sought an adjournment of the hearing in a letter sent to the Court via facsimile transmission.
 The Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal had, at the appellant's request, given the appellant an extension of time to provide such additional evidence to it. 11 The appellant also claimed that the Tribunal was effectively biased.
 The appellant claimed he was not given sufficient time to "submit all the documents which [he] had", and he restated his claim of persecution. 14 When the appeal was called on in this Court this morning the appellant was not present.
