 The Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal had, at the appellant's request, given the appellant an extension of time to provide such additional evidence to it. 11 The appellant also claimed that the Tribunal was effectively biased.
 The appellant claimed he was not given sufficient time to "submit all the documents which [he] had", and he restated his claim of persecution. 14 When the appeal was called on in this Court this morning the appellant was not present.
