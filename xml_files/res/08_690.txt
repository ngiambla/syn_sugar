 The appellant understood the Federal Magistrate's reasons. 16 The appellant had received assistance from legal aid personnel in preparing his notice of appeal and also had assistance in preparing submissions which were filed in support of the appeal.
 The second ground appearing in the notice of appeal reads: "The Tribunal decision of not believing that (sic) I had an affair with a Muslim girl was contrary to the delegate (sic) decision and was not supported by evidence.
 The learned magistrate erred in holding with (sic) the Tribunal at this point. " The reason that the Tribunal rejected the evidence of the appellant relating to the alleged affair was that the evidence given by the appellant was vague and inconsistent and had been contradicted in material respects by his mother's evidence.
