 In view of the above, I formally apply for a TPD Benefit from the MMA Staff Superannuation Fund on the grounds found in Mr Beer's letter to me, dated 16 March 1994, and Senator Grant Chapman's letter to Mr Tom Phillips dated 19 October 2005.
 The single question raised by the pleading is whether, having regard to the circumstances of Mr Kowalski's cessation of employment by MMAL on 16 March 1994 and the terms of the Trust Deed and its Schedule C, the pleading sufficiently discloses a reasonably arguable cause of action against MMA Super --- hence AMP Super --- in respect of its administration of the fund vis--vis Mr Kowalski.
 I find it difficult to understand why the entrenchment of such important rights against review is so usual, and why this kind of arrangement is so commonly found acceptable to employees in view of the economic significance of such decisions and the economic function of superannuation, not well represented in the terms of the documents, as a contracted employment benefit for which value is given.
