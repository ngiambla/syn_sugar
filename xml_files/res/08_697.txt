 The costs owed to Peoplebank outlined in the 3 November 2006 costs order are still owed, despite the order that they be taxed and payable forthwith.
 This is said to be due to the costs already owed to Peoplebank, the security Cytel has provided to the Court and the asset preservation order made against Cytel.
 However, Peoplebank incurred further costs to obtain the benefit of an order already made, as the costs due to Peoplebank under the 3 November 2006 costs order remain unpaid.
