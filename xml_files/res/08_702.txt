 INTRODUCTION 1 Belinda Iliff was the marketing manager for Sterling Commerce (Australia) Pty Ltd (Sterling Commerce), a software and solutions company and a member of the global Sterling Group of companies.
 For example, in Ms Iliff's written submissions before the Federal Magistrate, under the heading 'Sex Discrimination Claim', the broad allegation was made that Sterling Commerce discriminated against Ms Iliff in not returning her to her previous position or the asserted new position.
 Sterling Commerce submitted that costs should have followed the event and that the matters relied upon by his Honour to justify an order that Sterling Commerce pay 80% of Ms Iliff's costs of the proceeding did not constitute special circumstances. 38 This alternative argument also fails.
 ISSUE 4 --- DISCRIMINATION CLAIM MADE OUT (GROUNDS 1 AND 2) 40 Burchardt FM found that Sterling Commerce had not discriminated against Ms Iliff on the grounds of maternity leave or parenthood.
