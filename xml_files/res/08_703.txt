 Section 251JA(1)(a) and (2) are in the following terms: Original registration of tax agents (1) The Board shall register the applicant as a tax agent if the applicant satisfies the Board that: (a) if the applicant is a natural person: (i) the applicant is a fit and proper person to prepare income tax returns and transact business on behalf of taxpayers in income tax matters; and (ii) the applicant is not an undischarged bankrupt; ... (2) The Board shall refuse to register the applicant in any other case. ...
 Thus the characteristics required to show fitness as a tax agent were expressed by Davies J in Re Su and Tax Agents' Board, South Australia (1982) 82 ATC 2484 at 4286 as requiring that person to be: ... a person of good reputation, has a proper knowledge of taxation laws, is able to prepare income tax returns competently and is able to deal competently with any queries which may be raised by officers of the Taxation Department.
 The asserted misconstruction of the meaning and effect of the phrase "fit and proper person to prepare income tax returns and transact business on behalf of taxpayers in income tax matters" 37 The essence of the argument of the applicant was that the AAT erred by looking at questions of honesty and integrity alone, without linking them to any asserted incompetence with respect to the preparation of income tax returns.
