 A letter of the same date was then sent to the now Appellants communicating that decision. 3 On 28 August 2006 they applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of the delegate's decision.
 The Tribunal concluded that the application for review had been filed outside the time period prescribed by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) and concluded that it did not have jurisdiction. 4 The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking review of the decision of the Tribunal: SZJMY v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FMCA 105. 5 The Appellants now appeal to this Court.
 The Appellants appeared before this Court unrepresented, albeit with the benefit of an interpreter. 6 It is considered that the learned Federal Magistrate was correct in concluding that the non-compliance with the time limits within which an application must be made to the Tribunal deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction.
 Section 494B provides for the methods by which notice of a decision may be given by the Minister to an applicant and includes the giving of notice by means of prepaid post to the last address for service or the last residential address provided to the Minister: s 494B(4).
