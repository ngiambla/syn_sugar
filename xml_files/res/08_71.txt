 BUCHANAN J: 1 By a notice of motion filed on 10 January 2008 the applicant appears to seek the reinstatement, under s 25(2B)(bc) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), of an appeal to this Court which was dismissed by a judge of the Court on 31 October 2007 when he did not appear at the hearing of the appeal.
 His appeal to this Court was dismissed on 31 October 2007 but he was at the same time granted leave to apply on or before 30 December 2007 to vary or discharge the order dismissing his appeal.
 No explanation was given for the failure to apply to vary or discharge the order of 31 October 2007 by the date specified in that order. 9 Although the notice of motion was itself liable to be dismissed for the non-appearance of the applicant it was better, in my view, to dismiss it for lack of merit.
