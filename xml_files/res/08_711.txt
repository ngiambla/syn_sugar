 The respondent identified these matters as: (a) abandonment and replacement of the first two expert reports prepared by Dr Arnold McLean on the fourth day of the trial; and (b) failure to disclose the critical FORS raw data until the fifth day of the trial.
 Rather, they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred, as a normal costs order could not be expected to do, when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs. 7 A perusal of other cases decided in this Court, including in recent times, shows that these principles are regularly applied.
 A good deal of this time and effort turned out to be wasted when the applicants stated their final position. 13 The applicants pointed out that courts regularly express a preference for the evidence of one witness over another, without awarding indemnity costs.
 What justifies the award of indemnity costs is their late abandonment of the reports, the first and longest of which suffered from the defects to which I have referred. 14 The respondent also submitted that the applicants' failure to disclose the FORS raw data until the fifth day of the trial should attract an award of indemnity costs.
