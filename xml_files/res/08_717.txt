 However, in SZDGN v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1543 at [9] Lindgren J correctly concluded that " there is no rule providing for a time limit for the seeking of leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the FMCA ".
 His Honour further concluded that " there is an implied time limit of 21 days after the date of the interlocutory judgment ". 9 No question arises in the present Application as to whether it was filed within time; the question is whether leave should be granted or refused.
 Considerations relevant to the exercise of that discretion are: (i) whether in all the circumstances, the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt as to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court; and (ii) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision were wrong.
