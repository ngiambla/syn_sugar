 Under this paragraph, Hanne pleads that each of it and group members and/or their professional advisers who read the prospectus and/or the 27 August 2004 announcement and/or the 27 October 2004 Announcement relied on the truth or reasonableness of the representations in deciding to acquire or hold shares in Village Life. 12 Village Life contends that [31] is obscure because it does not plead that Hanne in fact read the prospectus or the two statements.
 Further or in the alternative, each of the Applicant and Group Members and/or their professional advisers who read the Express Prospectus Representations and/or the 27 August Announcement and/or 27 October 2004 Announcement: (a) Believed the truth of what they read; or (b) Believed that the representations were made on reasonable grounds; and (c) Relied on the truth or the reasonableness of the representations in deciding to acquire or retain interests in shares in Village Life. 32.
 But that would usually be where the notice, or a subpoena, would be expected to produce documents that have at least potential relevance to the issues in the case: see P Dawson at [31]. 53 Here, the difficulty which arises is that the issues are not defined because the pleading is too general to enable that to occur.
