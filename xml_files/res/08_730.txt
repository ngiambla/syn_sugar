 The said products and services were promoted and supplied by the respondent to its members and to prospective members as membership services to facilitate the ability of any such member, or prospective member, to improve the respective member's profitability and business efficiency, by facilitating the ability of any such member or prospective member: (a) to assess the credit worthiness of a member's own consumers (including, inter alia, the applicant or other respective group member), and (b) to assist any such member to recover debts and to collect disputed debts from a member's own consumers efficiently and cost effectively. 7.
 The respondent knew, or should have known, that incorrect credit worthiness information about any particular customer of a member of the respondent which was supplied by the respondent (with the consumer's permission) in any of the respondent's credit reports to such member, would more probably than not adversely impact on whether a member would offer credit facilities to a member's own consumers (including, inter alia, the applicant and each other respective group member). 12.
 The data, information and/or representations supplied by the respondent in its credit reports referred to in paras. 2(d) and 15 above were false and misleading and were supplied by the respondent to various subscribers of the respondent in breach of the respondent's respective duties of reasonable skill and care to the applicant and each of the other respective group members.
