 The sale in Canberra, which was confined to manchester products (at least so far as the alleged contravening conduct is concerned) took place in July 2005. 7 Terania and ARE conducted the sales in Darwin, involving both rugs and manchester products, by promoting them in a series of television advertisements which comprised one or more of three groups of representations.
 Consequently, in respect of those extensive representations also, I find that they engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Act by making each of the 76 duration and clearance representations in relation to the October 2005 sale in Darwin. 13 A further sale was conducted in Darwin by Terania and ARE in February-March 2006.
 Again, they accept, and I find, that they did not have reasonable grounds for making those representations and that they thereby engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the Act. 15 Apart from the duration and clearance representations, Terania and ARE accept that they engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct at certain of those sales by other conduct.
 Terania and ARE shall, at their own expense and for the purpose of ensuring that Terania and ARE maintain and continue to implement the Compliance Programme, cause a review of the Compliance Programme ("the review") to be carried out in accordance with each of the following requirements: 4.1 Terania and ARE shall ensure that the review is carried out by an independent compliance professional with expertise in trade practices law ("the reviewer").
