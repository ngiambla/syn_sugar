 Having read the Tribunal's reasons for reaching its conclusions, I am satisfied that Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones's summary of those considerations at [10] is entirely accurate and I will simply quote the summary: (a) The applicant's evidence contained in his Protection Visa application and oral evidence given to the Tribunal hearing on 24 October 2006 contained a number of inconsistencies in relation to the circumstances in which he was caught engaging in homosexual sex with his partner in 1972.
 The Tribunal was concerned by the applicant's failure, and inconsistent evidence resulted in the Tribunal forming the view that this incident had not occurred. (b) The applicant failed to provide evidence to corroborate his claimed relationship or other aspects of his claims. (c) The applicant's claim that he had a homosexual partner in Saipan for many years but he was unable to explain why he had not contacted that person since leaving Saipan.
 However, he later claimed that his family did not mention his getting married "because they knew he was a homosexual. " The Tribunal found this changing evidence concerning the applicant's family's change in attitude was unconvincing and cast further doubt upon his claim that they ever perceived the applicant to be homosexual. (h) The applicant claimed to fear his former partner's family.
 The proceedings before the Tribunal are not before this court in the sense of any transcript, which might reveal the sequence of questioning by the Tribunal. 28 However, the reasons formulated by the Tribunal canvass the factual assertions of the appellant and all the related material which went to the analysis of whether the Tribunal could be satisfied that the contended ground of a well-founded fear of persecution, namely, that ground of social engagement in homosexual relationships and persecution arising from those relationships was made out.
