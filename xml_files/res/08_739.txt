 1 The applicant seeks leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith dismissing the applicant's application for judicial review of a decision by the second respondent Refugee Review Tribunal not to grant him a protection visa: see SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 190.
 The application was dismissed. 6 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal from the judgment of the court below. 7 Grounds one and two of the draft notice of appeal are drafted in the broadest terms and have not been particularised by the applicant.
 This will complement the RRT's existing obligation under section 424A , in that, if the RRT does not orally give information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under section 424AA , it must do so in writing, under section 424A.
