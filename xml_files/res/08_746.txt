 An award of nominal damages is appropriate to vindicate the invasion of the applicant's proprietary right ( MJA Scientifics International Pty Ltd v S C Johnson and Son Pty Ltd (1998) 43 IPR 275 at 281 per Sundberg J) and I award the sum of $10.00. 17 In relation to the claim for additional damages under s 115(4) of the Act , it is appropriate to begin by making the following general observations.
 It seems to me considering authorities such as Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Miyamoto (aka DJ Moto ) (2004) 62 IPR 605 and Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith [2005] FCA 228 ; (2005) 215 ALR 788 that the circumstances may call for an award of additional damages, or a larger award of additional damages, if there is a real need to deter similar infringements of copyright.
 Thirdly, the applicant refers to the fact that the respondents only conceded an infringement by them of the applicant's copyright in the artworks during their closing submissions in the trial and that was on the fifth day of the hearing. 31 These facts are correct but I think they are relevant to costs rather than to an award of additional damages.
