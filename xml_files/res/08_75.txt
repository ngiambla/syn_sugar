 The information furnished by ACCC correctly indicated that in relation to those three items, they were offered for sale, between 1 March 2006 and 1 April 2006, at the "was" price identified in the Love You Mum catalogue even though they were gold items subject to a price increase effective 1 March 2006.
 It was misleading to identify in the catalogue a "was" price which did not represent the price at which an item had been offered for sale and would have been purchased by the hypothetical consumer immediately before the sale commenced.
 In the present case it was quite misleading to identify a "was" price in the Love You Mum catalogue when the items had not been offered for sale at that price since 26 December 2005 (a period of approximately 4 months).
