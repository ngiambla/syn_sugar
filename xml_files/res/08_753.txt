 All financial matters between the parties were resolved at the conference and on the same day, final property orders were made in accordance with the orders referred to in par [4] above. 20 The defendants object to any evidence being given by the plaintiff as to what occurred at the conciliation conference on the grounds that evidence of what was said at the conference is inadmissible.
 This issue was not the subject of argument or submissions before me and having regard to the conclusion which I have reached, it is not necessary for me to address or resolve it. 27 I am satisfied that the challenged evidence upon which the plaintiff relies (pars 42 and 43 of his affidavit sworn on 30 November 2007 and pars 8, 9, 10 and 11 of his affidavit sworn on 15 February 2008) falls within subs (1) of s 131 of the Evidence Act .
 These issues relate to whether Ms Asciak made full disclosure of all the information sought from her prior to the conciliation conference on 30 August 2006, whether there are any deficiencies in the expert's report, and whether there is a basis for the plaintiff's claim that there was a misrepresentation made to him as to the true value of his interest in the defendant companies.
