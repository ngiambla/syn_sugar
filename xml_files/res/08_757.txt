 1 The sole issue before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by the Honourable C R Wright QC, Deputy President, was whether the applicant's permanent impairment by reason of her psychological condition had become permanent prior to 1 December 1988, the date of commencement of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (the 1988 Act).
 Section 124(3) provides that a person is not entitled to compensation under s 24 of the 1988 Act in respect of a permanent impairment where there was no entitlement to receive lump sum compensation under the legislation in force at the time the impairment occurred.
