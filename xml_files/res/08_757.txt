 1 The sole issue before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by the Honourable C R Wright QC, Deputy President, was whether the applicant's permanent impairment by reason of her psychological condition had become permanent prior to 1 December 1988, the date of commencement of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) (the 1988 Act).
 Section 124(3) provides that a person is not entitled to compensation under s 24 of the 1988 Act in respect of a permanent impairment where there was no entitlement to receive lump sum compensation under the legislation in force at the time the impairment occurred.
 Indeed, although there have been fluctuations in the intensity and duration of symptoms since 1 December 1988, the applicant's overall condition of impairment has not increased since that time, and viewed generally, she is now much improved and is likely to continue at about her current level.
