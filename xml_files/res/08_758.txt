 The appellant has, in support of the grounds of appeal to this Court, provided written submissions which, plainly enough, have been prepared on his behalf by a third party and although those written submissions speak to the grounds of appeal as such, the submissions also add a further matter, namely, that the Tribunal made its comments in bad faith. 6 No particulars of bad faith are advanced and nor is there any argument addressed on the question of bad faith.
 I do that because really the whole appeal proceeds on the footing that the Federal Magistrate erred by failing to identify the contended errors of the Tribunal. 7 The background facts are set out at AB53, AB54, AB55, and AB56 and it is not necessary in these reasons to recite aspects of those background facts.
 The Tribunal in its letter made mention of its concern that in the original application, the appellant had said he would try to obtain documents to demonstrate that he had been harassed with a forgery case by the ruling party but had made no mention of a claim subsequently made that he had been falsely charged with the murder of Biplob on 12 June 2004.
 The Tribunal was not obliged to make findings of fact in respect of each and every piece of evidence before it. 37 It was sufficient for the Tribunal to consider whether the evidence of the appellant could be accepted and if, in the light of the inconsistencies, the evidence could not be accepted, it was open to the Tribunal to reject the claims.
