 The Tribunal in its letter made mention of its concern that in the original application, the appellant had said he would try to obtain documents to demonstrate that he had been harassed with a forgery case by the ruling party but had made no mention of a claim subsequently made that he had been falsely charged with the murder of Biplob on 12 June 2004.
 The Tribunal was not obliged to make findings of fact in respect of each and every piece of evidence before it. 37 It was sufficient for the Tribunal to consider whether the evidence of the appellant could be accepted and if, in the light of the inconsistencies, the evidence could not be accepted, it was open to the Tribunal to reject the claims.
