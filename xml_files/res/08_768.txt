 1 The Appellant claims to be a citizen of India. 2 The Appellant arrived in Australia on 3 March 2007 and applied to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for a Protection (Class XA) Visa on 29 March 2007.
 In respect of the second ground the applicant had not provided any particulars to show why the Tribunal had not complied with the provisions of s 424A of the Migration Act as he claims.
 That sub-section provides as follows: Tribunal must invite applicant to appear (1) The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review.
 The need for caution arises by reason of the fact that in many appeals, as in the present appeal, the Notice of Appeal is all too frequently drafted by unidentified persons and with apparent little regard to either the decision of the Tribunal or -- more importantly -- the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court.
