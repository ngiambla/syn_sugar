 In addition, O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules provides that a pleading may be struck out in whole or part where it discloses no reasonable cause of action, has a tendency to cause prejudice, embarrassment or delay, or is otherwise an abuse of process.
 At [61], his Honour identifies the necessary elements of the tort as follows: (i) a combination or agreement between two or more individuals; (ii) an intent to injure; (iii) the carrying out of certain acts pursuant to that agreement and with that intention; and (iv) loss and damage to the claimant.
 It is further submitted that the trade practices claim should be struck out because the allegations of misrepresentations made in the FASC relate to the publication of a prospectus some nine years after the original patent application, which lapse of time demonstrates the fallacy in arguing that the identified loss and damage was suffered as a result of those misrepresentations. 21 I accept that each of these identified deficiencies is present in the FASC.
