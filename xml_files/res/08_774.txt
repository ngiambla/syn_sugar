 One matter of controversy relates to a number of documents which were submitted to the Tribunal by the appellant in support of the application and these documents are relied upon by the appellant as powerful, it is said, corroboration of the oral evidence of engagement in the events of 7 May 2004 and 8 May 2004 and thus a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
 The appellant says that the Tribunal ought to have made an investigation into the documents and satisfied itself as to the accuracy of the documents and, in particular, the matters to which the documents go. 11 The Tribunal when analysing both the documents and the oral evidence approached the matter in this way.
 The Tribunal reached this conclusion: In the present case, and based on the evidence and its findings, the Tribunal is not satisfied that an essential and significant reason the applicant may be sought on return, is for one of the reasons in the refugee convention.
