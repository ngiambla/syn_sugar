 The Tribunal in its reasons considered whether serious harm was a prospect on all of the evidence available to the Tribunal. 7 The Tribunal considered the circumstances of the appellant's sister who also appeared at the hearing and provided an affidavit.
 The appellant's brother also gave evidence which failed to support such a conclusion and the evidence of the appellant's wife put to the Tribunal was found to be evidence "in very general terms". 8 As a result of all of these matters, the Tribunal was unable to be satisfied that the appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.
 The Tribunal found that the appellant had not suffered Convention related persecution and on the basis of independent country information rejected the appellant's claim of a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh noting that the appellant did not claim to have any political affiliation in Bangladesh.
