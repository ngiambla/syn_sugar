 INCONSISTENT OR CONTRADICTORY FINDINGS? 7 The first finding made by the Tribunal and now relied upon by the Appellant in his Notice of Appeal is the following: "The Tribunal accepts the Applicant may have been involved in humanitarian work through his temple and in association with Madho once he started working for him in 1984, however the Tribunal is not satisfied that he was committed to this work as he claimed given the inconsistencies in his evidence as to his involvement in these activities at various times."...
 Concurrence is expressed with the reliance by the Federal Magistrate upon SZBYR v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616 and his Honour's conclusion that such findings do not fall within s 424A(1)(a).
 APPELLANT'S WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS? 21 At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant explained that both his Notice of Appeal , filed on 25 March 2008, and his written submissions, filed on 14 May 2008, were drafted by a Pakistani lawyer who had apparently returned to Pakistan on or about 16 May 2008.
