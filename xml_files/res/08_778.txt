 The latter finding is a conclusion that the Appellant had not worked for " human rights " but that he " may have " provided assistance, and a conclusion as to the active work undertaken by the Appellant over a " period of 15 or more years ". 9 There is not considered to be any necessary inconsistency or contradiction as between those two findings. 10 When considering the decision of an administrative tribunal, including the Refugee Review Tribunal, considerable caution must be exercised in construing the findings and reasons set forth in that decision: Minister for Immigration Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.
 This approach has since been endorsed: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [25] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 617 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ; Black v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [36] , [2007] FCAFC 189 ; 99 ALD 1 at 9. 11 Not only is there no necessary inconsistency as between the two findings relied upon by the Appellant, it is further considered that the findings and reasons of the Tribunal -- when read in their entirety -- dispel any support for the asserted " inconsistency ".
 Whatever support may have been provided to the Appellant's argument by reason of the distinction drawn by the Tribunal as between " humanitarian work " and work for " human rights " -- had that distinction remained unexplained -- that support is removed once the distinction is explained and understood. 12 It is an impermissible course for an appellant to seize upon two findings made by the Tribunal and to thereafter attempt to weave a fabric of contradiction or inconsistency founded solely upon those findings and divorced from the balance of the reasoning process. 13 To construe the reasons provided by the Tribunal as involving an " inconsistency ", it is considered, would be to engage in the " over-zealous judicial review " warned against in Wu Shan Liang.
 Compliance with this provision is mandatory: SAAP v Minister for Immigration Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 , 215 ALR 162 ; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [13] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 614 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ. 16 One difficulty confronting the Appellant is that the second Ground of Appeal does not identify any " information " which falls within the provisions of s 424A(1)(a).
 Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [[2004] FCAFC 123 , 206 ALR 471 at 477] that the word "information". does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc.
