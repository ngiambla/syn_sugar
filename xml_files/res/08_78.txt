 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of Dowsett J of 14 December 2007 ( Welsh v Digilin Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 2064) pursuant to s 24(1A) Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and O 52 r 10 Federal Court Rules , and for an order that the judgment of his Honour be stayed pursuant to O 52 r 17 Federal Court Rules .
 Dismissal pending payment of costs: Gao v Zhang 9 In her submissions Ms Heyworth-Smith for the applicant relied on the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Gao v Zhang [2005] VR 380, a decision to which his Honour also referred in his judgment.
 However, his Honour observed further that, although the Supreme Court had power to make an order for a stay, dismissal or striking out where orders for costs of interlocutory applications remained unpaid, it did not necessarily follow that whenever costs remained outstanding some such order should be made (at 383).
