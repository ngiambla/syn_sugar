 INTRODUCTION 1 On 20 December 2007 I made orders pursuant to s 21(2)(b)(i) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) (the Act) on the application of Jan Tervonen quashing an order of the second respondent made on 6 June 2007 that Tervonen was eligible for surrender to the first respondent, the Republic of Finland, for certain offences, and the consequent issue of a warrant pursuant to s 19(9) of the Act ( Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067).
 The following appears in that warrant: "Special prerequisites for arrest The maximum punishment for the crime is imprisonment of one year or more, and there is reason to suspect that the suspect will flee or otherwise avoid the pre-trial investigation, the criminal proceedings or the enforcement of the punishment, obstruct investigations and continue criminal activity.
 This coercive measure can be deemed justified considering the seriousness of the offence, the importance of solving the case, the violation of the rights of the suspect and other persons the application of this coercive measure means, as well as other relevant factors. " 16 The request for the eighth warrant was made by another Detective Superintendent.
