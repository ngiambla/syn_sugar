 The Tribunal has found that the applicant has not been a practitioner of Falun Gong in China in the past, has not been a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong while here in Australia and finds, following from this, that she will not be a Falun Gong practitioner should she return to China.
 The task of making those findings has been entrusted to the Tribunal, and not the Federal Magistrates Court or (more relevantly) to this Court on appeal: Nguyen v Migration Review Tribunal [2008] FCA 524 at [15] per Logan J.
 That finding is, again, one entrusted to the Tribunal and it is not considered that it is possible to sustain a contention that the conclusion of the Tribunal was without evidential support. 16 The second ground is also rejected. 17 The final ground is also misconceived.
