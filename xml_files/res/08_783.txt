 Dr Bell's submission was that, at least with respect to documents which have been admitted into evidence, exceptional circumstances are required for an application under O 46 r 6(3) to be refused. 34 It is true that in ACCC v ABB Finkelstein J expressed the principle in terms which reflect Dr Bell's submission.
 But in my opinion, Seven Network and other relevant authorities do not establish a rule that there must be exceptional circumstances for an application to be refused. 35 As Sackville J observed in Seven Network at [24], O 46 r 6 does not confer a right on a non-party to obtain access to documents admitted into evidence.
 His Honour there said that, unless the interests of justice require otherwise, the Court would ordinarily take the view that a non-party should have access to all non-confidential documents and other material admitted into evidence. 37 Sackville J went on at [27] to make the important point that in each application the Court will have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case.
