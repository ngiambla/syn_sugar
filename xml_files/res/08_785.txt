 An appointment between Ms Sibley and the applicant was scheduled for the morning of 29 April 2008. 8 Mr Yulianto is a diplomatic representative of the Republic of Indonesia and the effect of his evidence is that he has met the applicant three times and obtained information "on a preliminary basis" from the applicant about the applicant's detention and the destruction of the applicant's fishing vessel.
 The applicant expressly did not contend that the rights expressed in the article had attained the status of customary international law and, even if they had, it by no means follows that they are for that reason enforceable by this Court.
 In my opinion, the Convention is not, having regard to the language of the Act, its purpose and subject-matter, a relevant consideration to the exercise of the power in the sense that an officer acting under the section would exceed his or her jurisdiction in not having regard to its provisions.
