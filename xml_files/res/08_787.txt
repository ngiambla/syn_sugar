 On 25 July 2006 the Tribunal handed down its decision affirming the decision of the delegate to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant. 3 On 21 August 2006 the appellant lodged an application for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court. 4 The application contained four grounds.
 It seems to me that in the circumstances before him the Federal Magistrate had the choice of granting the appellant an adjournment so that he could obtain the tape recording of the Tribunal hearing or, upon a proper exercise of the discretion, refusing an adjournment and proceeding to hear the application for judicial review.
 However, it seems, from his reasons at least, that the Federal Magistrate was saying that evidence from the appellant as to what transpired at the hearing would not be evidence in support of his claim, or could not be, or could not be accepted in the absence of corroboration.
