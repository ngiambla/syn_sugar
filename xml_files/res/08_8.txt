 I shall refer to this ground of alleged invalidity as "the identity of action ground". 9 Alternatively, Blue Wedges says that even if the Project the subject of the Approval Decision is not relevantly different from what was described in the Referral, the Assessment did not adequately assess the relevant impacts of the Project and/or provide enough information to enable the Federal Minister to make an informed decision.
 The 2007 Assessment considers the impact on nine listed seabirds and twenty-six listed shorebirds, none of which are determined to be threatened by the action. (d) Commonwealth land : The 2002 Controlled Action decision identifies one area of Commonwealth land which may be impacted by the 2002 Action: Swan Island.
