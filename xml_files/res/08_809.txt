 For these reasons, Unilever says there is a strong prima facie case that Cussons is engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct, and the grant of an interlocutory injunction is appropriate. 7 In response, Cussons contends that the qualification was appropriately prominent because it appears on the front of the label and is connected by an asterisk to the Radiant Statement.
 Accordingly, Unilever resists the grant of the interlocutory orders sought by Cussons on its cross-claim. 17 Cussons' position in respect of the balance of convenience is that the Court should not grant the interlocutory relief sought against it by Unilever.
 Cussons also says that the damage it would suffer would be unquantifiable, and it offers to cooperate to ensure that the matter progresses to an early final hearing. 18 I consider that the appropriate course in the present case is to not grant any interlocutory relief in respect of either the claim or the cross-claim and to set the matter down for hearing on a final basis as soon as possible so that the evidence can be thoroughly appraised.
