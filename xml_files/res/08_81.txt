 ANALYSIS 24 With this background and legislative framework in mind, I now turn to the first issue, namely whether the applicant was entitled to determine its GST liability under s 75-10(3) of the GST Act, based on the difference between the sale price of each Stratum Unit and the value of the Stratum Unit as at 1 July 2000.
 However, it is the Respondent's position that the references in s 75-10(3) to an "interest, unit or lease" should be interpreted in accordance with the principles set out by the Federal Court at first instance in Sterling Guardian Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCA, at [23-40] in relation to Section 75-10(2).
 In that case, Stone J held that, where the property was subdivided after the purchase, the acquisition cost of each unit for the purposes of s 75-10(2) was the cost of the corresponding portion of the "parent" title and it was irrelevant that the individual stratum units did not exist at the time of acquisition.
 The specific wording of s 75-10(3), of the table in s 75-10(3) and of s 75-5(2), and then the specific reference back in these provisions to the supply of the stratum unit in s 75-5(1) supports this view. 36 The applicant, in an attempt to refute the approach that the acquired property should be identical to the supplied or sold property, referred to s 75-15, which provides: Subdivided land For the purposes of section 75-10, if the freehold interest, stratum unit or long-term lease you supply relates only to part of land or premises that you acquired, the consideration for your acquisition of that part is the corresponding proportion of the consideration for the land or premises that you acquired. 37 Section 75-15 has a specific function.
