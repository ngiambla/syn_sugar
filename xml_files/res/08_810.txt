 He also acknowledged that Allphones had 'to disclose what is due and payable to the franchisee as a result of their activities under their dealer code , [that is] the activation of a mobile service under the franchise agreement' (emphasis added).

 Allphones was obliged under cll 7.4 and 7.5 to pay commission to Hoy Mobile on all sums which Allphones received from carriers in respect of sales and activations of plans effected by Hoy Mobile.
