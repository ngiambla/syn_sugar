 1 On 16 April last, declarations and orders were made in this proceeding following delivery of reasons for judgment on 11 April 2008 ( A L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466).
 Bahonko [2008] FCAFC 30 establishes that a discrete federal claim is not affected by the restrictions on the award of costs in the Workplace Relations Act .
 The fact that a third party is involved in funding the costs of a party would not normally have any significance in relation to an entitlement to an order for costs by the party.
 The fact that one applicant is publicly funded does not alter the situation in principle. 6 Another matter raised by the respondents is the effect of s 45DC and s 84(2) of the Trade Practices Act .
