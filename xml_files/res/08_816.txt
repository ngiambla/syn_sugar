 Express words 12 The Respondent concluded that reg 20.3(3)(a)(ii) refers to employment in a company or firm in which an employee undertakes patent work for that company or firm and does not extend to include experience in a law firm undertaken on behalf of client companies or firms.
 If that is correct (and it was not suggested that his Honour was wrong), the practical effect of the omission may be no more than a recognition that applicants who have worked overseas as a technical assistant for a patent attorney who is not registered under the 1990 Patents Act , may still satisfy the employment requirement of reg 20.3(3)(a)(i).
