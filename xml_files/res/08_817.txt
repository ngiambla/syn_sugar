 Three of the unions (together ' the Respondents ') have now filed motions seeking to restrain Sydney Ferries from proceeding with an application for certain orders in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (' AIRC '), pending resolution of the proceedings in this Court (see [16] below). 2 By its application in this Court, Sydney Ferries seeks an interpretation of similar, but not identical, clauses in each of the Enterprise Agreements.
 If the AIRC is unable to resolve the matter within the 48 hour period specified in s 496(5) (as seems very likely), it will have to address the question of statutory construction in the course of determining whether to make an interim order pursuant to s 496(6) of the Workplace Relations Act . 27 The vice of the procedure adopted by Sydney Ferries seems to me to be as follows.
 By withdrawing its application for interlocutory relief, Sydney Ferries also withdrew its contention, at least for the purposes of the interlocutory proceedings, that the respondents had organised or engaged in ' industrial action '. 28 By instituting proceedings in the AIRC the day after withdrawing its interlocutory application, Sydney Ferries seeks to achieve, in substance, the same result in the AIRC that it failed to achieve in this Court.
 Moreover, if the AIRC made the orders sought by Sydney Ferries, the onus would be on the Respondents to challenge the orders, whether by way of an appeal to a Full Bench of the AIRC (for which leave is necessary), or, more likely, by an application in this Court or the High Court by way of constitutional writs alleging jurisdictional error.
