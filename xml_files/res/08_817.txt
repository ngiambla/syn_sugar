 By withdrawing its application for interlocutory relief, Sydney Ferries also withdrew its contention, at least for the purposes of the interlocutory proceedings, that the respondents had organised or engaged in ' industrial action '. 28 By instituting proceedings in the AIRC the day after withdrawing its interlocutory application, Sydney Ferries seeks to achieve, in substance, the same result in the AIRC that it failed to achieve in this Court.
 Moreover, if the AIRC made the orders sought by Sydney Ferries, the onus would be on the Respondents to challenge the orders, whether by way of an appeal to a Full Bench of the AIRC (for which leave is necessary), or, more likely, by an application in this Court or the High Court by way of constitutional writs alleging jurisdictional error.
