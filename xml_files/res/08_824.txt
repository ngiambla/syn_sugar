 Reference is made to a report which indicates that there is in excess of $1.6 million of unpaid client funds missing from the former tax agent. 8 The evidence also suggests that Nationwide's new agent, Mr Santoro, has been taking steps to ascertain what moneys were remitted or alternatively, paid to the agent but not accounted for.
 He has offered an undertaking as to damages as well as an undertaking on behalf of Mr Nemes to pay the sum of $35,000 into Court within seven days. 14 In my view, the submissions made by Mr Johnson and the evidence to which I have been taken does not establish that the notice was served for an improper purpose or that it would constitute an abuse of process for the Deputy Commissioner to proceed with an application to wind up Nationwide.
 Whilst it would appear from the evidence before me that the Deputy Commissioner accepts that he has a responsibility to monitor the affairs of registered tax agents, I do not see that this creates a duty to Nationwide or to Mr Nemes, which, in the circumstances of this case, would give rise to an abuse of process by reason of the estimate of the running account that was made. 18 It is also important to bear in mind that the statutory demand is not limited to the amount of the running balance account.
