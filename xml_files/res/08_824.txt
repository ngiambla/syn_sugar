 He also points to the fact that a statutory demand served on Mr Peter Nemes, a director of Nationwide, was set aside by order of the Court. 6 The evidence before me shows that the difficulty in which Nationwide finds itself is that its former tax agent received large amounts of funds on behalf of its various clients, including Nationwide, but apparently failed to account to the ATO for the moneys which were to be remitted to the ATO by the agent. 7 The substance of the evidence is summed up in [7] of Mr Nemes affidavit of 16 May 2008, which suggests that the former tax agent or entities related to it may not have remitted the funds to the ATO.
 Nationwide's former tax agent was a person or company who was a registered tax agent, in respect of whom the Deputy Commissioner had obligations and responsibilities in accordance with those that I have outlined. 13 Mr Johnson recognises that in order to obtain the relief that he seeks, it is necessary to offer certain undertakings to the Court.
 He has offered an undertaking as to damages as well as an undertaking on behalf of Mr Nemes to pay the sum of $35,000 into Court within seven days. 14 In my view, the submissions made by Mr Johnson and the evidence to which I have been taken does not establish that the notice was served for an improper purpose or that it would constitute an abuse of process for the Deputy Commissioner to proceed with an application to wind up Nationwide.
