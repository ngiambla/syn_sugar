 The decision not to revoke that Notice was made on 26 July 2007. 3 The Application as originally filed, it should however be noted, also sought to review: (i) what was said to be a failure to provide a statement in accordance with s 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth).
 Whichever "Particular" is sought to be relied upon, and whatever may be the Ground of Review to which it is ascribed, no reviewable error has been exposed in the decision of the First Respondent or, it should be noted, in the decision of the delegate.
 Such correspondence includes a letter dated 16 March 2007 from the Applicant to the First Respondent and a further letter from the Applicant dated 27 April 2007 to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory (and copied to the First Respondent).
 An appeal has been dismissed: Minister for Immigration Citizenship v Haneef [2007] FCAFC 203 , 163 FCR 414. 55 The Ground that alleges the exercise of the power for an " improper purpose " again repeats the reliance placed by the First Respondent upon some issues being better determined by a court.
