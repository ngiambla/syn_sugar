 It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise.
 Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice. 14 The " enactment " pursuant to which any decision made by the Authority has been taken is identified in the Amended Application as being either s 255 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) or s 56(4) of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998 (Cth).
