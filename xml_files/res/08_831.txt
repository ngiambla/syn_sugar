 Mr Prince sets out in his affidavit an explanation the effect of which is that his failure to attend to the preparation of the Notice of Appeal was due to inadvertence and an extremely busy workload. 4 The leading authority on the question of the meaning of the term "special reasons" is Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187.
 His Honour went on to say that this of itself is not sufficient to establish a special reason, but it is important to note that he also observed that inadvertence can, of course, be taken into account. 8 It seems to me that the decision in Roda Kabail is distinguishable from the present application.
 Their Honours went on to say that: So, for example, where the delay is short and no injustice will be occasioned to the respondent, justice will usually be done if the extension of time is granted. 11 Here the delay is comparatively short and there is, in my view, an acceptable explanation for it.
 Again, I will return to that issue later. 13 The reason why I consider Mr Prince's explanation to be acceptable is that Mr Prince appeared as pro bono counsel and, as I have said, the delay was fairly short.
