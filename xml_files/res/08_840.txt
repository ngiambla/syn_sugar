 Ms Snape for the State of Queensland and Ms Humphris representing various shire councils and other interests neither consented to nor opposed the notice of motion. 3 The native title application, to which this notice of motion relates, has a long history.
 Indeed, this is a proposition shared by, realistically, all parties to these proceedings. 5 I made orders last September which recognised that the native title claim was flawed and contemplated that either the applicant discontinue the application or that the application be dismissed in lieu of a notice of motion to amend the application.
 I also note that notwithstanding this conference of experts, a consensual agreement could not be reached among those experts as to the description of the claim group in the Darling Downs region.
 I also endorse Mr Boge's submission that yet another expert report, even by a senior consultant anthropologist, would not endorse the native title application currently filed. 7 My orders of 7 September 2007 gave the applicant ample time to get its claim in order.
