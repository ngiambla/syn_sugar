 Ms Snape for the State of Queensland and Ms Humphris representing various shire councils and other interests neither consented to nor opposed the notice of motion. 3 The native title application, to which this notice of motion relates, has a long history.
 I also endorse Mr Boge's submission that yet another expert report, even by a senior consultant anthropologist, would not endorse the native title application currently filed. 7 My orders of 7 September 2007 gave the applicant ample time to get its claim in order.
