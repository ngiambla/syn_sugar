 Part 4 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules allows the respondent to file a response (r 4.04) which must be filed and served within 14 days after the service of the application, and an affidavit must be filed with the response (r 4.05).
 The principal issue raised by the applicant, namely the fact that the respondent served an affidavit several days late and with a page missing, was addressed by his Honour during the hearing on 29 May 2008.
 I note that, according to the Federal Magistrates Court file, the only witness upon whose evidence the applicant is currently relying is himself and yet if the applicant wished to rely on the evidence of other witnesses it would have been incumbent on him to file and serve affidavits of those witnesses in accordance with the timetable ordered by the Federal Magistrate.
