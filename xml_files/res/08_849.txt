 1 By application filed on 14 December 2007, the applicant, H K Systems Australia Pty Ltd, a licensed importer of firearms, seeks judicial review of a decision taken on 6 December 2007 by the newly appointed Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Robert Debus.
 They submit that it would not be appropriate to constrain the Minister in the exercise of the power conferred by s 77EA merely because his predecessor chose to exercise that power in a different way. 27 The respondents challenge grounds 4, 7 and 8 of the amended grounds of review.
 They say that insofar as these grounds have as their premise the notion that, under this Minister since December 2007 other rifles of a similar appearance to the Heckler and Koch SL 8-R have been imported and distributed freely, that fact alone cannot give rise to any reviewable error.
