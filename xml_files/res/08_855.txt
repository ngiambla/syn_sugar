 Paragraph [14] of the explanatory memorandum to the Migration (Offences and Undesirable Persons) Amendment Bill 1992 sets out the anticipated operation of s 180A of the Principal Act: This section provides a power, in addition to powers already in the Principal Act, to refuse to grant a visa or entry permit to a person, or to cancel a valid visa or entry permit held by a person.
 The 1992 Reform Act and the 1994 Amendment Act 24 The Migration Reform Act 1992 (Cth) substituted a single form of authority (a "visa") to travel to, enter, and remain in Australia for the then bifurcated authority system of visas which permitted travel to Australia and entry permits which permitted persons to enter or remain in Australia.
 Currently the Principal Act provides for one form of authority, a visa, which permits a person to travel to Australia, and for another form of authority, entry permit, which permits a person to enter and remain. ... (and later) ... there will no longer be a dual documentation system for travelling to Australia (visas) and entering and remaining in Australia (entry permits).
 Paragraph 42 of the explanatory memorandum to the 1992 Reform Bill provides an explanation as to the anticipated effect of s 40(5) and s 40(6): The clause [i.e. the relevant clause of the Migration Reform Bill 1992 which introduced proposed s 40(5) and s 40(6)] also provides that regulations may continue in force visas or entry permits of specified classes which were held immediately before the commencement of the Reform Bill provisions dealing with visas.
