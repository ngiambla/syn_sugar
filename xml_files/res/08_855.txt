 The 1992 Reform Act and the 1994 Amendment Act 24 The Migration Reform Act 1992 (Cth) substituted a single form of authority (a "visa") to travel to, enter, and remain in Australia for the then bifurcated authority system of visas which permitted travel to Australia and entry permits which permitted persons to enter or remain in Australia.
 Currently the Principal Act provides for one form of authority, a visa, which permits a person to travel to Australia, and for another form of authority, entry permit, which permits a person to enter and remain. ... (and later) ... there will no longer be a dual documentation system for travelling to Australia (visas) and entering and remaining in Australia (entry permits).
