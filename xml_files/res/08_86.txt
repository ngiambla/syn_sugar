 Reference may be made also to Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd Anor (1996) ATPR. 40 It suffices to ask here whether the applicants have made clear to ANZ and to the Court the nature of the claim they propound. 41 Prior to the filing of the notice of motion on 23 November 2007 (it is noted that an amended notice of motion was filed on 5 December 2007), there was correspondence between Freehills, the solicitors for ANZ, and Atanaskovic Hartnell, the solicitors for the applicants.
 Geomar Geomar's loss comprises: (a) lost opportunity to earn 23% on the sum invested by Geomar being $4,055,556 between 1 May 2003 and 3 September 2004; (b) lost opportunity to earn 29% on the balance following acquisition of part of the debt by Mr Chapman on 3 September 2004, leaving a balance of $536,880 for the period between 3 September 2004 and 31 December 2005 (at which time Geomar transferred its interest in the debt to Helebeth); (c) the loss of the principal sum of $536,880 on the basis that as at the date of the advance by Geomar to Newco of those moneys the true value of the debt acquired was nil, alternatively as at the date of transfer of interest to Helebeth by Geomar, the true value of the $536,800 debt was nil.
 This suggests that the Representations did continue to be operative after 1 May 2003 and were a direct cause, rather than an indirect cause, of the Internal Transfer. 59 It may be that when Mr Chapman paid $3,518,676 to Geomar on 3 September 2004 for an assignment of part of the debt owed to Geomar by Newco, Mr Chapman suffered a loss of the entire sum of $3,518,676 by reason of his having entered into the Transaction induced by the misleading or deceptive Representations made by ANZ.
