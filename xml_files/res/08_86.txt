 Reference may be made also to Multigroup Distribution Services Pty Ltd v TNT Australia Pty Ltd Anor (1996) ATPR. 40 It suffices to ask here whether the applicants have made clear to ANZ and to the Court the nature of the claim they propound. 41 Prior to the filing of the notice of motion on 23 November 2007 (it is noted that an amended notice of motion was filed on 5 December 2007), there was correspondence between Freehills, the solicitors for ANZ, and Atanaskovic Hartnell, the solicitors for the applicants.
 This suggests that the Representations did continue to be operative after 1 May 2003 and were a direct cause, rather than an indirect cause, of the Internal Transfer. 59 It may be that when Mr Chapman paid $3,518,676 to Geomar on 3 September 2004 for an assignment of part of the debt owed to Geomar by Newco, Mr Chapman suffered a loss of the entire sum of $3,518,676 by reason of his having entered into the Transaction induced by the misleading or deceptive Representations made by ANZ.
