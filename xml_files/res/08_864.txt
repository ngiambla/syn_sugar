 Mr Corcoran and Mr Ferguson (together, 'the applicants') each claim that they are unable to comply with the ITC and have commenced proceedings claiming that, in implementing and applying the ITC, Virgin has discriminated against them, directly and indirectly, under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) ('the Act'). 2 Both of the applicants are legally aided.
 Each applicant has filed a notice of motion seeking an order that, pursuant to O 62A r 1 of the Federal Court Rules , the maximum costs that may be recovered by each party on a party/party basis be limited to $15,000.
 The applicants' ability to pay costs 36 The applicants submit that a party should not be deterred from prosecuting a proper claim because of a fear of a costs order that he or she could not afford to pay.
 Would the applicants be forced to abandon proceedings if their applications were unsuccessful? 37 The applicants rely on the grant of legal aid and submit that costs should be capped at the extent of the legal aid indemnity provided to the applicants, as in Woodlands at 149.
