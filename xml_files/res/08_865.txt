 At the conclusion of the hearing of 4 June 2008, it was clear that, from the perspective of both the applicant and Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd ("the respondent"), the key issue was whether the Court was prepared to make the orders sought by the applicant in paras 2, 4 and 5 of the amended notice of motion. 3 During the hearing of 4 June 2008, Mr Peden for the applicant proffered an oral undertaking by the applicant in relation to contact by the applicant and its employees with clients of the respondent.
 The variability in the sampling and therefore the effectiveness on such an inconsistent product is a matter that is now an issue in the proceeding, given the evidence that has been obtained to date and is still being obtained, including that there is a real difference between the samples provided by the respondent pursuant to the Court-approved regime and the evidence obtained of other examples of termiglass that have been installed.
