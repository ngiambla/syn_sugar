 The claim against QBE was potentially a major asset of Kelso and Mr Sherman sought expressions of interest from creditors to fund the claim against QBE. 9 Prior to 21 August 2007 there was some discussion between Ms Phillips of Ferrier Hodgson and Mr Tiernan, the solicitor for Provident about the question of funding of the litigation against QBE.
 The correspondence to which I was taken by counsel for the liquidator demonstrates that there was a live issue as to the security over the Moree property, in particular the value of that security. 10 On 15 August 2007 Ms Phillips had a telephone discussion with Mr Tiernan about a meeting of creditors which was called for 21 August 2007 to discuss the question of litigation funding.
 Ms Phillips' file note of the discussion records that she advised Mr Tiernan that he needed to complete a proof of debt and a proxy and it was necessary to estimate the value of the security held by Provident. 11 On 21 August 2007 Ms Phillips sent an email to Mr Tiernan stating: In addition, I enclose a proof of debt form for your completion in respect of the meeting of creditors.
