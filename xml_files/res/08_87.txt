 1 On 20 December 2007 on the application of the cross-respondent, Brivis Australia Pty Ltd (Brivis), I made an order that the cross-claimant, Seeley International Pty Ltd (Seeley), make further and better discovery of customer complaint files and service repair records of Seeley for the period between 1992 and April 2004.
 Relevantly, the cross-respondent sought: Complaint files and service repair records discovered by the cross-claimant and referred to at page 295 of the Judgment of O'Loughlin J in the proceedings between the cross-claimant and Newtronics in this Court. 3 The cross-respondent was in fact referring to [295] of the reasons for judgment of O'Loughlin J in Seeley International Pty Ltd v Newtronics Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1862.
 Further, it claims that the cross-claimant has suffered loss and damage by reason of the diversion of sales from the cross-claimant to the cross-respondent and a consequential loss. 5 In paragraph 8 of the cross-claim it is pleaded: The cross-claimant has since 1994 manufactured and offered for sale a range of rooftop evaporative air conditioners incorporating a sloping base.
