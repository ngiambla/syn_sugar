 An application for special leave to appeal from the decision of the Full Court has apparently been filed with the High Court. 5 At the same time that proceedings were progressing in respect of the August 2006 and April 2007 notices, the present proceedings came before this Court on a number of occasions.
 There is an " underlying policy " in the Rules that a discontinuing party should be liable to pay costs ( O'Neill v Mann [2000] FCA 1680 at [13] per Finn J) but that policy has not " hardened into a usual rule ": Smith v Airservices Australia [2005] FCA 997 at [44] , [2005] FCA 997 ; 146 FCR 37 at 49.
 From the Applicant's perspective, the assurance offered by the Respondent Minister that there would be no reliance placed upon the November 2007 notice was " as good as a win "; from the Minister's perspective, he maintained that the notice had been validly issued and also validly revoked, but that there was little point in ultimately resolving either contention.
 A view had been formed, however, that had it been necessary to resolve the Motion , the Applicant would in all likelihood have been unsuccessful. 22 The approach set forth by Finkelstein J in Gribbles Pathology does not preclude consideration being given to such an assessment as to prospects of success of an application or a motion filed in proceedings.
