 The first and second are proceedings to wind up two separate companies --- Hardel Investments Pty Limited is one and Avpri Pty Limited is the other --- at the suit of Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited and Alpha Asset Group Pty Limited.
 The third proceeding in time, although logically in a sense it is first, is an application by each of Hardel Investments Pty Limited and Avpri Pty Limited to set aside the statutory demands which are relied upon in support of the creditors' winding up proceedings. 2 The matter is very finely balanced.
