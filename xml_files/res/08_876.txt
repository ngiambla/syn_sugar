 I do not mean to suggest that Ajinomoto conceded that in point of law it was prevented from arguing that the new claims were not obvious.
 It was not until 20 March 2007, some six days before trial, that Nutrasweet amended its grounds of objection to include as a ground abuse of process.
 If notice of this ground had been given earlier, Ajinomoto would have had time to give it due consideration and, if it had then decided to proceed, there might have been some basis for seeking indemnity costs.
