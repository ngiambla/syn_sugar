 1 Following the delivery of the judgment in which I found Ajinomoto's patent to be invalid for obviousness, Ajinomoto applied to me to recall the judgment and reopen the case for further argument.
 In no small measure the costs incurred in the amendment application were significant because the parties had geared up to have determined whether the proposed new claims also failed for lack of inventive step, or were bad for lack of fair basis and lack of utility. 3 Initially Nutrasweet had objected to the proposed amendments on a number of grounds.
 Ajinomoto also filed evidence relating to obviousness. 5 Ajinomoto had adopted the position that if an estoppel operated it was confined to the old claims.
 For its part Ajinomoto dropped its contention that it would, in relation to the proposed new claims, reargue the invalidity finding that had gone against it at trial.
 I do not mean to suggest that Ajinomoto conceded that in point of law it was prevented from arguing that the new claims were not obvious.
 In short, the cases say that a court should only depart from requiring costs to be paid on a party and party basis if the interests of justice require it.
 On the amendment application I was going to be asked to reconsider inventiveness and that left open the possibility of inconsistent findings if I had changed my mind.
 In any event I do not think that application added greatly to the costs that were otherwise incurred. 14 I will decline to make an indemnity costs order on the amendment application for a different reason.
 It was not until 20 March 2007, some six days before trial, that Nutrasweet amended its grounds of objection to include as a ground abuse of process.
 But I would not accede to the application in a case where the successful ground was first raised immediately before trial. 15 For the foregoing reasons Nutrasweet should have its costs of both the application to amend and the application to reopen, such costs to be taxed on a party and party basis.
