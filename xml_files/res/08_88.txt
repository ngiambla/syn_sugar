 If it is conceded, as it must be, that a party upon whom a witness statement is served may use that statement in any way within the context of those proceedings (that is the whole reason why it is filed and served), it follows that it is conduct "inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect " ( Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at [29] ) and an implied waiver of privilege has occurred.
 Nevertheless, counsel for the ACCC maintained that this expectation was not inconsistent with a reasonable expectation that statements provided to the ACCC will remain confidential because most cartel cases settle with the result that: (1) it never becomes necessary for witness statements of whistleblowers to be used in court; and (2) the entry into the public domain of witness statements of whistleblowers is the exception rather than the rule.
 The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs: ACCC Position Paper, "Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct" (26 August 2005) at 19 n 21, available at http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=725616nodeId=3a1faa8ec1e755f25adef02560676bf5fn=Leniency%20position%20paper.pdf (viewed 1 February 2008). 34 As noted earlier, the ACCC waived any legal professional privilege claim it may have had over the Category II documents, of which the 8 Category III documents are a subset, when it filed and then served the documents on Visy.
