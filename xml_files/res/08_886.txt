 (REVISED FROM THE JUDGMENT) 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (given on 17 January 2008) that it had no jurisdiction in the matter: SZIIG v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FMCA 344. 2 The applicant arrived in Australia as long ago as 30 August 1997.
 The applicant had originally sought to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal made on 30 June 2003 and handed down on 25 July 2003 in respect of a decision of a delegate of the Minister given on 31 May 2001 to refuse him a protection visa.
 In that decision Scarlett FM found that the tribunal had said that the applicant's statement of events was highly implausible and it did not accept that he, being a Muslim, ever had a romantic relationship with a girl of the Hindu faith.
