 (REVISED FROM THE JUDGMENT) 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (given on 17 January 2008) that it had no jurisdiction in the matter: SZIIG v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FMCA 344. 2 The applicant arrived in Australia as long ago as 30 August 1997.
 The applicant had originally sought to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal made on 30 June 2003 and handed down on 25 July 2003 in respect of a decision of a delegate of the Minister given on 31 May 2001 to refuse him a protection visa.
 In that decision Scarlett FM found that the tribunal had said that the applicant's statement of events was highly implausible and it did not accept that he, being a Muslim, ever had a romantic relationship with a girl of the Hindu faith.
 For the reasons that I gave in SZGJY v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FCA 888 , it is clear that the tribunal had no jurisdiction on the second application for review filed at the end of last year: see also Minister for Immigration v Thiyagarajah [2000] HCA 9 ; (2000) 199 CLR 343 at 355-356 [30] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. 7 In my opinion, his Honour was correct to find that the present proceedings were an abuse of the process of the Federal Magistrates Court since they had no prospect of success and were seeking to re-agitate proceedings which had already been determined adversely to the applicant, through his previous challenges that had culminated earlier, in November last year, in his unsuccessful application for special leave to appeal. 8 As he said in his affidavit sworn on 20 March 2008 in support of his application for leave to appeal to this court: "I submitted a new application at the Refugee Review Tribunal to review the decision of the delegate on 13 December 2007 and the Tribunal refused my application on 17 January 2008. " 9 It is manifest that the tribunal never had any jurisdiction to decide a subsequent application to review the 2001 decision of a delegate once the 2006 decision of the tribunal had been given and not set aside in the courts.
