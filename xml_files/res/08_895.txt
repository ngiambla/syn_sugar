 First there are the costs thrown away by reason of the trial having to be adjourned on the second day of the hearing.
 Second are the costs of the resumed trial in which both the claim for infringement and the cross-claim for revocation were dismissed. 2 The costs of the adjournment present no difficulty.
 I note in passing, however, that I see no difficulty in holding that the incidence of costs should be decided on an issue by issue basis.
 Most often an apportionment of that kind will produce a better result than will the blunt application of the "costs follow the event" rule.
