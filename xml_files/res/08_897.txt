 This pleading has reference to s 601ED(1) of the Act, and leads to a pleading in para 38B that each Westpoint Product was therefore required by s 601ED to be registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). 11 Section 601ED(5) of the Act prohibits a person from operating a managed investment scheme that is required to be registered unless it is registered.
 Section 601EE provides that if a person operates a managed investment scheme in contravention of s 601ED(5) , ASIC, the person operating the scheme or a member of the scheme may apply to the Court to have the scheme wound up. 13 It follows, according to para 39, that each investment in each Westpoint Product was an interest in a managed investment scheme, and was therefore a "financial product" within the meaning of s 764A of the Act.
 Section 766B provides that financial product advice is, relevantly, a recommendation or a statement of opinion, or a report of either of those things, that is intended to influence a person or persons in making a decision in relation to a particular financial product, or class of financial products, or an interest in either, or could reasonably be regarded as being intended to have such an influence. 15 Division 2 of Pt 7.9 deals with "Product Disclosure Statements".
