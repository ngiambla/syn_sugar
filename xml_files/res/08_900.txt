 1 On 16 May 2008 I gave judgment for the respondents and directed written submissions as to costs: Your Water Your Say Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 670. 2 The general rule is that the losing party should pay the successful party's costs.
 In the same vein Marshall J said in Wilderness Society Inc v Turnbull [2007] FCA 1863 ; (2007) 98 ALD 651 at [30] : The real issue is not what is considered to be in the public interest or whether public interest considerations are a recognised exception to the usual rule, but rather, whether it can be said that there are sufficient public interest related reasons connected with or leading up to the litigation that warrant a departure from or outweigh the important consideration that a wholly successful respondent would ordinarily be awarded its costs. 3 Recently I declined to make an order for costs against an unsuccessful party in litigation raising environmental issues: Blue Wedges Inc v Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts [2008] FCA 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 211 at [73] .
 It was not a case of "de facto approval": see [2008] FCA 670 at [17] --- [21]. 5 Reference was made in the costs submissions of the applicant to an "advertorial" in the South Gippsland Sentinel-Times of 26 March 2008 which stated: The Federal Government determined that these works in themselves would not have any significant environmental effects and subsequently decided that they would not need to be subject to the requirements of EES. 6 Quite apart from the lack of proper proof, and consideration of the context, this does not add anything.
