 In the light of the answers to questions 1 to 5, whether the Applicant is entitled to an amount of compensation from the Respondent: 6.1. in respect of the forfeiture of the Ship, under section 3B of the Migration Act ; or 6.2. in respect of the destruction of the Ship, under section 4AB of the Customs Act .
 Section 5 of the Migration Act defines 'enter Australia' as follows: "enter Australia" , in relation to a person, means enter the migration zone. 26 It is not disputed that the ship entered the 'migration zone' after it entered waters comprising part of 'Australia'. 27 On the basis of the agreed facts, each of the Relevant Persons entered Australia on the ship when the ship entered the coastal area of Australia.
 Quite apart from the fact that an 'offence' is not required to enliven s 261A, the basis of the acquittal was an exculpatory provision, and contraventions exist under ss 42(1) , 232A and 233 of the Migration Act by virtue of the ship's entry into the Migration Zone.
