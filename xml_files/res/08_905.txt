 Unless such relevance can be shown, it is embarrassing and should be struck out. (8) The response to the request for particulars indicates that the 'EEO Policy' referred to in para [46] but not otherwise defined, is a reference back to the document headed 'Fair Employment Practices' referred to in the particulars at (ii) to para [19].
 I agree that this should be done and the amendments should identify which provisions or parts of the EEO Policy have been contravened in each case, consistent with the further particulars that have already been provided. (10) Paragraph [54] refers to the respondent's breach of the implied terms at paras [18] and [19], when the pleadings there refer to the terms as express terms.
 CONCLUSION 27 For the foregoing reasons, I propose to make orders striking out a number of the pleadings and claims in the SOC pursuant to O 11 r 16(b) of the Rules and for the applicant to amend others that I have identified in accordance with these reasons. 28 I propose to give the applicant leave to re-plead those pleadings and claims that are struck out.
