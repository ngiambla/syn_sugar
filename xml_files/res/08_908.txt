 The convictions were in relation to 11 DVDs, but the Magistrate observed that, over the whole of the period of Mr Plunkett's alleged conduct, there may have been several hundred DVDs copied and sold for profit by Mr Plunkett.
 His Honour took into account the loss which might have been sustained by the motion picture industry as a whole, and observed that Mr Plunkett had not made a large profit from his activities.
 Mr Plunkett also says that he has been unable to meet the mortgage repayments for his house and cannot afford to pay a sum in the order of $22,000 without losing the family home.
