 This was because, after the confiscation of his land in the Fuqing Economic Zone, he continued to farm on other land owned by him. 7 The Tribunal also found that the act of confiscation was not carried out for a Convention reason.
 But the difficulty with this statement is that it appears after the Tribunal had considered each step in the claim in isolation and without considering the impact of state involvement in the conduct: MZWPD at [72] --- [73]. 68 It follows in my view that the Tribunal failed to consider a substantial aspect or integer of the appellant's case that was sufficiently plain on the facts that were established: Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 at [24] ; NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at [55] --- [57]. 69 This amounted to a constructive failure to exercise the Tribunal's jurisdiction: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597; NABE at [48] --- [49]; WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [44]. 70 It is no answer to the finding of jurisdictional error that the Tribunal inferred from the appellant's post-2003 inactivity that he did not have a fear of persecution.
