 The appellant also claimed that he feared persecution from persons he had arrested during his service in the SLA in Lebanon. 6 The Tribunal was satisfied that the appellant had a genuine fear of Hezbollah, the Lebanese authorities, persons whom he arrested while serving in the SLA and others in Lebanon.
 It is submitted that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct test because it did not take account of a person who did not have the characteristics relied upon by the Tribunal to reach its conclusion that there was no chance of persecution, and that its finding left open the possibility that the appellant could be the subject of persecution.
 The Court is unable to find any error in his Honour's reasoning. 21 Secondly, the appellant submits that the Tribunal considered the risk of persecution in the past and present but did not consider that the appellant could suffer harm in the future.
 Since the Tribunal had not specifically asked for the identity of the relevant persons at the hearing and had not requested details of such in the Tribunal letter, the appellant was not placed on notice that unless he provided such detail, the Tribunal might make an adverse finding against him. 41 The Court is satisfied that the 'issues to which those reasoning processes were directed' (see SZBEL at [21]) were not adequately notified to the appellant.
