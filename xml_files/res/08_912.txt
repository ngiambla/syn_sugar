 It claims that Boutique, through the design and construction of its Villa View home, particularly a home known as the Villa View 4300, has substantially reproduced its Urban and Seasons designs. 12 The evidence establishes that the Villa View comes in three sizes: 33 squares, 36.5 squares and 43 squares.
 In that regard, both Mr Di Natale, Mr de Weerd, and Mr Lazarovski denied having seen any of the various advertisements and articles in newspapers and magazines tendered on behalf of Inform regarding the Urban and Seasons homes.
 Boutique said that this was an idea and not the expression of an idea and, in any event, an idea that was not novel. 111 Boutique contended that, if anything, the Urban was even more clearly distinguishable from the Villa View than the Seasons.
