 On 1 December 1997, the applicant failed to appear at the hearing and the Commission dismissed the complaint on two grounds: first, that the applicant had been given adequate notice of the time and place of the hearing; and second, that there was not a strong case against the respondent on the papers. 3 That decision was given on 8 May 1998.
 On 10 September 2003 the federal magistrate made orders for the applicant to file and serve affidavit material in support of his application, and in response to the strike out application, and fixed the application for hearing on 7 November 2003.
 The applicant puts before the court no reasons for this unreasonable delay. 7 Although that judgment was delivered on 7 November 2003, it was not until 14 April 2008 that the applicant filed an application for leave to appeal.
