 SUBSTITUTION OF PARTIES The plaintiffs rely on the deed dated 9 June 2005 between Martin Jones, one of the liquidators of Pearl Coast and Colin Andrew Sharp ("the Deed of Assignment") to establish the right of Mr Sharp to be substituted in place of Pearl Coast.
 The Deed of Assignment is therefore not capable of assigning the TPA and FTA causes of action to Mr Sharp and understandably the defendants oppose any order substituting Mr Sharp for Pearl Coast in relation to those causes of action.
 He then noted his consent for Mr Sharp to make a claim against Cossack under the TPA and FTA, provided that neither the joint liquidators personally nor Pearl Coast were liable for any costs of the plaintiffs or the defendants.
