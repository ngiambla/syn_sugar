 It is said on behalf of Barrett that Mr Roberts wishes to review the confidential report himself to review the claimed expenditure figures and methodology used to calculate the profit figures to ...benchmark them against his industry experience, and consider if there may be any anomalies.
 Knowledge to a competitor of costings and margins would be very valuable for the purpose of setting prices. 6 I do not think Barrett are seriously disadvantaged for the purpose of making its election because, as already mentioned, their Chief Financial Officer will have access to the report.
 If they wish, they could also retain some independent expert with knowledge of this particular industry. 7 I note in particular that Mr Roberts is a person who is involved in the day-to-day operations of the business, and so the more likely to be in a position to take advantage of the information.
