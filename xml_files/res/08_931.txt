 Mr Wallz stated that his minimum daily fee is $500 per day, and that he had "spent twenty one days compiling the (Reed Manual) at a cost of $10,500 ($500 x 21)" and "fourteen days preparing the delivery and presentation of the workshop at a cost of $7000 ($500 x 14)".
 Mr Wallz also stated that $246.52 of the sum received from Reed in payment for his services in presenting the workshop represented GST, which he is obliged to pay to the Australian Tax Office. 10 Tenderwatch claims the whole sum of $2711.71 as profit for which Mr Wallz must account.
 Mr Wallz disputes this on the basis that the printing costs, and the "cost" of his own time in compiling the Reed Manual and preparing for the workshop, should be deducted from that sum, as well as the GST component.
