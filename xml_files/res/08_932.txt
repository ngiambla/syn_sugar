 TRM 50 ("the Tyrannosaw Mark I"); (b) importing, making, selling, supplying, or otherwise disposing of or offering to make, sell, supply or otherwise dispose of or using or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things, the multi-purpose power saw sold under the name "Tyrannosaw" with Model No.
 These raised one further anticipation (a patent) in relation to the patents in suit and four in relation to the design and also 22 particulars in respect of which it was said the Standard Patent lacked clarity. 21 On 14 August 2006 GMCA filed its third particulars of invalidity.
 The particulars also deleted six pieces of prior art that had previously been cited against the design and introduced one new piece of prior art. 29 Since the adjournment of the trial a further four affidavits were filed on behalf of GMCA in May 2007.
