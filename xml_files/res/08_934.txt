 THE " SIGN " AS USED BY LION NATHAN ? 24 Section 120(2) dictates that Lion Nathan infringes the trade mark of Gallo Winery if Lion Nathan " uses as a trade mark a sign that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to " the trade mark of Gallo Winery .
 In response, Lion Nathan in its Amended Defence says that it " intends to offer for sale and sell an alcoholic product (not wine) under the trade mark BAREFOOT RADLER " and says that it " commenced to promote, advertise, offer for sale and sell in Australia a beer under the name BAREFOOT RADLER ".
 The foot very much was the brand and the brand was the foot, Barefoot ". 182 In such circumstances, it is not considered that the non-acquisition of the Logan Wines trade mark until September 2007 provided an " obstacle " to the use by Gallo Winery of the trade mark during May 2004 to May 2007.
