 This imposes upon Computershare both the obligation to make the register available for inspection and to provide a copy to any person entitled to receive a copy: s 174.
 The variable costs incurred are the cost of an administrative staff member operating the computer, the cost of purchasing a CD Rom and the cost of delivering the CD Rom to the client.
 The marginal cost to Computershare of producing a copy of the register on a CD Rom is less than $100 (my own calculation based on the evidence of Ms Guyer is that it is around $50).
