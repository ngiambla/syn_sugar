 Subrule (4) provides that subrule (3), which prescribes the calculation of an employer benefit, does not apply where at the time of a member's death he or she was absent without leave unless the Board is satisfied that the absence was due to "sufficiently mitigating circumstances".
 The Board's appeal from this decision as to interest was upheld by Kenny J on the ground that the decision under review by the Tribunal was that of the Incapacity Classification Committee, and that body did not have power to approve an increase, by an amount of interest, in the rate of pension payable.
 In order for the more favourable benefit to be payable there had to be a determination by the Board, or by the Tribunal standing in its place, that the deceased's absence was due to sufficiently mitigating circumstances.
