 A corporate defendant cannot invoke privilege on the grounds that an order or requirement to produce documents or information might tend to incriminate a natural person, such as a director: Microsoft Corporation v CX Computer Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 3 ; (2002) 116 FCR 372 at [32] - [33] (per Lindgren J) and ASIC No. 1 at [5]. 4.
 That is to say, compliance is not required " if the only source of the information is the director defendants and they are entitled to remain silent ": ASIC No. 1 at [5] (emphasis added).
 Of particular relevance to the current dispute, ASIC was ordered to (1) file and serve a list of proposed witnesses by 29 February 2008 and (2) to file and serve any affidavits upon which it intended to rely by 4:00pm on 28 March 2008.
 ASIC informed the Court that it would be late in filing the balance of its affidavit material and sought an extension until 7 April 2008 to file additional affidavits, including an affidavit from an expert geologist, Mr Onley.
