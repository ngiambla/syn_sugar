 That distribution may be influenced and affected as alleged by ' deals done prior to the election for the distribution of preferences '. 12 Mr Smith, in his submissions, made it very clear that in questioning whether there was a way of "unscrambling" election results, his case as set out in those alleged facts is that the Senate election is a complex system of preference votes that are ' non-lineal '.
 The minimum assertion necessary to constitute such a fact is one raising the matter or matters by which the election is likely to be affected ( Webster at 225 per Gaudron J; McClure v Australian Electoral Commission [1999] HCA 31 ; (1999) 163 ALR 734 at [23] ---[24] per Hayne J).
 In the present case there are no facts set out or assertions made in the petition as to the likely outcome of the election other than the possibility that, because of a preference deal, the quota or a Senate position may have been achieved for some other, unspecified, group.
 Accordingly the petition was held to be incurably defective and no proceedings could be had on it (at 140). 19 Accordingly, as the 40 day period has now expired, any amendment to the petition is not available as the petition does not comply with s 355(a) of the Act.
