 In the present case there are no facts set out or assertions made in the petition as to the likely outcome of the election other than the possibility that, because of a preference deal, the quota or a Senate position may have been achieved for some other, unspecified, group.
 Accordingly the petition was held to be incurably defective and no proceedings could be had on it (at 140). 19 Accordingly, as the 40 day period has now expired, any amendment to the petition is not available as the petition does not comply with s 355(a) of the Act.
