 For example, one of the declarations proposed by SFC is that, on the proper construction of the AMOU Agreement, SFC is not required to obtain the agreement of AMOU before giving notice of a ' significant roster change ' and introducing such roster change.
 The reference to ' significant roster change ' is presumably intended to be to the expression used in cl 7.5.3 of the AMOU Agreement. 54 On SFC's own argument, certain roster changes require the prior agreement of AMOU, namely those that incorporate terms inconsistent with the provisions of Annexure C to the AMOU Agreement.
 As I have noted, the virtues of ' Vessel Teams ' were expressly identified in cl 25.2 of the AMOU Agreement 2004, which also recorded that ' [SFC] and Officers [were] committed to working towards having self-managed work groups '. 63 Secondly , despite apparently having the power to introduce crew based rosters during the currency of the AMOU Agreement 2004, SFC did not do so.
 The first of these is cl 7.1.1, which commits the parties to work together to reach agreement on new rosters for the purpose of introducing the Annual Salary. 69 Eighthly , the AMOU Agreement records that SFC is committed to reviewing rosters on a regular basis and to meet with the Workplace Delegates Council to ' reach agreement on any proposed changes to the rosters ' (cl 7.1.3).
