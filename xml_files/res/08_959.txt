 Introduction and grounds of appeal 1 This is an appeal from orders of the Federal Magistrates Court made on 11 July 2007 dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('Tribunal'): SZJRW Anor v Minister for Immigration Anor [2007] FMCA 1099.
 On 19 October 2006, the Tribunal published its decision to affirm a decision of the delegate of the first respondent ('the Minister') to refuse to grant each appellant a protection visa under the provisions of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). 2 Appellant SZJRW, the primary appellant, is a citizen of the People's Republic of China ('China') who sought a protection visa based upon a contended well-founded fear of persecution on the ground of his participation in protests against the government of China, that is, by reason of his political opinion.
 The appellant says that the Tribunal inferred that there was no basis for any concern on the part of PRC authorities about the conduct and activities of the appellant as he and his wife were able to obtain passports with ease.
