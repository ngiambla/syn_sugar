 The Tribunal suggested that this may indicate that the appellant was of no interest to PRC authorities in China either by reason of his own conduct or by reference to the appellant's family's background including any view held about the appellant's uncles.
 The Tribunal concluded based on the identified independent country information and ease of departure to Australia that neither appellant would have been likely to have been granted passports or exit permits if either of them had been of any interest to the Chinese authorities.
 The appellant says that the Tribunal inferred that there was no basis for any concern on the part of PRC authorities about the conduct and activities of the appellant as he and his wife were able to obtain passports with ease.
 The appellant could not recall other activities with any precision. 53 In evaluating the facts concerning the appellant's protest activity in Australia, the Tribunal gave weight to the consideration that the appellant engaged in the primary protest event on 13 March 2006 immediately after arriving in Australia on 8 March 2006.
