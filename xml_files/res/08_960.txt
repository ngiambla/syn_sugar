 However, if the application is ' misconceived ' the position is very likely to be different: Standish v University of Tasmania (1989) 28 IR 129, at 139, per Lockhart J. 17 As I have recorded, SFC does not oppose an order for costs in favour of the second respondents in respect of SFC's application for interlocutory relief.
 It is to be remembered that the statutory criterion is whether a party to a proceeding has, by an unreasonable act (or omission), caused another party in the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding. 23 SFC's submissions also appear to assume that the relevant ' proceeding ' is SFC's application for a declaration as to the proper construction of the Enterprise Agreements.
 The answer to that question, in my opinion, must be yes, since the motions for anti-suit injunctions were made necessary by SFC's act. 25 Even if, contrary to my view, AMOU must show that SFC's unreasonable act was ' in connection with ' the proceedings seeking declaratory relief, in my opinion it has done so.
