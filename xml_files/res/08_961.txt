 It was an implied term of Mr Boyn's contract of employment that Schering, through its directors, officers and managers, "would act in a manner consistent with fidelity and good faith towards [Mr Boyn] in relation to the conduct of the contract" ( 16 ). 8 In 1984, Schering took steps to improve the level of superannuation benefits provided to its employees in order to take account of industry standards ( 17 ).
 In the present case, the statement of claim does not allege any discriminatory treatment by Schering of Mr Boyn as compared with Schering's treatment of other people after the Act commenced to operate on 23 June 2004. 39 I do not find it necessary to deal with Schering's second and third attacks on the statement of claim distinct from its first attack.
 Mr Boyn's complaint seems to be simply that Schering did not choose to make a "top up superannuation payment" that would have made the amount received by Mr Boyn equal to some unidentified amount payable to some unidentified person or group who were at some unidentified time younger to some unidentified extent than Mr Schering. 40 On my understanding of the facts, I do not think that the statement of claim can be amended so as to plead, in respect of superannuation, unlawful discrimination by Schering occurring after 23 June 2004 and falling within ss 14 and 18(2) of the Act.
