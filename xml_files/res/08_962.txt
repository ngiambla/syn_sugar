 With the exception of the decision of Austin J in ACCC v ASIC , these authorities support the proposition that on registration of a company, the liquidator who was in office at the time of deregistration is not automatically reinstated. 6 However, in Best v Yellow Express Carriers Limited [2004] NSWSC 666 , Young CJ in Eq took a practical view to the question.
 His Honour said that, in short, the question should be whether there would be a reasonable apprehension by any creditor of lack of impartiality on the liquidator's part in the circumstances by reason of prior association with the company or those associated with it, including creditors or, indeed, any other circumstance. 10 I do not need to determine whether it is necessary to strike such a balance or how that balance ought to be struck in the present case.
