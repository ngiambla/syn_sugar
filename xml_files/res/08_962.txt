 I do not intend to record what was said in those authorities, but the cases and relevant paragraphs are: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2000] NSWSC 316 ; (2000) 174 ALR 688 at [50] ; Ramantanis v G and M Excavations; v I and M Excavations [2003] NSWSC 1250 at [7] to [8]; Murray Halstead v CTS Quality Building Products Pty Ltd (in liq) [2006] NSWSC 1022 at [12] ; JP Morgan Portfolio Services Limited v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [2008] FCA 433 ; (2008) 65 ACSR 636 at [7] -[8], and [10].
 With the exception of the decision of Austin J in ACCC v ASIC , these authorities support the proposition that on registration of a company, the liquidator who was in office at the time of deregistration is not automatically reinstated. 6 However, in Best v Yellow Express Carriers Limited [2004] NSWSC 666 , Young CJ in Eq took a practical view to the question.
 His Honour said that, in short, the question should be whether there would be a reasonable apprehension by any creditor of lack of impartiality on the liquidator's part in the circumstances by reason of prior association with the company or those associated with it, including creditors or, indeed, any other circumstance. 10 I do not need to determine whether it is necessary to strike such a balance or how that balance ought to be struck in the present case.
 There is no difficulty with any of these conditions, but it is necessary to add to the draft orders that were submitted to me this morning by Mr Fernon an order that the plaintiffs pay ASIC's costs of $434, and I will so order. 12 I should add that condition 5 referred to in ASIC's letter requires that the liquidator notify ASIC upon conclusion of the winding up.
