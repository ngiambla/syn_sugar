 ASIC contends that the auxiliary verb phrase "may cause" should be read distributively so that it attaches to each infinitive and should be understood to mean "may cause to be begun and [may cause to be] carried on. " On this reading, ASIC could either begin proceedings, carry on proceedings, or do both.
 Here, the liquidators who commenced the proceedings wished to bow out (presumably due to cost and funding issues), but one can imagine circumstances in which ASIC might want to take over an action that has been started by a company that does not wish to cede carriage of that action to ASIC.
 There I observed (at 675) that the better approach to construing these provisions is to "enquire whether, having regard to the structure of the [relevant] Act, it was contemplated by Parliament that [the powers appendant provisions] could be used for the purpose for which it is now sought".
 ASIC submits that "[t]he fact that the words 'may cause' appear in each of [the] two subparagraphs before the provision that states what may be caused, supports [the] distributive effect" (ie that "may cause" should be understood to attach to both infinitives rather than the infinitive phrase as a whole).
