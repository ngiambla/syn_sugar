 It had relied upon the unusual level of publicity that its homes had generated as the basis for an inference that the respondent had access to at least its broad designs, if not its detailed plans.
 Nonetheless, there were some imponderables. 22 With regard to the Calderbank letter, the applicant submitted that the making of such an offer, and its rejection, did not of itself justify a special order for costs.
 To justify such an order, the respondent bore the onus of establishing that the rejection of the offer was "imprudent" or "plainly unreasonable": Black v Lipovac (by his next friend Lipovac) [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386.
 It also made an attempt to resolve this case without the need for a trial by its offer of 17 August 2007. 26 On the other hand, it would have been irresponsible of those advising the applicant to counsel surrender merely on the basis of assertions contained in correspondence from the respondent's solicitors.
