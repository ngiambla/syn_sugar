 The delegate had decided to do so on the basis that there was " no reasonable prospect of the complaint being resolved through conciliation . " Reasons for the decision were annexed to that letter. 4 On 11 July 2007 Mr Dunstan wrote to the President, the Honourable John von Doussa, expressing " dismay " at an absence of response to correspondence forwarded in April and June 2007.
 The basis upon which the Attorney-General sought to intervene was to avoid the prospect of the First, Second and Third Respondents having to " defend " their own conduct or decisions made: cf R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13; 29 ALR 289. 16 The circumstances in which the Attorney-General may exercise the right conferred by s 18(1) to intervene " on behalf of the Commonwealth " are not, however, confined to those in which named respondents may otherwise be placed in the position of having to defend their own decisions or conduct.
 Those differences may only serve to emphasise the importance of the Attorney-General having the ability to intervene " on behalf of the Commonwealth . " The right of intervention conferred by s 18(1) obviously should not be confined to those situations in which an Attorney-General has a right of intervention in private litigation.
