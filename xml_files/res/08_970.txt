 As noted earlier, LE 2003's claim for infringement of the "Liquid Engineering" mark was not formally made until the amended statement of claim filed on 22 October 2007, long after LE 2003 first became aware in April or early May 2003 that Edwards was trading using the "Liquideng" mark.
 That agreement provided that all intellectual property rights, including any trade mark rights in "Exit Rust" and "Fuel Set," would be transferred to LE 2003, subject to LE 2003's acknowledgement that its rights in those marks might not be accepted due to, among other things, attempts by Edwards to register them in his own name: cll 7.8, 16.10.
 There was also no evidence of an oral or written licensing agreement between Andrews and LEI (or LEL) in respect of the marks at issue. 47 Counsel for the respondent failed to demonstrate, whether by reference to authority or otherwise, the purported relevance of Andrews' testimony about his understanding of what it was that he had transferred to the company in 1996.
