 On 6 March 2008, Lloyd-Jones FM dismissed the proceedings and ordered Mr Croker to pay the costs of the Commonwealth. 5 In the meantime, on 4 December 2007 Mr Croker instituted proceedings that were ultimately the subject of Cowdroy J's judgment in which he claimed $200,000 based on, as his Honour found, the same facts as had been relied on in the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings. 6 The absurdity of this claim is self-evident from the damages sought, the basis for which Mr Croker never particularised.
 He found that identical circumstances prevailed except that Mr Croker had increased the amount of damages which he particularised as having been suffered. 8 His Honour pointed out that Mr Croker had led no evidence to suggest he might be impecunious or otherwise unable to pay the amount of security for costs ordered by Lloyd-Jones FM.
