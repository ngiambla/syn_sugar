 They came before Lloyd-Jones FM, who ordered Mr Croker to provide security for costs of the Commonwealth in the sum of $30,000 by 4.00 pm on 11 September 2007 and Mr Croker was also granted leave to file and serve an amended application by that date.
 On 6 March 2008, Lloyd-Jones FM dismissed the proceedings and ordered Mr Croker to pay the costs of the Commonwealth. 5 In the meantime, on 4 December 2007 Mr Croker instituted proceedings that were ultimately the subject of Cowdroy J's judgment in which he claimed $200,000 based on, as his Honour found, the same facts as had been relied on in the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings. 6 The absurdity of this claim is self-evident from the damages sought, the basis for which Mr Croker never particularised.
 He found that identical circumstances prevailed except that Mr Croker had increased the amount of damages which he particularised as having been suffered. 8 His Honour pointed out that Mr Croker had led no evidence to suggest he might be impecunious or otherwise unable to pay the amount of security for costs ordered by Lloyd-Jones FM.
 Mr Croker told Cowdroy J: "Your Honour, I found that there was a security for costs issue that was difficult for me to meet also the production of documents was being to be insisted which I thought were irrelevant relevant [sic] to the matter and I was really looking at the legal services directions, your Honour and my understanding is that they are enforceable under the Judiciary Act 1903 . " 9 The last reference was to the directions under s 55ZF of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) given by the Attorney General as to how litigation ought be conducted on behalf of the Commonwealth.
