 Those rules apply to beneficiaries who bring an action for the benefit of the trust estate: McDonald v Horn [1995] ICR 685; Laws v National Grid Plc [1998] PLR 295; In the Matter of the British Airways Pension Schemes [2000] PLR 311.
 The problem, however, is that this is not an action in which a trustee, or some other person in a position of responsibility for administering assets for the benefit of others, has come to court for guidance.
 In McDonald [1995] ICR at 696, Hoffman LJ instanced as an example a case that involved a dispute over the beneficial ownership of trust property which he described as akin to an interpleader and hence an action in which the beneficiary could have his costs paid on a common fund basis.
