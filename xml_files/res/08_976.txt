 The respondent seeks an order that the Court instruct the applicant's solicitors in Hong Kong on or before Wednesday, 25 June 2008 to send their respective files from 1999 to 2006 forthwith to Piper Alderman Lawyers, solicitors for the applicant and the second cross-respondent in these proceedings.
 It also would be important, in my opinion, for the respondent to know whether the applicant received advice generally in relation to the terms of the distribution agreement and insofar as that advice would impact upon the applicant's claim for rectification.
 The respondent also sought discovery of the applicant's continuing legal advice after the distribution agreement was entered into until 2006. 27 It said that the applicant claims that, acting upon the representations which are pleaded in paragraph 84A and following, the applicant did things which, if the respondent's contention as to the terms of the agreement is right, means that the applicant has suffered damage.
