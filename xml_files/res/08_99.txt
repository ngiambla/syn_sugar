 The order then made by his Honour was that the Applicant was to be kept in custody up to and including 15 February 2007: Republic of Finland v Tervonen [2007] FCA 2107. 4 On 15 February 2008 the Full Court of the Federal Court heard an appeal from the decision of Gyles J and an appeal from a further decision concluding that notices issued under s 16 of the 1988 Act were invalid ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589).
 In the present proceedings, neither the Republic of Finland nor the magistrates are such persons. 11 This difficulty could be overcome by the Applicant seeking a writ or an order in the nature of a writ directed to the appropriate Respondent.
 Albeit not the person who has the custody or control of the Applicant, the Republic of Finland has tendered a copy of the O rder For Arrest as made on 21 December 2007; a copy of the order made by Rares J on 24 December 2007; and a copy of the order made by the Full Court on 15 February 2008.
 In Re Officer in Charge of Cells, ACT Supreme Court; Ex parte Eastman [1994] HCA 36 ; (1994) 123 ALR 478 at 480, Deane J addressed the importance of the writ of habeas corpus and continued: It is not, however, available as a means of collaterally impeaching the correctness of a judgment or order made by a court of competent jurisdiction which is not shown to be a nullity.
