 It is sufficient to note that on 20 December 2007 Gyles J ordered that the Applicant be released from custody: Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067. 3 On 21 December 2007 an Application was then made by the Republic of Finland to the Duty Judge of this Court for the arrest of the Applicant.
 The order then made by his Honour was that the Applicant was to be kept in custody up to and including 15 February 2007: Republic of Finland v Tervonen [2007] FCA 2107. 4 On 15 February 2008 the Full Court of the Federal Court heard an appeal from the decision of Gyles J and an appeal from a further decision concluding that notices issued under s 16 of the 1988 Act were invalid ( Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 , 98 ALD 589).
 Albeit not the person who has the custody or control of the Applicant, the Republic of Finland has tendered a copy of the O rder For Arrest as made on 21 December 2007; a copy of the order made by Rares J on 24 December 2007; and a copy of the order made by the Full Court on 15 February 2008.
 Similarly, in the present proceedings, there is no reason to challenge the validity of the orders made on 21 and 24 December 2007 and the order made by the Full Court on 15 February 2008. 13 The Application for the writ therefore fails.
