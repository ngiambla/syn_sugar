 The Commissioner contended that he addressed the discretion conferred upon him by s 227(3) of the Assessment Act and made a decision not to remit any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant prior to the issue of the Notice of Amended Assessment on 29 July 2004.
 The applicant's submission that a consequence of the alleged invalidity of a decision by the Commissioner under s 227(3) not to remit additional tax which may be made in breach of one or other of the Hickman provisos 'taints and renders invalid the whole of the Notice of Amended Assessment' does not bear analysis.
 Any invalidity of a decision reached by the Commissioner in the exercise of his discretion under s 227(3) of the Assessment Act could not affect that part of the Notice of Amended Assessment which records the Commissioner's assessment of the applicant's amended taxable income ($5,936,606) and of the tax payable thereon ($2,780,806.82).
 The fact that an assessment of additional tax under s 227(1) of the Assessment Act may have been incorporated in the Notice of Amended Assessment of the applicant's amended taxable income and of the tax payable thereon could not affect the validity of the other parts of the Notice of Amended Assessment.
