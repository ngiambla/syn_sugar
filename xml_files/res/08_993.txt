 It further contends that the SFC Contract Condition would have or is likely to have the effect of lessening competition in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) and s 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Act . 4 The application for urgent injunctive relief arises in the following circumstances.
 The case did not concern s 45 of the Act . 7 The following condition is printed on each ticket for the Perth Test ("the Ticket Condition"): Sale of this ticket creates a contract between the ARU and the purchaser which gives the purchaser a transferable but conditional licence for admission to the specified match.
 By virtue of s 45(3) "competition" for the purposes relevantly of s 45 means competition in a "market". 37 CSA alleges that the market for the purposes of the operation of the Act , is and was, in respect of the Perth Test, the market in which the respondent supplies or is likely to supply Rugby Union test match tickets for re-sale in conjunction with corporate hospitality packages.
 The correspondence to which I have referred between the WAFC and the SFC and between the SFC and the ARU speaks in terms of the "providing" or "issuing" of tickets by the ARU to the SFC for sale to its members.
