 The appeal, which was the reason for the making of the stay order on 23 July 2009, was an appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court from orders made by Mansfield J on 15 January 2009.
 However, he now purports to rely upon the fact that he issued proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court as a reason for staying the orders made by Mansfield J on 23 July 2009.
 In my opinion, it would not be appropriate to stay the orders of 23 July 2009 made by Mansfield J, on the basis that the applicant wished to re-agitate in the Federal Magistrates Court the same issues which his Honour had disposed of on 15 January 2009.
 He said he had obtained information during the currency of those proceedings and the proceedings disposed of by Mansfield J on 23 July 2009 and under the Freedom of Information Act , which would allow him to challenge those decisions on other evidential bases.
