 His Honour noted that, during the continuation of this proceeding, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation had lost patience and had brought this application seeking an order that he be entitled to inspect the seized material.
 The applicant's draft notice of appeal, and indeed the applicant, during argument, continues to make the claim that he is entitled to claim legal professional privilege in respect of all of the documents seized under the search warrant.
 In the hearing before his Honour, Mr Nicholls' claim for legal professional privilege failed because he adduced no evidence in support of the claim that any of the documents were communications which were protected by legal professional privilege.
