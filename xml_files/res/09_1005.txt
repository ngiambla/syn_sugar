 The period for which documents were to be discovered was determined as long ago as Tamberlin J's first judgment on the question in October 2007.
 He said at [14] of that judgment that he was not satisfied "at this stage" that documents outside of the eight year period were "appropriate or necessary" for the purpose of ascertaining a benchmark.
 The applicants now rely on evidence of certain deficiencies in the material produced, and on further evidence from Professor Rubinfeld to support the widening of the period.
 Nevertheless, I do not consider that the documents identified in categories 7 and 8 are "necessary" within the terms of O 15 r 15 or Practice Note 14.
