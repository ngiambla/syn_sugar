 All of the parties recognise that these new claims are substantial and amount to a large amendment to the scope of the existing pleadings involving, as they do, allegations of fraud and misleading and deceptive conduct against a range of people who previously had no involvement whatsoever in the proceeding.
 The affidavit of Mr Oldfield establishes that the reason for the application for the amendment at this stage is that the solicitors for the respondents issued a subpoena on 14 May 2009 to FirstMac Limited.
 The information that became available through a close analysis of the documents produced under the subpoena in support of the allegations of fraud and misleading and deceptive conduct came as a surprise to the respondents.
 First, this is an application to amend a defence by a defendant, not, as in Aon , an application to amend by an applicant which already had the advantage of consent orders reached through a process of mediation.
