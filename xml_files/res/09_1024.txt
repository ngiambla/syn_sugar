 By notice of motion filed on 20 February 2009 the State moved for summary dismissal of the proceeding and on 20 March 2009 Emmett J dismissed the proceeding: Croker v Department of Education and Training (NSW) [2009] FCA 350.
 In the course of his reasons, his Honour said: [5] The first basis upon which the State seeks summary dismissal is that the institution providing the educational services that the applicant apparently sought is the Technical and Further Education Commission, a body corporate formed under the Technical and Further Education Act 1990 (NSW).
 The events/matters which in paras (4) and (6) of the applicant's affidavit sworn and filed on 8 July 2009 are, according to the respondent, bare chronological entries which do not inform one of their relevance to an explanation for the delay.
