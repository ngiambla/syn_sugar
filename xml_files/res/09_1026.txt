 The applicant, Super Choice Now Pty Ltd, as Corporate Trustee for The Julie Anne Barrow Charitable Trust ("The Charitable Trust"), seeks orders to set aside five separate creditor's statutory demands addressed to it for the respective amounts of $2,472,000, $536,666, $116,000, $100,000 and $2,385,000.
 Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated sufficient reason to warrant the exercise of the discretion under O 4 r14 in favour of the applicant so as to enable Mr Barrow to appear on the substantive application to set aside five statutory demands addressed to the applicant.
 The commercial and practical nature of the statutory process to set aside a statutory demand was explained by Young J in Classic Ceramic Importers Pty Ltd v Ceramica Antiga SA (1994) 13 ACSR 263 at 267 in the following terms: "...
 In these circumstances, I consider that the Court should take a more benevolent approach to the exercise of the discretion under O 4 r14 than it would in circumstances where the applicant was, in a practical sense, the moving party or the practical aggressor.
