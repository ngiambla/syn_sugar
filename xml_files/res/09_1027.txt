 Secondly, Annexure B to the notice to produce sets out the rights and obligations in s 29B(1) and (2) of the ACC Act, but does not set out the rights and obligations conferred or imposed by s 29B(3) and (4) of the ACC Act.
 The applicant was given notice of those matters and there is no evidence that he was misled by that part of the 2003 authorisation or determination which addressed the class or classes of persons who were to participate in the special investigation.
 Consideration of the opening words of the provisions of ss 29B(1) to (4) supports this distinction (that is, the fact that s 29B(1) uses the words "served, or otherwise given" whereas ss 29B(3) and (4) refer to persons to whom disclosure has been made or information disclosed).
