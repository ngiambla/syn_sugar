 The High Court of Australia has reversed the decision of the Full Court in SZKTI : see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI and Another (2009) 258 ALR 434.
 The appellant further submits that the Tribunal, in seeking information from the Australian Association was using that Association merely as an agent to obtain 'additional information' from the National Amir in Bangladesh.
 Further, the Tribunal's enquiry of the National Amir by its September 2007 letter was not a request for 'additional information' since the Amir had not previously been invited to provide information.
