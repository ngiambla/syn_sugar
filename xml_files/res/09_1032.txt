 Section 13 of the Act relevantly states that an interference with privacy occurs when: in the case of an act or practice engaged in by an agency (whether or not the agency is also a file number recipient, credit reporting agency or credit provider)---breaches an Information Privacy Principle in relation to personal information that relates to the individual[. ] Section 13 of the Act also identifies other conduct which will constitute an interference with privacy; however none is relevant to the IPPs or present circumstances.
 Not only must the personal information be information or an opinion about an individual, it must also have been obtained or created for the purposes of Ch 3 and Ch 4 of the HES Act.
 It cannot be said to be "personal information" within the meaning of s 179-5 as it evidently not gathered or created for the purposes of s 36-22, Ch 3 or Ch 4 of the HES Act.
