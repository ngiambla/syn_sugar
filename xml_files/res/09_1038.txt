 The contention of the applicant is that he is not obliged to answer such questions, and that the examiner is not entitled to ask such questions, because that would involve a real risk that the administration of justice would be interfered with.
 The examiner is obliged at the conclusion of an examination to give the head of the special ACC investigation or operation a record of the proceedings of the examination and any documents relating to it: s 25A(15).
 By that avenue, the CEO through the nominated head of the investigation or operation would be in receipt of the material which would enable the CEO to comply with s 12(1) of the ACC Act itself.
 That is a matter relevant to whether the ACC Act by necessary implication authorises questions, and obliges answers, in respect of which there is a real risk of interfering with the administration of justice.
