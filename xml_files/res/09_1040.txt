 The threats were made with intent to coerce Hardcorp to employ Mr Deans, Mr O'Donnell and Ms Singleton on the Mount Street project and, amongst other things, to allocate to Ms Singleton the responsibilities or duties of OHS officer at the site.
 Accordingly, the Court found that, on 17 February 2006, Mr Mates, in his own right, and the Union, through Mr Mates' conduct that day, breached s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act .
 On the morning of 21 February 2006, Mr Mates entered the Mount Street site, found the crane crew and shut down the crane by telling the crew to pack up and leave, which the crew ultimately did.
