 In that statement of claim dated 31 July 2009, the plaintiffs allege - and I here refer to paragraphs 50 to 57 of the statement of claim --- that over a period of time, the First, Second and Third Defendants caused the Second Plaintiff to pay to the Sixth Defendant an amount of some $2.23 million.
 It may readily be inferred that Mr Angeleri controlled the flow of funds from the Second Plaintiff's account to that of the Sixth Defendant and that he well knew that the Sixth Defendant was not entitled to the funds which had been transferred in the manner I have described.
 The moneys involved were obtained by the Tenth Defendant in substantially the same way as the funds obtained by the Sixth Defendant, namely the creation of fictitious loans which led to the drawing down of funds from the Second Plaintiff and the transfer of those funds, under Mr Angeleri's supervision, to the Tenth Defendant, of which he was one of three directors.
