 Because the application relates to decisions taken by the Trustee in that capacity, the application has been dealt with as well as if it were made under s 178 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).
 It is of the essence of bankruptcy, as provided for by the Act, that property which belongs to the bankrupt, including choses in action (other than those which are specifically exempted) are vested upon bankruptcy in the bankrupt's trustee.
 I am for present purposes obliged to accept the Court's ruling in relation to its characterisation of the proceedings in that case as "an action": Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 ; (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [135] .
