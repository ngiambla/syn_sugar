 This is an appeal from Federal Magistrate Burnett, who dismissed an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the AAT), which had affirmed the decision of Centrelink that the Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations was entitled to recover from the appellant, as a debt due to the Commonwealth, the amount of $3,021.50, being an amount that was overpaid to the appellant in relation to his Newstart Allowance.
 The appellant says that retirement benefits paid to him by the United States Social Security Administration (US Administration) should not have been taken into account when calculating his entitlement to Newstart Allowance in Australia.
 The appellant file and serve written submissions of no more than 10 pages by 4 pm, 10 clear working days before the date set for hearing of the appeal, together with any copies of any authorities upon which the appellant wishes to rely, with the relevant passages highlighted or otherwise marked.
