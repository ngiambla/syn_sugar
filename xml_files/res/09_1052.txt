 The reference to "the premises" is probably intended to include the allegations made in para 36 of the amended statement of claim that, on or about 1 October 2007, the respondent terminated the applicant's employment.
 That allegation is particularised by reference to a telephone call and an email from David Scott on behalf of the respondent on 23 May 2007, advising the applicant that the Australian assignment was being terminated and would expire on 1 October 2007.
 Breach of contract The remainder of the relief sought in the amended application, in the six subparagraphs of para 4, the two subparagraphs of para 5, and para 6, concerns claims arising out of the contract between the applicant and the respondent.
 In turn, by reference to paras 52 (to which I have referred in [37]) and 53, a claim is made in respect of the term of the contract alleged in para 25(s) of the amended statement of claim.
