 The Court has an important and continuing role in managing representative proceedings in the public interest to rectify any potentially misleading communications to class members or potential class members, in order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding engendered by such communications, particularly when they emanate from legal advisers, as to rights and obligations and procedures to be followed by recipients of such communications.
 I would respectfully add to his Honour's remarks that the Court's role is not merely enlivened when it is necessary to rectify potential misleading communications, but to monitor and prevent such potentially misleading communications if it is appropriate to do so.
 In Courtney v Medtel Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 957 ; (2002) 122 FCR 168 , Sackville J at [52] said: While s 33ZF(1) of the Federal Court Act should be given a broad construction, that does not mean it can or should become a vehicle for rewriting the legislation.
