 There is, therefore, a substantial public interest in ensuring that, if the respondents' allegations are accepted by the Court, the true perpetrators of what has occurred be identified by the Court and be made the subject of appropriate orders.
 The matter is one of discretion and the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate why it is more appropriate, in respect of a particular claim, to proceed by way of action: Fielding v Vagrand at 174; Ogilvie Grant v East at 744; Stewart v Intercity Distributors Limited (1960) NZLR 944 at 946.
 A grant of leave can be made subject to conditions directed at minimising interference with the orderly winding up of the company in liquidation: Oceanic Life Ltd v Insurance and Retirement Planning Services Pty Ltd at 1159.
