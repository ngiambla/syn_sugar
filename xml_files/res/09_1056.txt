 The third Tribunal said: ... the Tribunal finds that the applicants were not married, and the reason that the various applications indicated they were married was that this would facilitate the granting of the visas sought.
 What occurred on the remitter by the High Court to the second Tribunal is recorded in the judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith of 13 April 2006, on the occasion of the appeal from the decision of the second Tribunal to the Federal Magistrates Court.
 Further, having regard to a "dob-in" claim that the appellants are cousins once removed, the Tribunal said: ... the Tribunal finds that there is a strong likelihood that the DNA results supports the dob-in information, in the context that the (first) cousins index was 0.63.
 The Tribunal also became aware at the hearing before the third Tribunal of possible inconsistencies and unreliability in the witness' evidence. (Emphasis added) I have already referred to the Tribunal's treatment of the DNA evidence.
