 The purpose of cl 485.215(c) is to enable an applicant to demonstrate competent English after the time of application, provided the applicant has arranged to undergo a test to that end (that is, the end of demonstrating competent English).
 It is true that on meaning 2 an applicant cannot arrange and take a test before the time of application for fear of not obtaining a result of competent English in time.
