 Second, the applicant could establish the making of arrangements to undergo a language test (cl 485.215(c)), in which event the applicant also would have to establish competent English at the time of decision (cl 485.222).
 The purpose of cl 485.215(c) is to enable an applicant to demonstrate competent English after the time of application, provided the applicant has arranged to undergo a test to that end (that is, the end of demonstrating competent English).
 It is true that on meaning 2 an applicant cannot arrange and take a test before the time of application for fear of not obtaining a result of competent English in time.
 It is consistent with the wider context of the statutory scheme, specifically enabling an applicant to satisfy the criteria either by demonstrating competent English at the time of application or, provided the applicant has made the arrangement for a test, at the time of decision.
