 However, this still left lacunae where concepts inherent in estates or interests in or affecting land under the provisions of the RP Act were themselves not fully fleshed out or explained in that enactment: cf English Scottish and Australian Bank Ltd v Phillips [1937] HCA 6 ; (1937) 57 CLR 302 at 324 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ.
 In addition, given that now such disclaimers and vesting orders occur under laws of the Commonwealth, the question may arise as to whether any escheat or remaining interest in the property after a disclaimer should be treated as falling into the Crown in right of the Commonwealth rather than the State: cf Attorney-General of Ontario 8 App Cas 767.
 That is not necessarily inconsistent with the Crown, in the case of a disclaimer, before any order is made under s 133(9) of the Bankruptcy Act or s 568F of the Corporations Act , holding the land in trust for statutory purposes, namely pending the determination of the Court as to the person in whom the property should vest.
