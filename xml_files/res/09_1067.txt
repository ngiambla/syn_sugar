 The Tribunal concluded from all the circumstances that it could not be satisfied that the appellant would be active in the TMC or in politics if he returned to India.
 The Tribunal found that, although the appellant had sold his business in India, he was clearly a talented businessman who would continue his business activities if he returned to India.
 The Tribunal then turned to consider the questions of whether the appellant would be able to access adequate state protection in India and whether the appellant could relocate to another part of India to avoid persecution by the CPI(M).
