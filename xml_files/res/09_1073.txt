 On 27 May 2009 the New South Wales District Registrar of this Court, Mr Michael Wall, dismissed an application by the applicant to set aside a bankruptcy notice.
 The present application was made by notice of motion filed in Court on 2 September 2009 and also by interim application filed on 21 August 2009 pursuant to r 2.01(2) of the Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules 2005 .
 In dismissing the application the District Registrar was exercising a power delegated by the Court pursuant to s 35A(1)(h) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and r 2.02 of the Bankruptcy Rules.
 For example, an extension of time may be granted where the applicant has a strongly arguable case, even in the case of long delay for which the explanation is not strong.
