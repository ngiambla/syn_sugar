 The ACCC was of the view that Allphones was guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct in the negotiations with its franchisees which were then taking place as part of the dispute resolution process commenced by the service of the Notice of Dispute.
 In the covering letter, Phillips Fox said: These documents are provided to the ACCC on the same basis as to Confidentiality and Without Prejudice status as Allphones provided its Supplementary Statement of Position and Supporting Materials dated 16 October 2008.
 For clarity, Allphones acknowledges that: 13.1 acceptance of the Supporting Material on the above basis by the ACCC does not constitute an admission by the ACCC that the Supporting Material (or any part of it) is, in fact, without prejudice.
 The contents of the Phillips Fox letter concerning the alleged without prejudice privilege repeated the substance of the Phillips Fox letter dated 27 October 2008 written in respect of the Supporting Calculations Document.
