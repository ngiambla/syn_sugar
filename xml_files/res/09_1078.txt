 The first is an order that each party bear its own costs of the vacation, but that the applicant indemnify the respondents in respect of one half of the costs which they were ordered to pay in relation to the cross-defendant, namely, the professional indemnity insurer.
 The alternative position of the respondents is that the applicant should pay the respondents' costs thrown away by reason of the vacation of the hearing dates, albeit on the usual, and not an indemnity, basis.
 Accordingly, I make the usual order as to costs, namely, the respondents pay the applicant's costs thrown away by reason of the vacation of the hearing dates fixed for 7-11 and 17 September 2009, as agreed or taxed.
