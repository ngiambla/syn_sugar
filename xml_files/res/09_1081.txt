 Thirdly, cl 7.3(a) of the Constitution provides that: Despite anything else in this Constitution , the Responsible Entity is not entitled to any fees, recovery of costs or indemnity from Project Property in circumstances where the Responsible Entity has not properly performed its role under the Constitution or the [Corporations] Act.
 In relation to non-institutional scheme members, this is unrealistic given that in Australia civil proceedings, costs follow the event and thus the risk of an unsuccessful action is likely to be prohibitive to implementing proceedings. ...
 Clause 20.4 provided that HML could "on its own behalf or on behalf of any Applicant or Member commence and prosecute legal proceedings of any kind in any court in respect of the Project or any Member's Interest".
 For those reasons, I consider that Ch 5C of the Corporations Act read with the Constitution (including cl 20), was intended to, and does, empower HML to institute proceedings alleging claims for breach of contract and duty by a former responsible entity.
