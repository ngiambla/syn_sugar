 I accept Ms Chaloner's evidence that she did not purchase a 2009 diary following instructions from Ms Cummins not to do so, and her evidence that she had not entered bookings into an Excel spreadsheet for forward bookings for 2009.
 I have formed this view for the following reasons. "Break in" First, I am not persuaded by HFAT's contentions that Mr Rhys Thomas "broke into" the HFAT office at Hangar 5, Broome Airport on or around 21 April 2009, and improperly removed material he found there.
 The incongruity of such apparently important HFAT booking records being left unattended by Ms Cummins or Ms Bishop for such a long period of time is heightened by the fact that HFAT was not the only entity with an office in Hangar 5.
