 Some assistance as to the nature of the " hearing " to be given when an " objection " is taken may be gleaned from both the terms employed in O 39 r 10 and from authority.
 It is not considered that any inflexible formula can be provided as to the standard of reasons which may be desirable in support of any Certificate as to the " results of an inquiry ".
 The task of the Court when conducting a " hearing " of the present nature, however, is not a task of determining whether or not such reasons as have been provided may be adequate if judicial review were being sought of the Deputy District Registrar's decision.
 Given the constraint imposed upon the Deputy District Registrar when conducting her " inquiry ", namely that " [t]he appropriate time for the determination of questions of interest " was at a later date, this present submission need not be further considered.
