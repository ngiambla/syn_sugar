 The policy provides that the respondent "will pay [the applicant] ... for each week ... the loss of Average Weekly Turnover based upon Weekly Calculations adjusted and agreed".
 Recall that in respect of the April 2007 incident the applicant claims a loss of Turnover for the week ending 12 April 2007.
 As currently pleaded, the loss claimed in respect of the April 2007 incident is the same loss as is being claimed for the September 2006 incident and the November 2006 incident.
