 Article 3 of the distributorship agreement made express provision, as between Fujitsu Limited and Fujitsu Australia Limited, that the two parties to the agreement were to have the relationship of 'independent seller and buyer', the relevant Article disclaiming the establishment of any relationship of partnership or agency between the parties.
 The first respondent has also conceded that a prima facie case for negligent misstatement or omission entitling the applicant to common law damages, sufficient to meet the requirements of Order 8 rule 3(1)(c) , has been made out by the applicant.
