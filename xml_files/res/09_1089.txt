 Article 3 of the distributorship agreement made express provision, as between Fujitsu Limited and Fujitsu Australia Limited, that the two parties to the agreement were to have the relationship of 'independent seller and buyer', the relevant Article disclaiming the establishment of any relationship of partnership or agency between the parties.
 The final submission of the first respondent was to the effect that conduct engaged in by Mr Rixon in providing brochures about Fujitsu MPG3 hard disk drives and the making of representations in relation to them could not be said to be conduct engaged in on behalf of Fujitsu Limited.
