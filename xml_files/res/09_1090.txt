 Article 31 has three elements to which regard must be had: (a) the ordinary meaning of the terms of a treaty; (b) the context in which the terms are used; and (c) the purpose and objects of the treaty.
 These types of losses may be characterised as "concrete" (i.e. loss of life or personal injury and loss of or damage to property) and "abstract" (i.e. financial loss resulting from a "concrete" loss).
 This, I think, is clear, in the case of Art 2.1(b) from the nature of the claim with which that paragraph is concerned (delay in carriage) and, in the case of Art 2.1(c), because it deals with claims in respect of "other loss", that is, loss other than of the kind covered by Art 2.1(a) and Art 2.1(b).
