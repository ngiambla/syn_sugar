 The inference for which the ABCC contends is that the industrial action taken on 5, 6, 8, 24 and 25 June 2009 was based on two extraneous matters, not on health or safety, and certainly not on any concern about imminent risk to the health or safety of the employees on the Site.
 In relation to these issues, there is, as I have noted, no evidence of a complaint being made by any employee to Diploma or to an occupational, health and safety representative about the matters raised by the respondents.
 I am also satisfied, for the following reasons, that a prima facie case has been established that the building industrial action was unlawful industrial action for the purposes of s 37.
