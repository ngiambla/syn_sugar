 Second (at [60]-[62]), with respect to Jill Teeling, the Tribunal concluded that she was Christopher's dependant and would have continued to receive about $15,000 a year in support from him had he not died.
 As the Tribunal stated at [67]: The Tribunal is of the view that a fair and reasonable distribution of the death benefit would have taken into account all of the circumstances above, including the likelihood and quantum of future financial support.
 This reference to "all of the circumstances" indicates that the Tribunal did not exclude other relevant considerations in determining whether the trustee's determination resulted in a fair and reasonable distribution of the death benefit.
