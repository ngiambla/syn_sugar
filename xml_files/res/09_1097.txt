 For some time no documents were received from the supplier and Servier asked Apotex for the name, address and contact details of the supplier in order to pursue an application under the Hague Convention.
 There is no evidence filed by the supplier or by API as to the reasons why the supplier is concerned to maintain the confidentiality of its identity or why API regards the supplier's identity as confidential.
 It remains to be seen what, if any, application Servier makes and whether the weight of any evidence that Servier wishes to pursue is outweighed by the delay and inconvenience caused in the proceedings and to other parties.
 Servier has agreed that it is sufficient for Apotex to provide the information identifying the supplier that it seeks from the redacted documents, rather than unredacted versions of the documents.
