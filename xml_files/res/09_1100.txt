 The Applicants moved the Court by interlocutory process for orders that Mr Denis Angeleri deliver up and transfer to them two motor vehicles and pay to them $37,381.88 plus interest.
 In the circumstances it is appropriate that Mr Angeleri should be required to repay the amounts paid, plus interest, to his credit with Diners Club, the Commonwealth Bank and the sum paid into the joint account in the Westpac Bank.
 Mr Angeleri does not resist an order that he should pay the costs of the Applicants of and incidental to this application and an order to that effect will also be made.
