 Ms Martin attempted to deal with Stoten by submitting that Dowsett J had erred in that he had conceived of spousal privilege as an extension of the privilege against self-incrimination and concluded that, because the latter had been abrogated by the Act, spousal privilege had been too.
 It followed that since s 30 made no express provision to abrogate spousal privilege, in order for it to be abrogated by necessary implication there would need to be evidence of a clear and unmistakable intention on the part of the legislature (see HKSAR v Lee Ming Tee [2001] HKCFA 17 ; (2001) 4 HKCFAR 133 at [55] ).
 In particular, whether spousal privilege is derived from self-incrimination privilege, or is a separate and distinct type of privilege based, as Ms Martin submits, on the unity of the family, the ultimate purpose of both is to prevent the husband (in this case) being incriminated.
