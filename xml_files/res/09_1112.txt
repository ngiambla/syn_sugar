 It must have been very clear to the appellant at all times from late June or early July 2009 that, if the indulgences which it was seeking were to be granted to it, it would be on strict terms and that those terms would have to be religiously adhered to.
 The appellant has indicated that it requires several days of this Court's Full Court sittings in February 2010 for the hearing of its appeal yet it has failed to play its part in getting that appeal on for hearing in a timely fashion.
 I should add that my present view is that that undertaking became spent according to its terms when the appellant failed to provide the security for the respondents' costs of the appeal which it had been ordered to provide, that is to say, at 4.00 pm on 21 September 2009.
