 The position is clarified when regard is had to the particulars of harassment and coercion set out in the Statement of Claim which I have extracted in full at [19] above.
 The respondent submitted that the complaints made by the applicant in her Statement of Claim were that the respondent had unduly harassed her and had unduly harassed and coerced GPT.
 It was submitted that the quality of his conduct just does not fit the meaning of the expression " undue harassment " as used in s 60 of the Act.
