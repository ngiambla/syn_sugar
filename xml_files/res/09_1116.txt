 The Tribunal found that Mr Piotto refused to sign the Newstart Activity Agreement which was presented to him and that Mr Piotto made three alterations to the activity agreement which were not accepted by MatchWorks.
 Additionally, as noted in Piotto at [37]---[39], a failure to negotiate a Newstart Activity Agreement is not a reasonable excuse for refusing to enter into an agreement for the purposes of s 624(2)---(2B) of the Act.
 The respondent's ability to require Mr Piotto to sign a Newstart Activity Agreement Mr Piotto also contends that the Tribunal erred in finding that the respondent was able to require him to sign the Newstart Activity Agreement.
 The Newstart Activity Agreement was "inherently faulty" Mr Piotto also alleges that the Newstart Activity Agreement offered by MatchWorks was unreasonable and "inherently faulty" as it did not comply with s 606 of the Act.
