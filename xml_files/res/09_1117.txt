 It is the defendants who contend that the plaintiff did not enter Australia on 8 November 2001 for the purposes of the IGOC Act but that he was 'in Australia' for the detention purposes of s 189(2) of the Migration Act .
 Because of the definitions contained in the Migration Act , the effect of the defendants' pleading is that the plaintiff was 'in Australia' for detention purposes without having 'entered Australia' and without becoming subject to other provisions of the Migration Act .
 Accordingly it follows that the plaintiff did not enter the migration zone at Ashmore Reef and therefore did not 'enter Australia' within the meaning of the Migration Act and accordingly did not 'enter Australia at an excised offshore place'.
