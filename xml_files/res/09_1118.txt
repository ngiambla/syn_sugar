 On the balance of probabilities, Mr Arthur determined on the evidence before him that you did fail to treat Ms Barclay with respect and courtesy and failed to behave at all times in a way that upholds the APS Values and the integrity and good reputation of the APS.
 Whilst opportunities were afforded to Mr Lohse to make a statement in respect of the suspected breach of the Code of Conduct, he was not given the opportunity to make an oral statement in relation to the suspected breaches of the Code of Conduct after he made his written statement on 11 March 2008.
 Mr Lohse was not provided with copies of statements made by Ms Barclay and Mr Coloe or transcripts of interviews of Ms Barclay or Mr Hislop in relation to the conduct said to constitute breaches of the Code of Conduct, nor was he given an opportunity to be present when any oral interview of Ms Barclay or Mr Hislop took place.
 In the circumstances it is hardly surprising that the Secretary's Procedures for determining Breaches of the APS Code of Conduct provided that ' If the employee makes a written statement [within the requisite period of time] of being given the opportunity to do so, the employee must also be give the opportunity to make an oral statement in relation to the suspected breach'.
