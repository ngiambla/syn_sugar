 It is agreed that the actions of the second respondent, and the first respondent vicariously, in respect of the stop-work meeting constituted building industrial action within the meaning of s 36 of the BCII Act.
 In turn this building industrial action constituted constitutionally-connected action within the meaning of s 36 of the BCII Act, because it was taken by an organisation, and related to building work that was regulated by Commonwealth industrial instruments.
 By reason of the building industrial action being industrially-motivated action, constitutionally-connected action and action that was not excluded action, it constituted unlawful industrial action within the meaning of s 37 of the BCII Act.
