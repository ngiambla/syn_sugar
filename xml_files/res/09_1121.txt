 In relation to the second matter, the applicant claims that his Honour failed to consider and give effect to various principles or provisions of the DDA and that he erred in concluding that the DDA had no extra-territorial effect.
 In doing so the Respondent has unlawfully discriminated against me in the provision of goods and services and access to premises on the grounds of my disability and has contravened the Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport 2002.
 The applicant submitted that his Honour's conclusion, that ss 23 and 24 of the DDA are mutually exclusive and that the applicant could not rely on essentially the same conduct in a claim under two mutually exclusive sections, was an error of law.
 After reciting the terms of the claim in the original application, which are extracted in [2] above, his Honour said (at [124] and [128]): [124] In my view, the entirety of the Applicant's claim relates to his treatment at Mumbai Airport in India.
