 The third respondent has applied to the Court for an order that these proceedings be transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland or, in the alternative, to the Queensland District Registry of this Court.
 The application for an order transferring the proceedings to the Supreme Court of Queensland is made pursuant to s 5(4) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 (Cth).
 The application for an order transferring the proceedings to the Queensland District Registry of this Court is made pursuant to s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( the Act ) and the Federal Court Rules .
 During argument, Counsel for the third respondent frankly conceded that the basis upon which he sought to have the matter transferred to the Supreme Court of Queensland did not justify the making of that order.
