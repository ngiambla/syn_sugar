 His judgment was expressly approved in the last appeal to the Privy Council from the High Court of Australia: Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Limited v Salmond Spraggon (Australia) Pty Limited (" The New York Star ") (1980) 144 CLR 300 at 305.
 Where there may be an issue about the capacity in which a stevedore is acting, namely, whether in truth it was the appointed agent of the carrier for the purposes of loading or discharge from a vessel, it is a commonplace and very simple for the stevedore who wishes to rely on a Himalaya clause to put the complete facts concerning its capacity before the cargo interest seeking to allege liability against it.
 It has been almost a tradition in the past in cargo claim litigation to protract sterile, pointless disputes unnecessarily that could be resolved easily by one or both parties laying its forensic cards on the table at the beginning of the proceedings or before they are commenced.
