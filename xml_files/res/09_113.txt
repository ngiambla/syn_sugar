 The Authority concluded as had the Tribunal in Ranallo [2008] AATA 533 , that the total number of hours worked by the six medical practitioners practising at the Centre throughout the relevant period was less than the requisite number of hours.
 The parties accept that the sole question is whether or not the Authority erred in concluding that the phrase 'equivalent of' in par 3(a) of item 112 of Sch 1 of the Rules can relate only to full-time working hours and may not relate to, or include consideration of, work output, including the number of patient attendances and medical services.
 The combined effect of ss 9 and 10 of the Rules is that, relevantly, if the Authority is not satisfied as to the following circumstances, it must recommend approval not be given: 112 Relocation to large medical centre 1.
