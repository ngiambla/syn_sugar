 In addition, he has deposed to the fact that at all material times RCR has complied with the provisions of Ch 2M (financial reporting requirements) and s 674 CA (continuous disclosure requirements) as they applied to RCR; there was and is no excluded information as defined in s 708A(7) CA which would have been required to be disclosed or now requires disclosure and, accordingly it is submitted by RCR, that no injustice will have been caused to any person by reason of the Notice not having been lodged within five business days of the shares being issued.
 Also central to the relief sought by this application is the fact that RCR would have been exempt in respect of the requirements under s 708A(5) CA in respect of the on-sale of the shares had it given a notice for the purpose of s 708A(5)(e) CA within five business days of the issue of the shares.
 The declaratory relief sought by RCR under s 1322(4)(a) CA to the effect that a notice given under s 708A(5)(e) CA within the extended period be deemed to take effect as if it had been given on 13 July 2009, that is, within the required five business day period, is consistent with relief granted in the matters of Charter Hall Limited, in the matter of Charter Hall Limited [2007] FCA 1316 , Diversified, in the matter of Diversified United Investment Limited ACN 006 713 177 [2008] FCA 720 and In the Matter of Chameleon Mining NL [2009] NSWSC 660.
 The notice under s 708A(5)(e) of the Corporations Act 2001 given to ASX Limited in respect of the relevant securities within the period provided for in order 1 be deemed to take effect as if it had been given to ASX Limited on 13 July 2009.
