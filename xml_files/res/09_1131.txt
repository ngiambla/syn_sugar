 The applicant bore the onus before the delegate and bears the onus on appeal of establishing use of the trade mark in accordance with s 100 of the Act.
 Pursuant to s 7(3) of the Act, any "authorised use" of a trade mark by another person is taken to be a use of the trade mark by the relevant owner.
 I am satisfied that it is appropriate to maintain the registration to the extent that it relates to footwear but not to maintain the registration with respect to the remaining goods.
