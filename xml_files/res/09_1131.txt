 The delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks upheld an application by the respondent for removal of that trade mark from the Register on the ground of non-use pursuant to s 92(4)(b) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) ('the Act').
 In his evidence, Mr Shen annexes copies of business records of the company, including commercial invoices, bills of lading, shipment advice, and tax invoices, relating to two shipments of footwear within the relevant period.
 The second shipment was purchased on 15 February 2006 and those shoes, also bearing the trade mark, were sold from 13 March 2006 to 14 March 2006 to customers in Victoria and New South Wales.
