 The first issue before the Tribunal was whether the applicant was "unemployed" within the meaning of that term in s 593(1) of the Act between 24 July 1998 and 4 May 2006.
 The Tribunal found that the intensity or level of the applicant's activities for the period from 1 July 2001 to 31 December 2005 was such that he was not "unemployed" within the meaning of that term in s 593(1) of the Act.
 The Tribunal addressed an assertion by the respondent that the applicant had a business relationship with a Michael Stockton during the relevant period and that that meant he was not "unemployed".
 The Tribunal found that the applicant's evidence was unconvincing and unreliable and that, in his evidence and exhibit R2, he significantly under-estimated the time he spent on the vehicle-related activities.
