 The first notice of motion is a notice of motion issued by the first two respondents in Peter John Humphries v Newport Quays Stage 2A Pty Ltd, MC Marina South Ltd and Rebecca McFarlane (SAD 153 of 2008).
 Paragraph 56 of Ms Humphries' Statement of Claim The respondents seek an order that paragraph 56 of Ms Humphries' Statement of Claim be struck out on the ground that it is embarrassing and has a tendency to cause prejudice and delay.
 The respondents complain that the plea in paragraph 56 fails to disclose the information Mr Humphries conveyed to Ms Humphries before she entered into the relevant transactions and fails to plead how and when that information was conveyed to Ms Humphries by Mr Humphries.
 In the course of submissions, counsel for Ms Humphries made it clear that she was not asserting that Mr Humphries passed on to her what he had seen and been told but rather, that he made a recommendation that she enter into the property contracts.
