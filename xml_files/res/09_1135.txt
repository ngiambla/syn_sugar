 Paragraph 56 of Ms Humphries' Statement of Claim The respondents seek an order that paragraph 56 of Ms Humphries' Statement of Claim be struck out on the ground that it is embarrassing and has a tendency to cause prejudice and delay.
 The respondents complain that the plea in paragraph 56 fails to disclose the information Mr Humphries conveyed to Ms Humphries before she entered into the relevant transactions and fails to plead how and when that information was conveyed to Ms Humphries by Mr Humphries.
