 The notice in question identified the land and drew the reader's attention to the fact that under the Native Title Act , there can be only one determination of native title for a particular area, so that if a person with any native title right or interest did not become a party, there may be no other opportunity for the Federal Court in making its determination to take into account those native title rights and interests.
 In addition, both the first respondent (the Minister for Lands) and the second respondent (NTSCORP Limited) have filed notices indicating that pursuant to s 86G of the Native Title Act , they do not oppose orders in or consistent with the terms sought by the applicant, namely that no native title exists in relation to the land.
 It provides that: (1) If, at any stage of a proceeding in relation to an application under section 61 , but after the end of the period specified in the notice given under section 66: (a) the application is unopposed; and (b) the Federal Court is satisfied that an order in, or consistent with, the terms sought by the applicant is within the power of the Court; the Court may, if it appears appropriate to do so, make such an order without holding a hearing or, if a hearing has started, without completing the hearing.
 In this case, the application is unopposed, and I am satisfied that an order as sought by the applicant is within the power of the Court and that it is appropriate to make such an order generally in the terms sought by the applicant.
