 In addition, both the first respondent (the Minister for Lands) and the second respondent (NTSCORP Limited) have filed notices indicating that pursuant to s 86G of the Native Title Act , they do not oppose orders in or consistent with the terms sought by the applicant, namely that no native title exists in relation to the land.
 In this case, the application is unopposed, and I am satisfied that an order as sought by the applicant is within the power of the Court and that it is appropriate to make such an order generally in the terms sought by the applicant.
