 His Honour held that the Tribunal was entitled to look at the whole of the circumstances in which an applicant leaves his or her home, when considering an application under s 1061JH(1)(a).
 The extensive further material that has been provided by Ms Budd serves only to confirm that she is seeking to invite the Court to canvass the factual conclusions reached by the AA Tribunal.
