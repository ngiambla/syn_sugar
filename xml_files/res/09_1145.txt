 The company notes that the applicants allege that payment by the company of the respondent directors' costs of defending these proceedings is impermissible on the sole ground that it is contrary to s 212(2) of the CA.
 The company says the only relief apparently sought in relation to this allegation is that in [B](c) of the substituted application by which the applicants seek as interlocutory relief that the company be restrained from paying the costs or otherwise financially assisting the respondents until further order or trial.
 The company points out that the question is obviously of great importance to it, in that it constitutes an allegation of "continuing impermissible related party, oppressive and unfair transactions" and is apparently directed to terminating any payments to the respondent directors pursuant to pre-existing indemnities.
