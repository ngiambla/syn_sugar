 His Honour gave extensive reasons for judgment, and in doing so had regard to these contentions and the general nature and history of the litigation: see Ibrahim v Highline and Ibrahim v Worken Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FMCA 510 (10 July 2009 judgment).
 Under the heading "The Magistrate double standard", the applicant deposes that the Magistrate was "biased and has a double standard" when he ordered the applicant to produce drawings that would be relied upon by the applicant in the proceedings, to the respondent, within 24 hours.
 At [37] and [38] of the judgment dated 10 July 2009, the Federal Magistrate stated: The applicant then sought to raise an issue involving the Worken matter, which was not listed before the Court that day.
