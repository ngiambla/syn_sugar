 The only places that the concept of " aggravation of an ailment " were mentioned at all in the Tribunal's Reasons was at [5] (when s 4 of the Act was extracted) and at [60].
 The language used by the Tribunal in the second dot point in [3] of its Reasons also suggests that the Tribunal did not have under consideration the question of aggravation.
 That is to say, the proposition being addressed in that paragraph of the Tribunal's Reasons is: Was the onset of the applicant's condition caused by or materially contributed to by the applicant's employment by Centrelink?
