 In November 2001, Wealthcare determined to place the York Street Promissory Notes and the Market Street Promissory Notes (the 'Promissory Notes') on Wealthcare's notional approved product list and they remained on the approved products list thereafter.
 Wealthcare did not rely on the representations made in the PIR reports as to whether or not the Corporations Act applied to the Promissory Notes when making the recommendation to extend in November 2003.
