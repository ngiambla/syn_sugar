 In November 2001, Wealthcare determined to place the York Street Promissory Notes and the Market Street Promissory Notes (the 'Promissory Notes') on Wealthcare's notional approved product list and they remained on the approved products list thereafter.
 Looking at the Information Memoranda, and the PIR reports themselves, the alleged misrepresentations concerning the Corporations Law are by their very nature no more than a restating of the information in the Information Memorandum.
 Wealthcare did not rely on the representations made in the PIR reports as to whether or not the Corporations Act applied to the Promissory Notes when making the recommendation to extend in November 2003.
 I have come to the view that Mr Roberts' evidence was so unreliable and lacking in credibility that it does not provide a sufficient basis upon which Wealthcare can satisfy its burden of proof to prove reliance upon the alleged misrepresentations in the PIR reports.
