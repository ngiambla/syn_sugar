 An order in the nature of a Mareva injunction in support of a costs order, and even a costs order prior to taxation of costs, is not unprecedented: see Commissioner of State Taxation West Australia v Nechold Pty Limited (1995) 30 ATR 69 at 72(a); see also Jetwest Limited v Haddican (1992) 2 All ER 545 at 548(g).
 As befits any applicant for ex parte relief, and especially an authority of the Commonwealth, there has been, commendably, full disclosure, both of matters going to jurisdiction, as well as discretion for and against, in the submissions made this afternoon.
 The applicant will not, without leave of the Court, seek to enforce this order in any country outside Australia or seek in any country outside Australia an order of a similar nature or an order conferring a charge or other security against the respondent or the respondent's assets. [1] For example, if the respondent pays money into Court or provides security, as provided for in paragraph 12 of this Order.
