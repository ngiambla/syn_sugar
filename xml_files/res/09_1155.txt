 Rule 5(2) provides for the filing by the Commissioner of, inter alia, an appeal statement within 28 days after a sealed copy of an application initiating the taxation appeal is served upon the Commissioner.
 In the amended appeal statement, which was filed on 15 September 2009, the following allegation, materially, is made at para 65: The purported Participation Agreement was not genuine, but merely a sham and an attempt to disguise the true situation.
 Whatever might be the tenor of that correspondence, it was not known to the Court, nor for that matter, did it have the formality of a statement made in open court by counsel on behalf of, in this case, the Commissioner.
