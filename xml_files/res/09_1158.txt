 A problem has arisen because of the interaction of s 249H(1) of the Act and provisions of the Company's constitution (Memorandum and Articles of Association) relating to the nomination of persons for election as directors at an AGM.
 Clause 67 of the Articles provides that a notice sent by post is deemed to have been served on the day following posting (the replaceable rule expressed in s 249J(4) of the Act does not apply because the Company was registered before 1 July 1998 and did not repeal its constitution after that date --- see s 135 of the Act).
 On the basis that "service" is to be equated with the "giving" of notice and that cl 67 applies in the context of s 249H(1), notice of the AGM to be held on 13 November would be required to be posted no later than 21 October 2009 so that it would be deemed to be given on 22 October 2009.
