 A problem has arisen because of the interaction of s 249H(1) of the Act and provisions of the Company's constitution (Memorandum and Articles of Association) relating to the nomination of persons for election as directors at an AGM.
 Clause 67 of the Articles provides that a notice sent by post is deemed to have been served on the day following posting (the replaceable rule expressed in s 249J(4) of the Act does not apply because the Company was registered before 1 July 1998 and did not repeal its constitution after that date --- see s 135 of the Act).
 Apparently the members of the Company reside in New South Wales, perhaps all in the Sydney metropolitan area, and on the basis that this provision rather than cl 67 applies, I am prepared to infer that again the day following the day of posting would be the deemed date of service.
 In other words, it would be possible, at least consistently with the letter of the constitution, for invitations to be sent only one week prior to the closing date for nominations provided that the closing date was no later than 21 days before the date of the AGM.
