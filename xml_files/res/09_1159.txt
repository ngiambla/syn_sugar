 On 30 December 2002, Mrs Yap made an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court seeking, inter alia, to set aside the judgment of the Full Court of 4 December 2002.
 That was also summarised in Granich v Yap [2004] FCA 1567 at [4] : On 11 October 1997, Granich Associates caused a bankruptcy notice to be served on Mrs Yap.
 On 13 May 1998, Mrs Yap filed a notice of intention to oppose the petition based on a pending application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia in relation to her unsuccessful professional negligence action against Granich Associates.
