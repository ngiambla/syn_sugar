 The authorities are collected there for the proposition that where the statement of monopoly does not identify particular features of shape or configuration of the design, the design applies to the appearance of the article as a whole and issues of infringement are to be approached with that in mind.
 It is another thing altogether to say that the registered owner should not be held to such a statement of novelty when the court comes to consider what aspects of the registered design are new or original.
 The document set out the statement of novelty, and said that the design was commercially known "as a single-sided 'posture top' type of design --- where a separate thin sprung layer is attached to the top of the main mattress to create a composite structure".
 The visual similarity to the registered design is not striking in its immediate impact, but it is, in my view, quite obvious, and the representation of the infringing bed does not show any readily apparent differentiating features.
