 The Applicant applies for orders under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act") requiring the First Respondent and the Second Respondent, whom the evidence satisfies me also resides at the property, to vacate the property within 21 days so that it may be sold and the proceeds made available to the creditors of the First Respondent.
 When the Trustee first moved to sell the property, the Second Respondent made offers, through a solicitor, to purchase the property, but those offers did not bring a sale to fruition, largely because the Second Respondent did not provide the necessary documentation, and in addition, there was an issue as to the adequacy of the sum offered by way of a proposed purchase price.
 It is plainly necessary that the Applicant be in a position to provide any purchaser of the property with vacant possession in order to facilitate a sale, and it is also necessary, in order to achieve that end, that the property be placed in such a condition that it may be attractive to a potential purchaser.
