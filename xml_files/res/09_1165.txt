 Mr Lelleton deposes that he completed the Statement of Affairs on 19 April 1995 and, on or about that day, posted the document to the Registrar in Bankruptcy at 450 Little Bourke Street, Melbourne.
 Mr White subsequently filed an affidavit in the earlier proceeding, VB 737/95, deposing that he had not been able to contact Mr Lelleton and that he had no details of Mr Lelleton's estate.
 Mr White has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court and advised that he neither objects nor consents to the orders sought by Mr Lelleton being made.
