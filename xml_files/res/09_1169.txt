 Mr Young contends, however, that in the exercise of its discretion the Court should not make a sequestration order because of a claim that he makes against ICM which is the subject of pending litigation (see below).
 A declaration that by engaging in all or part of the ICM Conduct, ICM had and received the Sale Amount to AAC's own use and benefit and that ICM is required to account for or pay by way of restitution the Sale Amount, alternatively some other amount to be determined.
 By this document AAC purported to assign to Mr Young the benefit of, and the right to enforce, any judgment or order (including any order for costs) in favour of AAC in the 2007 DC Proceeding (including if that proceeding was transferred to another Court).
