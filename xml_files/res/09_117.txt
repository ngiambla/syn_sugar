 The applicant ("Blue Chip Development") appears from its statement of claim to have entered into a contract with the second respondent ("Flea's Concreting") to carry out some contract concreting works.
 The constitutional matter said to be raised by the proceedings in this Court is to the effect that certain provisions in the BCIP Act are invalid for reason of inconsistency with s 22 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 In my view, there is no sufficient foundation for this Court to interfere, at this point in time at least, with the operation of the statutory scheme established by the BCIP Act.
