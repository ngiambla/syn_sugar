 The statement in the warrant of those matters required by s 3E(5)(a) and (c), and the requirement that a copy of the warrant be made available, ensure that the occupier or other person is not reduced to a mere bystander.
 But that authority also remains confined by the requirement that there be " reasonable grounds " for the belief that is formed and by the requirement that the thing seized be " in relation to another offence that is an indictable offence ".
 Disturbingly, no reference is there made to any discussion as to the terms and conditions of the warrants and the extent of the authority to search and to seize which was conferred by reference to those terms and conditions.
 Reliance upon s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') may not present such a problem for the Applicants --- but reliance upon s 39B could not permit review of the decision of the " issuing officer " to issue the warrants, that officer not being an " an officer ... of the Commonwealth ".
