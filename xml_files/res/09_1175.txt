 Having inspected the 15 reports and having read them carefully, I am firmly of the view that none of them could be tendered in evidence pursuant to s 69 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) ( the Evidence Act ).
 As I pointed out in AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 , AWB is not mentioned in any of the reports, only one document refers to any Australian company or entity and none of the documents specifies the wheat trade, with one exception.
