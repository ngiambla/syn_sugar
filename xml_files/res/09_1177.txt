 The words "relating to" are very broad and it is possible, in the commercial relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee, that a claim that relates to the operation of one of their businesses may well "relate to" the operation of the other.
 The damages are not particularised in the amended statement of claim, however, each of the claims relates to deficiencies in Ideal's support for the Nicolas in their operation of the franchise.
 I would accept that such claims probably do not "arise out of" the operation of the franchised business but it is difficult to see why they do not "relate to" that operation.
