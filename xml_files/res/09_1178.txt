 This is an urgent application by John Holland Pty Ltd to vacate the dates set for trial which is due to commence next Monday, 12 October 2009 and proceed for four days.
 He says that will occur because, in that event, the Union will have obtained discovery of the documents relevant to the collateral challenge, documents which he says are particularly sensitive in commercial terms.
 It follows, at its highest, that if this trial proceeds, John Holland will have to contend with an issue during the trial, and before the trial make discovery of documents, where it may not have to do so if it were able to obtain leave; and a stay; and then succeed on the appeal.
