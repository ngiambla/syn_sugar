 The Seventh Respondent, Mr Geoffrey Singh, is President of the NUWQ; he is an employee of Golden Circle and he is a member of both the NUW and the NUWQ.
 The Applicant seeks to distinguish the position of the Tenth and Eleventh Respondents from the Third Respondent because the former are now paid officials of the NUWQ who are actively seeking to represent persons who were previously members of both organisations.
 This was convenient because the Queensland branch of the NUW and the NUWQ had the same office bearers, operated out of the same offices, and acted as if they were a single entity.
