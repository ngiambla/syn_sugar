 The appellant appeals against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 3 October 2008: MZXTA v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1201 , dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") on 26 October 2007.
 On 13 August 2007, the Tribunal sent a letter to the appellant (via facsimile transmission to the authorised recipient) advising him that the hearing had been adjourned until 17 August 2007.
 Insofar as the appellant is nevertheless still contending that the Tribunal did not apply properly ss 425 and 426 in failing to reschedule the hearing so as to enable the appellant to attend a hearing and respond to the s 424A letters, I reject that submission.
