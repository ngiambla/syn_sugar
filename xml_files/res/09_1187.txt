 It follows that the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is no reason to believe that the visa applicant does not continue to satisfy the primary criteria for the grant of a subclass 421 visa at the time of the Tribunal's decision, so the visa applicant does not satisfy clause 421.230 of Schedule 2 to the Regulations. " THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S DECISION The ground pressed before the Federal Magistrate was that the Tribunal misconstrued or misunderstood clause 421.230 by failing to take into account that the appellant, as a holder of a sport visa subclass 421 visa at the time of the application, had already established that he had an established reputation in the sport and that the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question or identified the wrong issue.
 One type of sports visa applied to a person who was not the holder of a sports visa at the time of the application; the other type of sports visa applied to a person who was the holder of a sports visa at the time of the application for a further sports visa.
 The respondent further submitted that for this particular appellant to satisfy the relevant primary criteria, being subclause 421.222(4), and therefore to satisfy clause 421.230, the decision-maker at the time of the decision, had to be satisfied that there is no reason to believe that the appellant does not continue to establish that he has an established reputation in the field of sport.
