 The Federal Magistrate found as misconceived the appellant's claim that the Tribunal failed to clarify what the appellant was saying given its view that the appellant's explanations about the protest incident were vague.
 The Federal Magistrate considered the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal and concluded that it showed that the Tribunal properly explored with the appellant apparent inconsistencies put forward by him and the protest incident.
