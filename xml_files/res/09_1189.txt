 I am fortified in that conclusion by the opinion of Mr Sharma on behalf of Deacons and the fact that there was a mediated outcome during which the Deacons clients were represented by senior and junior counsel.
 Airservices contends that the publication of the global settlement sum would be embarrassing and misleading because there are other employees of Airservices, who are not part of the Deacons clients group, who may be subject to contracts of employment similar to the Contract but who do not allege representations by Airservices.
 Further, Airservices says that it is reasonable to assume that one of the factors taken into account in determining the settlement was the fact that the settlement would be accompanied by a deed of confidentiality.
