 The requirements imposed by s 29 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) that the matters there identified must be " specified " may well permit less room for imprecision in the identification of documents than that embraced by the Full Court (for example) in Pyneboard .
 There is no express requirement, for example, that a notice issued under s 29 identify on its face the particular ambit of the " special ACC operation/investigation " in respect to which the " document or thing " is considered to be " relevant ".
 Where however the notice is addressed to one person, requiring him to produce the documents of another, the notice must show that those documents relate to the income or assessment of a particular person, who must be identified.
