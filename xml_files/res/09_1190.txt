 Lehman Bros argued that under r 2.13 of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 , its liability was limited to any additional costs that were incurred by the Councils, until it was joined as a defendant at its own request on 16 July 2009.
 During the hearing on that day its counsel recognised the likelihood that Lehman Bros would become a party and argued in anticipation that it would put its own substantial case forward in the litigation.
 This is because it became a party to the proceedings and the costs that are both payable to it and by it are costs of the proceedings within the meaning of s 1335(2).
 I am satisfied that much, if not all, of the documents and work claimed by Lehman Bros in respect of the subpoena would have been incurred had discovery been ordered.
