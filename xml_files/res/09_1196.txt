 The parties have come to an agreement regarding the Court's reception of such material, subject to the exercise of the Court's discretion (TS 12 October 2009 p 2 ll 25-33 and p 3 ll 19-21).
 I consider that in the context of these particular proceedings this material would be of some assistance in understanding the background to these proceedings: cf North J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 700.
