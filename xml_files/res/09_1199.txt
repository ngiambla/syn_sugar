 On the same day, St George appointed Messrs D Winterbottom and M Brereton of Korda Mentha (Receivers) as receivers and managers of DCL and of the other 18 companies within the Destra Group in respect of which St George held security.
 On 19 February 2009 the creditors resolved to adjourn the second meeting in order to allow time for creditors to consider the foreshadowed DOCA. (Five companies failed to obtain a quorum of creditors at the second meeting, and it was the administrators who adjourned the second meeting of the creditors of those companies).
 However, the DOCA proposal was conditional upon the plaintiffs, St George and the companies in the Destra Group executing full releases in favour of Prime, the Destra Group and the directors and associates of the members of the Destra Group.
