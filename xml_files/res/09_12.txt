 Nor did the respondent take me to the documents; for its part, it relied on the oath of discovery and submitted that the applicant had not shown grounds to believe that relevant parts of the documents had been masked. 21 Under the Rules of Court there is express provision for an order for general discovery and for an order for limited discovery.
 Furthermore, it is said that the document was not retained and that the questions in whose possession, custody or power and where the document now is, are not applicable. 35 During a hearing on 11 December 2008, counsel for the respondent gave an explanation of what the respondent understood had happened to these two documents. 36 Counsel for the applicant put two submissions in relation to the documents.
 In my opinion, the Further Amended List of Documents complies with the Rules dealing with the contents of a list of documents and there is nothing in counsel's explanation which leads me to think otherwise. 37 Counsel for the applicant's other submission was that it was likely that the respondent had taken copies of the documents and the copies should have been discovered by the respondent.
