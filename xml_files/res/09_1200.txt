 The State argues that: The alternative position of the State is that it is highly implausible that the Yaburara/Mardudhunera People could establish native title over Dampier given that Nicholson J found in Daniel and determined in Daniel v State of Western Australia [2005] FCA 536 (Daniel Determination) that native title does not exist on the Burrup peninsula which surrounds Dampier on all sides.
 Existence of native title Native title does not exist in relation to the following parts of the Determination Area: (a) the ' Burrup ' (as described and depicted in the First Schedule); (b) ' Offshore Waters ' (as described and depicted in the First Schedule); (c) ' Depuch Island ' (as described and depicted in the First Schedule); (d) the ' Hamersley Ranges Area ' (as described and depicted in the First Schedule); (e) the ' Total Extinguishment Area ' (as described and depicted in the First Schedule).
 Subject to paragraph 2 above, native title rights and interests exist in the following parts of the Determination Area: (a) ' Ngarluma Native Title Area ' (as defined in the First Schedule); and (b) ' Yindjibarndi Native Title Area ' (as defined in the First Schedule), including the ' Section 47A Area ' and the ' Section 47B Area ' (as described in the Fifth Schedule) in respect of which extinguishment is disregarded in accordance with sections 47A and 47B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth).
