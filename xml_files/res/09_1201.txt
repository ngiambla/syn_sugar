 Just as Risk had determined the critical society issue by finding that the relevant society did not exist, Daniel also (confirmed by the Full Court in Dale ) reached the same conclusion in relation to Wong-Goo-TT-OO.
 Further, the Court said (at [34]) that: ...the rights and interests must have the characteristic that, by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples, those peoples have "a connection with" the land or waters.
 In Daniel , Nicholson J concluded, amongst other things, that Wong-Goo-TT-OO could not establish connection as a group nor that they held native title rights and interests as a group, even though those rights and interests 'appear in traditional form'. ( Dale at [19]; Daniel at [506]).
 Although a decision may be still be final notwithstanding that it can be subject to appeal, the Wong-Goo-TT-OO have already pursued and, indeed, exhausted all avenues of appeal in relation to Daniel and the Daniel Determination.
