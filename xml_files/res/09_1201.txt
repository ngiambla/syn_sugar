 Further, the Court said (at [34]) that: ...the rights and interests must have the characteristic that, by the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the relevant peoples, those peoples have "a connection with" the land or waters.
 In Daniel , Nicholson J concluded, amongst other things, that Wong-Goo-TT-OO could not establish connection as a group nor that they held native title rights and interests as a group, even though those rights and interests 'appear in traditional form'. ( Dale at [19]; Daniel at [506]).
