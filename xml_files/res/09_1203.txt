 THE DESCRIPTION OR IDENTIFICATION OF THE GROUP MEMBERS The subpoena in issue refers to " [e]ach litigation funding agreement entered into by IMF (Australia) Limited as at 23 December 2008 referred to in paragraph 2(c) of the application filed on 23 December 2008 ... ".
 A contention that the phrase " having a sufficient interest " qualifies both the reference to " any person " and " a party ", such that the Rule is read as referring to " a party ... having a sufficient interest ", is (with respect) unsustainable.
 The time at which a subpoena is sought or served may, however, be of relevance to an order setting it aside: cf Kennedy v Wallace [2004] FCA 636 at [26] , [2004] FCA 636 ; 136 FCR 114 at 121 per Gyles J.
 Such relevance as the subpoena was seen as potentially having at the time the order was made for its issue has been answered by: the identification or clarification of the forensic purpose being pursued by the Second to Sixth Respondents; and the submissions now advanced by Counsel on behalf of both Pharm-a-Care and IMF (Australia) Limited.
