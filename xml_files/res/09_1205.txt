 Circumstances where the Court may consider awarding costs on an indemnity basis include: While it was clear at the hearings of 11 June 2009 and 22 June 2009 that there was substantial identity of interest between the respondents, nonetheless I accept the submission of the respondents that Mr Troy Thomas incurred costs separately from Mr Rhys Thomas.
 Indeed, the applicant conceded in its submissions that, given the state of the evidence, there was no sufficient basis for an order against Mr Troy Thomas in relation to this aspect of the application.
 I consider that the claims against Mr Troy Thomas in terms of Pt A para 7 were of the nature described in Colgate-Palmolive (1993) 46 FCR and InterTAN [2005] FCAFC 54 , namely allegations which ought never to have been made, and which had no chance of success.
