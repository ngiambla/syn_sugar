 On 18 August 2009 the ACCC lodged an application and statement of claim seeking declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and injunctions and other orders under ss 80 and 86C of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the Act).
 The majority, Carr J at [36]-[55] and Branson J at [171]-[193], held that it was sufficient that there was a prima facie case for the relief sought on the basis of any of the causes of action relied upon.
 In construing O 8 r 3(2)(c), I am, bound to follow the view of the majority in Bray. " And at [25] His Honour said: "To determine whether there is a prima facie case for the relief sought, it is necessary to examine separately each claim for relief by reference to the relevant paragraph or paragraphs of the amended statement of claim, and by reference to the affidavit evidence filed in support of the application.
 Although technically the proceeding as a whole might fall within O 8 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules , because of the presence of the small number of claims, this is not enough to persuade me to exercise the discretion to permit service out of the jurisdiction in respect of the whole of the proceeding.
