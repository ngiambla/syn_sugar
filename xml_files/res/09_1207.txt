 Dr Woods explained that M G U S, myeloma (which clinicians and researchers test for by means of a bone marrow analysis) and AL amyloidosis are different manifestations of the same process .
 Dr Woods gave evidence that researchers think that M G U S, amyloidosis and multiple myeloma are all characterised by "an exposure" (ie. to benzene) of a B lymphocyte plasma cell which causes the plasma cells to become abnormal or cancerous.
 When the Tribunal was confronting the evidence given by the medical experts on the question of fact as to the characterisation of M G U S, AL amyloidosis and myeloma, the Tribunal had before it the evidence of Dr Davison, Dr Woods, Dr Catalano, Dr Grant and Dr Choo.
