 It noted that, prior to the hearing, ASIC had advised Mr Culley and the Tribunal that, at the hearing, it proposed also to rely on Mr Culley's involvement as sole director of Austbloom which had been subject to a report under s 533 of the Act on 20 November 2006.
 The questions read: (5) Whether the statutory power of disqualification contained in s 206F of the Corporations Act is subject to an implied requirement that it be exercised within a reasonable time; and (6) Whether the respondent failed to exercise its statutory power of disqualification contained in s 206F of the Corporations Act within a reasonable time.
 There is no evidence that ASIC took any steps between October 2002 and April 2005 to ascertain why Associates' liquidator had not provided a report under s 533 of the Act.
 Once the liquidator's report eventually arrived, ASIC did nothing until July 2006 to pursue the issue of whether Mr Culley should be disqualified from being a company director.
