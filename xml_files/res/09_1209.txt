 In Victoria, the Department of Transport (Victoria) (the DOT ) (through the Victorian Taxi Directorate (the VTD )) administers taxi-cab licences: ss 140 , 143 , 143A and 2 (1) of the Transport Act .
 The relationship between the DOT and the taxi-cab operator is governed by the licence conditions imposed by the DOT in accordance with the powers provided to it by the Transport Act : see [6] and [10] above.
 In other words, the taxi-cab operator applies for a licence, pays a licence fee, is granted a licence and is required to operate in accordance with that licence (including the obligations in relation to the MPTP).
