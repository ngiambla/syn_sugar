 The claim that Mr Shingles was denied procedural fairness because he was not given the opportunity to be heard on the question whether he exaggerated his capacity to retain employment was rejected by the Federal Magistrate.
 I should note that the Tribunal was constituted by two members --- a Senior Member who had had service experience in Vietnam, and a Member who was a medical practitioner.
 I'm certainly very conscious of the laws of evidence and that Tribunals particularly should not place their own opinions or experience in the place of evidence and as you've pointed out there has been no challenge.
