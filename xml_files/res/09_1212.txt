 EBD is party to Federal Court proceedings WAD 73 of 2008, (the Distribution Proceedings) which is an application by Emu Brewery Mezzanine Ltd (EBM) for approval to make a distribution to its creditors.
 In these circumstances, unless a settlement were reached and approved prior to resolution of the application for a pre-emptive costs order, EBD may recover nothing if that application is unsuccessful as it is without the means to further pursue its claim against EBM.
 The Settlement Deed is of no effect until approval of EBD's liquidators entering into it is obtained from the Court pursuant to s 477(2A) and a direction is obtained under s 511 that they are justified in entering into the compromise.
