 EBD claims that EBM is not entitled to make a distribution to its creditors, as proposed, because EBD is entitled to the money which is to be distributed.
 The defendant earlier made an application for an order that its reasonable costs and expenses be paid from the fund from which the joint liquidators propose to make a distribution to creditors.
 If that application were to have proceeded and an order was made in those terms, the legal costs incurred by both parties would, it seems, be significant and possibly in the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
