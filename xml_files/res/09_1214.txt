 By interlocutory process filed on 17 February 2009 in the Winding Up Proceeding, RGH sought an order that the rejection of its proof of debt be reversed (Proof of Debt Interlocutory Proceeding).
 His Honour ordered that the Proof of Debt Interlocutory Proceeding be transferred to the Construction List and be heard with the Construction List Proceeding, the evidence in each proceeding being evidence in the other.
