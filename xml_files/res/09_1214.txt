 Mr Chamberlain now applies for: Further, and of a different order, Mr Chamberlain seeks an order under s 564 of the Act that the DCT be given an advantage over other unsecured creditors of the Company.
 By interlocutory process filed on 17 February 2009 in the Winding Up Proceeding, RGH sought an order that the rejection of its proof of debt be reversed (Proof of Debt Interlocutory Proceeding).
 His Honour ordered that the Proof of Debt Interlocutory Proceeding be transferred to the Construction List and be heard with the Construction List Proceeding, the evidence in each proceeding being evidence in the other.
 Mr Chamberlain did not pursue either (a) or (b) above because the DCT had agreed to provide the funding and an indemnity against any adverse costs order, without claiming any proportion of the net proceeds of the litigation.
