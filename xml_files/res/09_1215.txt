 The Registrar of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations (the Registrar) has, by a delegate, Mr Armstrong, sought the winding up of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation for Welfare Services (the Corporation).
 It seems that the imminence of the hearing has, in ways that have not, unfortunately, hitherto occurred, focussed the minds of those in control of the Corporation on the need to order the affairs of the Corporation in a way that meets with compliance with the governing legislation: namely, the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (Cth) (Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act).
 Equally, and I think, on balance, more persuasively, there is also a public interest in this particular resource, if at all possible, remaining under local control of local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.
