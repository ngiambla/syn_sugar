 The Registrar of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations (the Registrar) has, by a delegate, Mr Armstrong, sought the winding up of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation for Welfare Services (the Corporation).
 There is an interrogative note in respect of whether the Mt Isa Town Council will or will not waive or grant exemption to the Corporation in respect of general rates.
 That particular application was not opposed by the Registrar, although it must be said that the Registrar is guarded and watchful in respect of the continued viability of the Corporation.
 I envisage that in the event that there is a basis for apprehension concerning the solvency of the Corporation, such as would ordinarily give rise to a basis for the appointment of a provisional liquidator, that the liberty to apply will be utilised for that purpose.
