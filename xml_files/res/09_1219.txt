 Attached to this affidavit is a letter from Mr Kerr to Deputy District Registrar Baldwin dated 16 October 2009 in which Mr Kerr sets out recent developments which he states have caused "major issues with the current timetable".
 These developments, which appear to be the grounds upon which Ms Kerr seeks an adjournment can be summarised as follows: Ms Kerr has a counterclaim for $900,000 in the District Court of Queensland against a plaintiff who was recently successful in obtaining an order for payment of $50,000 by Ms Kerr in that Court.
 Ms Kerr is appealing the decision of the District Court to the Court of Appeal of Queensland, although in his affidavit Mr Kerr deposed that the other party had applied for Ms Kerr's appeal to be summarily dismissed.
 Ms Kerr is dissatisfied with decisions taken by ITSA in the course of her bankruptcy, but understands that she would need to file an application in the Federal Magistrates Court to contest any decision of ITSA.
