 By that time s 62A had been enacted and was a ground able to be raised in the Federal Court proceeding: see s 197 of the Act. 14 On 13 March 2007 the following orders were made by Bennett J and undertakings noted: BY CONSENT, THE COURT ORDERS THAT: The appeal be dismissed.
 However lack of demonstrated standing is not my principal reason for taking that course. (b) Section 88 not enlivened 38 I earlier indicated that Mr Wilkshire's application does not on its face invoke a ground upon which the Court could order rectification by cancellation of the registration of the Council's trade mark.
 In that I agree with the Council's submission. 39 I have on a number of occasions indicated that at the time both of Mr Wilkshire's opposition to the Council's application to register and of the appeal which was dismissed by consent, the now s 62A ground of opposition was not then available.
