 With all deference we can only ask that in relation to costs, Your Honour is mindful of the sentencing remarks and since then, further diminished circumstances in the Federal Magistrates Court (Fazio v Centrelink (No 2) [2008] FMCA 1389. ' In the Federal Magistrates' decision referred to by Mr Fazio, the following comments were made by his Honour, Lucev FM: Sad circumstances surround these proceedings.
 Nevertheless, as his Honour concluded, especially in circumstances where Centrelink had given Mr Fazio notice of an intention to claim costs in respect of the proceedings if they were lost by Mr Fazio, he was put on notice as to that outcome and it was appropriate, on his Honour's view, notwithstanding the impecuniosity of Mr Fazio that costs should follow the event.
 The discretion to award costs has been described as being unfettered and absolute except that it must be exercised judicially, not arbitrarily or capriciously and cannot be exercised on grounds unconnected with the litigation --- Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (No 3) (1979) 42 FLR 213.
 There is no evidence before the Court as to the financial circumstances of Mr Fazio but even assuming they are precarious, that is an issue which can be dealt with by making provision for time to meet a costs order by way of instalments.
