 The discretion to award costs has been described as being unfettered and absolute except that it must be exercised judicially, not arbitrarily or capriciously and cannot be exercised on grounds unconnected with the litigation --- Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (No 3) (1979) 42 FLR 213.
