 That practice was not formally documented, but its existence and adaptation to the Tradecorp Agreement is evidenced by invoice 39 and its schedule if, as I do, one accepts Mr Russell's evidence in this regard.
 Insofar as Mr Russell sought to prove otherwise I have either not accepted that evidence (the stock checks) or my acceptance of it (the percentage of container lease commissions) does not affect that consequence.
 It follows from this that the amounts paid by Tradecorp to Ancath (which are Ancath's "ordinary income") constitute Mr Russell's "personal services income" as that term is defined in s 84 - 5 (1) of the ITAA 1997.
