 The corporate Respondents, Mobilegate and Winning Bid, and those of the individual Respondents with which I am concerned today, Messrs Owen, Salcedo and Maughan, might aptly be described as predators on the emotionally vulnerable for reward.
 In all, were one to assess a theoretical maximum in respect of Mobilegate, one would derive a maximum penalty under the Spam Act of something in excess of $72 million.
 The contraventions occurred in circumstances where, by virtue of Winning Bid and Mobilegate's contracts with aggregators for the providing of premium short codes, the corporate respondents had expressly agreed to comply with the Spam Act .
 Mr Maughan's subordination is recognised by the penalty range submitted for him being in the order of 40 % to 50 % of that submitted as apt in respect of Messrs Owen and Salcedo.
