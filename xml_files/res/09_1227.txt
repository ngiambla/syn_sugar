 Section 209(2) of the Supreme Court Act 1995 (Qld), provided: A person who is not a barrister or solicitor of the Supreme Court shall not be entitled to claim or recover or receive directly or indirectly a sum of money or other remuneration for appearing or acting on behalf of another person in the Supreme Court.
 Only certificated practitioners may so act --- see s 76 of the Legal Practitioners Act --- unless, of course, the court is, in the particular matter, exercising federal jurisdiction, in which event any person entitled to practise as a barrister or solicitor in any federal court has a right of audience --- s 55B(4) of the Judiciary Act ...
 However, the expression "legal practitioner" used in r 8(1) is not at large and is defined by O 1, r 4 FCR to mean a person: (a) who is: (i) a barrister; or (ii) a solicitor; or (iii) a barrister and solicitor; and (b) who is lawfully entitled to practise as such in a federal court.
