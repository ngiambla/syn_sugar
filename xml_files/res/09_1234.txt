 In the Motion in which these orders are sought, the applicants seek an additional order that, in the event that the orders which they seek in respect of the Notices to Admit are not complied with, the respondent's defence be struck out.
 In order to respond to these matters, the respondent would be required to interpret the particular terms in those Rules and then come to a conclusion as to whether the functions and duties of that particular individual were within that interpretation.
 But, subject to the two exceptions to which I have referred at [21] and [22] above, it seems to me that the Notice on its face is otherwise entirely regular and canvasses material which the respondent ought to be able to address, either by way of admission or by way of explanation as to the basis upon which the admissions sought cannot or should not be made.
