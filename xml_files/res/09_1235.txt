 This is an application by notice of motion filed on 12 October 2009 by which the applicants seek the following orders, namely: Pursuant to section 33V(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 ("Federal Court Act") the Court approves the settlement of this proceeding in accordance with the Terms of Settlement and Further Terms of Settlement, copies of which are attached as Annexures 1 and 2 .
 In the principal proceeding, the application is brought by the applicants as a representative party on behalf of 102 group members although some of those group members represent more than one individual or corporation.
 The Court takes the advice into account in determining whether the settlement is fair and reasonable, that is to say, whether the agreed settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable likely outcomes, taking everything into account.
 Having regard to the material read in support of the application and the joint advice which, by reason of its confidentiality, has remained sealed, I am satisfied that the settlement is a fair and reasonable settlement of the claims made by the group members who will be bound by the settlement.
