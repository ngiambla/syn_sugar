 In addition, at all material times Chalice has complied with the provisions of Ch 2M (financial reporting requirements) and s 674 of the Act (continuous disclosure requirements) as they applied to Chalice; there was and is no excluded information as defined in s 708A(7) of the Act which would have been required to be disclosed or now requires disclosure and, accordingly, no injustice will have been caused to any person by reason of the Notice not having been lodged within five business days of the shares being issued.
 Chalice was then and has at all material times been able to issue a Notice under that paragraph as: (a) the shares concerned are in a class of securities that were quoted securities at all times in the three months before the day on which the shares were issued; and (b) trading in that class of securities on a prescribed financial market on which they were quoted was not suspended for more than a total of five days during the shorter of the period during which the class of securities were quoted and the period of 12 months before the day on which the shares were issued; and (c) no exemption under s 111AS or s 111AT of the Act related to Chalice or any person as director or the auditor of Chalice at any time during the relevant period referred to in (b) above; and (d) no order under s 340 or s 341 of the Act related to Chalice or any person as director or auditor of Chalice at any time during the relevant period referred to in (b) above.
 The declaratory relief sought by Chalice under s 1322(4)(a) of the Act to the effect that a Notice given under s 708A(5)(e) of the Act within the extended period be deemed to take effect as if it had been given within the period of five business days from 10 September 2009, that is, within the required five business day period, is consistent with relief granted in the matters of Charter Hall Limited, in the matter of Charter Hall Limited [2007] FCA 1316 , Diversified, in the matter of Diversified United Investment Limited ACN 006 713 177 [2008] FCA 720 and In the Matter of Chameleon Mining NL [2009] NSWSC 660.
