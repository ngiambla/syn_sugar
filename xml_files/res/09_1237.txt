 APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL By way of an application filed 11 August 2009, the applicant seeks leave to file and serve a Notice of Appeal outside the time limits prescribed by Order 52 Rule 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules 1979.
 It was not satisfied that he was assaulted or treated for an assault as claimed. [8] The Tribunal also had regard to inconsistencies between the applicant's description of the caste wall and the independent country information in relation to when the wall was erected and its dimensions.
 It was of the view that his lack of knowledge in relation to the wall was not because he was traumatised or had difficulty recalling, but because he had not seen it and had not been involved in activities in relation to the wall or its destruction.
