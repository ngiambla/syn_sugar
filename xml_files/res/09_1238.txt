 I note that there seems to me to be an inconsistency between the claim that the product is not suitable for use as a screen-printing medium and the claim by Mr Wang that it is the company policy not to supply the product to customers who propose to screen-print with it.
 The submission from the applicants is that the documents discovered by the respondent are an incomplete collection, and further relevant documents are likely to be in the possession of the screen-printing customers.
 The applicants can point to the fact that the parties against whom third-party discovery is pressed are purchasers of the product the subject of these proceedings, and also can point to the fact that those persons engage in screen printing.
