 The applicant, Mr Pascoe, who is the trustee of the bankrupt estate of Mr Boensch, contended that Raphael FM failed to address what was necessary for him to be able to reach a conclusion that the applicant had no reasonable prospects of successfully prosecuting the remainder of his case.
 The first respondent submitted that there were extensive delays and it had been open to the applicant to amend the remainder of his Points of Claim whilst the separate question remained unresolved, especially whilst awaiting the outcome of the application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.
 Where a party has had a sufficient opportunity to plead his case, it may be necessary for the Court to make a decision which may produce a sense of injustice in that party, for the sake of doing justice to, in this case, Mr Boensch, and also to other litigants.
 More importantly, for the purposes of the present case, it also provided for a judgment in the nature of summary dismissal of the whole or any part of a proceeding on the application of a respondent, in the event that it was satisfied that the applicant had no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding.
