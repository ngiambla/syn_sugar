 On 14 November 2008, Webcot's solicitors wrote again to Mr Jephcott's solicitors asking for further information in relation to Agserv Pty Limited and Agnova Technologies Pty Limited, Univar Pty Limited and Xenex Associates Limited.
 The letter said that Mr Jephcott does not presently propose to enter into any type of relationship inconsistent with his duties to Webcot or engage in a business that is in competition with Webcot.
 It is asserted that those " strategies " constitute confidential information of Webcot and that, in his capacity as an employee and director of Webcot, Mr Jephcott obtained that confidential information.
 There is no material presently before the Court as to what the so-called pricing strategies and sales and marketing strategies for the sale of Protector or the customer base for Protector that may have been developed by Webcot consist of.
