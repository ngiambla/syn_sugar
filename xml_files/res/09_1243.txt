 This is an appeal against orders of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( the Tribunal ) ( SZNHU v Minister for Immigration Anor No 3 [2009] FMCA 777).
 As to the four grounds which were put to the Federal Magistrates Court (grounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the notice of appeal) I can see no error in the Federal Magistrate's reasoning.
 As to ground 3 (unfairness in that the Tribunal did not use independent country information to evaluate the appellant's claims), the Federal Magistrate (at [24]) found that the Tribunal had no obligation to use independent country information or to conduct any independent inquiry.
