 The applicant went on to contend that without further information the case was not clear and that the applicant could not make an informed decision as to whether to commence a proceeding for the relief which it was contemplating bringing against OMH.
 At the centre of the applicant's case is the contention that there may have been a mutual voting agreement or understanding between the directors and executives who were to benefit from the passing of the resolutions in the terms postulated by the applicant.
 Those two persons, therefore, lacked capacity to vote at a general meeting and were, therefore, not in a position to confer the reciprocal benefit essential to the postulated pact, on the other beneficiary directors and executives.
