 THE HEARING At the hearing, counsel said that the applicant was no longer contemplating bringing a proceeding based on the allegation that in agreeing to issue the options the directors acted for the improper purpose of diluting the applicant's interest in OMH.
 The applicant went on to contend that without further information the case was not clear and that the applicant could not make an informed decision as to whether to commence a proceeding for the relief which it was contemplating bringing against OMH.
 Mr Kuzmenkov deposed that the applicant was contemplating bringing a claim on the basis that one of the directors' purposes in approving the issue of the options to the recipients may have been to dilute the shareholding of the applicant in OMH.
