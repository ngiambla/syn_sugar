 However, there is a Decision ('the primary decision') signed on 1 April 2008 at 10.15 am and also a Notification of decision signed 1 April 2008 at 10.20 am and verified by the appellant's signature on the same day at 10.40 am.
 The Tribunal then referred to the primary decision under review as follows (at [22]): On 1 April 2008 the delegate proceeded to cancel the review applicant's student visa pursuant to subsections 116(1)(b), 116(3) and subregulation 2.43(2)(b) for non-compliance with condition 8202 (D1, f.71-76).
 In addition, the Tribunal notes that, in its section 359A letter dated 1 August 2008, the review applicant was invited to provide comment and further information relating to the issues arising in relation to his application for review.
 The Tribunal concluded by stating that it was satisfied that the relevant conditions existed for a cancellation of the visa under s 116(3) of the Act and reg 2.43(b) of the Regulations and upheld the primary decision.
 The appellant submits that the Tribunal retains a discretion to gain more information in such situation, and pursuant to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI and Another [2009] HCA 30 ; (2009) 258 ALR 434 , it may do that by telephone or other means.
 The Court granted leave to the appellant and Minister to make further submissions in reliance upon this decision and for both the appellant and Minister to make further submissions in reply to each other's further submissions.
 Both the appellant and Minister took advantage of the leave to make submissions on the effect of SZIAI , and the Minister has also made submissions in reply to the appellant's submissions on the effect of SZIAI .
 The Court does not need to, and therefore declines to, make any findings in relation to the other grounds of appeal, though it should be noted that submissions in relation to the other grounds of appeal are partially relevant for the consideration of ground one.
 The Tribunal recognised that this was a problem, as it wrote to the appellant on 1 August 2008 in the invitation seeking information under s 359A and s 359(2) of the Act and specifically sought information concerning 10 March 2008 and 1 April 2008.
 Both SZIAI and Le formulate the type of information similarly: ' an obvious inquiry about a critical fact ' (in SZIAI at [25]) or ' obtain important information on a critical issue ' (in Le at [63]).
 Both SZIAI and Le make it plain that the inquiry must be directed towards information, ' the existence of which is easily ascertained ' (in SZIAI at [25]) or ' which the decision-maker knows, or ought reasonably to know is readily available ' (in Le at [63]).
