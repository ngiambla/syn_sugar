 The Invitation was not given in accordance with ss 424(3)(a) and 424B of the Migration Act : The invitation did not specify the way in which the additional information may be given.
 As to s 424 , the Court, at [46] held that the general power to "get" information and the specific power to "invite" in writing the giving of additional information are capable of co-existing without the latter being repugnant to the former.
 The Full Federal Court, however, referred to SZKTI in the High Court and, at [21], held that it cannot be said that s 424(2) is the only source of the Tribunal's power to obtain information.
 The Full Court at [23] further stated, although as an unnecessary additional, therefore obiter comment, that it did not accept that the acknowledgement letter was, in the words of s 424(2) at the relevant time, an invitation to a person to give additional information.
