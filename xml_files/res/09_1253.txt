 On 19 September 2007 the applicant filed a notice of motion seeking an adjournment of the hearing of the notice of motion filed on 12 June 2007 to amend the applicant's third further amended statement of claim.
 On 7 November 2007 I noted the parties' agreement: The parties are to confer in relation to the respondents' objections to the proposed fourth further amended statement of claim dated 24 October 2007.
 On 23 November 2007 the respondents wrote to my chambers advising that the proposed further fourth amended statement of claim which had been lodged on 22 November 2007 was substantially different to that which had been lodged on 13 November 2007.
