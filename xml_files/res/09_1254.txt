 Particulars: The Tribunal failed to provide me notice under section 424A of the Migration Act that: (i) I have considered the independent information which indicated that it is relatively easy to obtain false documents in India.
 On this basis, the Tribunal made findings regarding his membership in the HIA and PMK and had regard to independent country information about the ease with which false documents can be obtained in India ([78]).
 The Tribunal's finding that the appellant's claims were unrelated to the Refugees Convention was a finding of fact that correctly emphasises that the reason for feared harm must be found in the 'singling out' of one or more of the five attributes expressed in the Convention definition.
 See Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 , McHugh and Gummow J at 28; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VFAY [2003] FCAFC 191 at [49] --- [56].
