 I haven't been provided audio recording of the interview with the department, so how can I provide that audio recording to the Federal Magistrates Court. ... the tape recording that I attended the interview with delegate ... was not available to me.
 I said, after hearing from both the appellant and Mr Johnson of counsel for the Minister: It seems to me that, truly, if in fact the tape shows that there was a request made during, or at the end of the interview, then I may have to hear some further evidence.
 It was submitted by counsel for the Minister that the tape does not contain any evidence supporting the appellant's statement to the Court that he requested a copy of the tape at the interview.
 Smith FM concluded that there was no jurisdictional error revealed by the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court, and that he had not been able to identify any error in the way the Tribunal dealt with the review before it.
