 It is, in substance, that upon Castleworld becoming a registered proprietor of the land in question (the Dongara Land), the interest which was held by Castleworld became and continues to be indefeasible within the meaning of the Transfer of Land Act 1893 (WA) (TLA).
 They plead (at para 9(c)), amongst other things, that it is to be inferred from the particularised matters that Castleworld acted fraudulently to procure its registration as the registered proprietor of the Dongara Land, for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the land.
 The third element is that Castleworld did not at any time, prior to its registration as proprietor of the Dongara Land, notify the applicants of the fact that it intended to purchase or had purchased the Dongara Land.
 The first is that none of the matters pleaded in the 21 particulars demonstrate that the actions taken by Castleworld were taken for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the Dongara Land.
 It is an allegation, in substance, that Castleworld intentionally or recklessly misled its financier, in order to obtain the necessary funds for the acquisition of the Dongara Land, for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the land.
 The question which really falls for consideration at present is whether, as a matter of principle, the pleaded fraud against the financier, if established, is a fraud for the purpose of the indefeasibility provisions of the TLA.
 The causal link here is pleaded, that is to say para 9(c) pleads that the fraud which was conducted was conducted for the purpose of defeating the applicant's claimed interest in the land.
