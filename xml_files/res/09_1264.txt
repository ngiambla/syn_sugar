 The submissions on behalf of the appellants acknowledge that under ss 276 , 277 and 281 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) only a migration agent can charge for advising on, preparing for, or representing a person before a hearing of the Tribunal.
 As the appellants' submissions demonstrate, their claim for a costs order in relation to the proceedings before the third Tribunal is founded entirely on considerations of what is said to be "fair" and "right", considerations redolent of what can be characterised as "palm tree" justice.
 The power in the Federal Court to award costs is contained in s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and O 62 rr 3 and 5 of the Federal Court Rules .
