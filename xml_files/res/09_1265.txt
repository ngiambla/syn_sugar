 The Tribunal considered it was reasonable for the appellant to relocate because: The Tribunal was also satisfied that reasonable state protection was available to the appellant ([34]).
 The singular ground alleged in the appellant's notice of appeal replicates a ground that was argued, initially successfully, in SZNAV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 693 ; (2009) 229 FLR 461 before a Federal Magistrate.
 However, on appeal before a specially convened bench of three justices of the Full Federal Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZNAV [2009] FCAFC 109 , the decision of the Federal Magistrate was reversed.
