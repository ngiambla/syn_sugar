 A question then is: am I satisfied that it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up?
 In WPS Motorsport I was faced with a question as to whether, on the evidence to hand, I was satisfied that it was in the interests of the creditors to the company for the winding up application to be adjourned.
 Nonetheless, there is a basis upon which, in my opinion, it is in the interests of creditors for there at least to be a short adjournment so that the position can be further investigated and detailed.
