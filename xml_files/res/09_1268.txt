 It affirmed the decision of an ARO made on 21 July 2008 that Mr Kronen had committed another NSA participation failure without reasonable excuse on 6 June 2008 and as a result, an eight week non-payment period was applied.
 In respect of both periods, because of the terms of the notices sent him requiring him to enter into an agreement, he was also required to satisfy s 593(1)(e) which obliged him to enter into the agreement required by the Secretary.
 It is clear from the terms of the notices sent to Mr Kronen by Maxima (as the delegate of the Secretary), that he was being required first to enter into an activity agreement and, later, a further agreement: s 605(1) and (2).
 The two general matters informing his "unreasonableness" contention were (a) the delegate's alleged refusal to negotiate with him notwithstanding he was prepared to negotiate "rationally and in good faith"; and (b) the requirement that he deal with the delegate given his complaints about its conduct.
