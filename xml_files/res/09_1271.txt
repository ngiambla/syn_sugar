 The first appellant alleged that, although the BJP was in power in the State of Gujarat where he lived, the local police were corrupt and connected to the Congress Party and could not protect him ([32]).
 The Full Federal Court held in the light of Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI [2009] HCA 30 ; (2009) 258 ALR 434 --- a recent decision of the High Court of Australia --- that an acknowledgement letter was not an invitation to provide the Tribunal with additional information made under s 424(2) of the Act.
 Consequently, any argument that procedural fairness requires that an applicant and the presiding Tribunal member must, for the duration of a Tribunal hearing, be physically in the same room founders on s.429A.
 This conclusion is supported by the reasons for judgment of Reeves J in SZJTK v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2008] FCA 1712 where his Honour considered an allegation relevantly identical to the one presenting for consideration in these proceedings.
