 Having first said that the hypothesis relied on by the appellant of depression arising from seasickness was reasonable, the Tribunal said that the next question was "whether the Tribunal can be satisfied that the seasickness was not attributable to operational service".
 I am not satisfied that the Tribunal's use of the expressions "not attributable to operational service" and "the cause of the seasickness" shows that it properly considered s 196B(14).
 I am unable to see why the pre-operational severe seasickness should foreclose the possibility that a later occurrence of seasickness on operational service would be a stressor that was related to service within s 196B.
