 Thirdly, whether there is evidence that by examination of the person (which may be thwarted if the person flees Australia) ASIC is likely to improve the chances of the aggrieved persons retrieving their moneys.
 Mr Bertram has also set out in his affidavit, an indicative timetable which discloses an intention by ASIC to conduct examinations of Mr Johnston under the coercive powers in the ASIC Act, both in relation to the Firepower BVI investigation and also in relation to the affairs of Firepower Operations.
 Weighing the strength of the evidence against the inconvenience to Mr Johnston and the risk to the public interest if the orders were not made, I am satisfied that the interim orders should be made.
