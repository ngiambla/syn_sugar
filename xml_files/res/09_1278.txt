 On 8 September 2009 the Registry of this Court wrote to the appellant and the Minister's legal representative notifying them that the appeal would be heard at 9.30 am on 5 November 2009.
 On 2 November 2009 the solicitors for the Minister forwarded a letter by Express Post to the appellant noting that the matter was listed for hearing on 5 November 2009 at 9.30 am and stating that if the appellant did not attend the hearing, either in person or by a legal representative, the solicitors for the Minister were instructed to have the matter dismissed with costs.
 In these circumstances, Ms Dinihan seeks an order that the appeal be dismissed for the failure of the appellant to attend the hearing relating to the appeal, relying on s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
