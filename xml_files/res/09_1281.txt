 Mr Spencer says that that statement was only directed to Greenwood J determining his application for leave to act as a director under s 471A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act") and not to his application for leave to appeal the decision of Logan J.
 This is so because Greenwood J recorded (at [6] of his decision) he had before him written submissions by Mr Spencer directed to the issues involved in both his applications for leave under s 471A of the Act and for leave to appeal.
 He, therefore, refused both the application for leave to appeal the decision of Logan J and, as a necessary consequence, the application for Mr Spencer to have leave to act as a director under s 471A of the Act: at [19].
