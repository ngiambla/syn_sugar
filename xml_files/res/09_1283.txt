 In Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 7) [2009] FCA 1140 ( Betfair (No 7) ) I determined questions of privilege on the same grounds (but for parliamentary privilege) in respect of some of the same documents.
 The State appealed against the part of my orders rejecting its claim for legal professional privilege over communications with Parliamentary Counsel involving instructions to and the provision of draft legislation and related communications.
 I do not accept the State's proposition that every document concerning the preparation of draft legislation is protected by parliamentary privilege because of the fact that, ultimately, Parliament makes legislation.
