 Alternatively, no inference can be drawn that any Tribunal leaflet that was enclosed notified the appellant of all places "where the application for review can be made" as required by s 66(2)(d)(iv) of the Migration Act .
 By analogy to Uddin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 841 a notice has to identify all places where an application for review can be made.
 The appellant submitted that s 494B(4) did not apply as the appellant did not provide his residential address in Australia for the purposes of receiving documents as required by s 494B(c)(ii) of the Migration Act .
 By analogy to Chand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 106 FCR 140 ; [2000] FCA 1743 at [14] - [17] , the appellant elected to receive correspondence at his email address.
