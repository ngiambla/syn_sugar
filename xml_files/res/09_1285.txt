 In dealing with the second response from DFAT in answer to its further request for information, the Tribunal said that no information to support the appellant's claims was found.
 DFAT provided Mr Sharma's information in that part of its response dealing with the first question of publication of the article and not in the part dealing with the second question whether the incident occurred.
 The Tribunal mentioned that the editor of the newspaper (Mr Sharma) had confirmed the fact of publication (the first question) but did not refer to any of the other things he said relevant to the occurrence of the incident (the second question).
