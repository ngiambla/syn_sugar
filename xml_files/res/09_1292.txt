 The Court on that occasion emphasised that it was appropriate to set the trial date and proceed on the basis that the proceeding would go to a hearing before the end of 2009.
 On 4 November 2009, the matter again came on for directions before me and the question of consolidation or alternative orders, which were then the subject of the recently filed notice of motion, was listed by me for hearing on 10 November 2009.
