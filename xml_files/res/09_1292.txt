 The Court on that occasion emphasised that it was appropriate to set the trial date and proceed on the basis that the proceeding would go to a hearing before the end of 2009.
 On 4 November 2009, the matter again came on for directions before me and the question of consolidation or alternative orders, which were then the subject of the recently filed notice of motion, was listed by me for hearing on 10 November 2009.
 Allphones contends that to the extent that the current proceedings before me allege breaches of statutory obligations, those matters are wholly directed towards supporting the applicant's case in contract or unconscionability and are all directed towards the question of renewal of the Old Agreement.
