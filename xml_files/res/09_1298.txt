 It remains to consider what, if any, damages Mr Mykhalovskyi should be ordered to pay Deckers in respect of the infringing and tortious conduct for which he has been found to be liable to Deckers.
 This evidence satisfies me that Mr Mykhalovskyi was engaged, on a regular basis, in the manufacture of counterfeit footwear at the Moorabbin factory in 2005, 2006 and 2007.
