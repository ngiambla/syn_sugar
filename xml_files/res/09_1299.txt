 The respondent went on to contend that, were those submissions to be accepted, the applicant's BSS trade mark should be cancelled pursuant to the provisions of s 88(1)(a) and s 88(2)(a) of the Act.
 This question, so it was submitted, is to be considered absent the registration of the applicant's BSS trade mark and is a largely hypothetical inquiry, although it may be informed by what traders have, in fact, done.
