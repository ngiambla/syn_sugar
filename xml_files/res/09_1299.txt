 Distinctiveness in fact as at 22 March 1988 may be relevant to the respondent's case for cancellation of the applicant's BSS trade mark pursuant to ss 88(1)(a), 88(2)(a), 57 and 41 of the Act.
 The respondent went on to contend that, were those submissions to be accepted, the applicant's BSS trade mark should be cancelled pursuant to the provisions of s 88(1)(a) and s 88(2)(a) of the Act.
 In the present case, the respondent bears the onus of proving that, as at 6 December 2006, the applicant's BSS trade mark did not distinguish the applicant's BSS balanced salt solution from sterile ophthalmic irrigating solutions supplied by others in Australia.
 This question, so it was submitted, is to be considered absent the registration of the applicant's BSS trade mark and is a largely hypothetical inquiry, although it may be informed by what traders have, in fact, done.
