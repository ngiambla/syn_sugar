 It can be seen that the Full Court's finding that lot 46 comprised "new residential premises" was based on its view that use of room 202 as a motel room, was not use for "residential accommodation" and that the sale by Hajuku to Tarfex was not a sale of residential premises.
 Pursuant to s 40-65 a sale of real property is input taxed to the extent that the property is "residential premises to be used predominantly for residential accommodation (regardless of the term of occupation)".
 Although the applicants' primary position is that the supply is not input taxed, they sought, in the alternative, a declaration that the fourth supply is input taxed, if I should determine that the first and third supplies are input taxed.
