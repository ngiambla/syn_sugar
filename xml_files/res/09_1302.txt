 The Tribunal noted that without further details and corroborative evidence or the opportunity to test the appellant's evidence the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner or had ever been involved in Falun Gong activities.
 However the appellant contended that the Tribunal's letter of 20 December 2007 did not provide sufficient particulars of the adverse information which the Tribunal would rely upon without further evidence to reach its conclusion he was not a Falun Gong practitioner.
 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal gave the appellant a proper invitation to the oral hearing and that it was the responsibility of the appellant to ensure he understood the contents of the Tribunal's letter.
