 The appellant appeals against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate on 26 September 2008: MZYAA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 1304 , dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") on 22 February 2008.
 The Federal Magistrate said that the transcript did not show on its face either unfairness to the appellant or a predisposition amounting to a mind not open to argument and that the audio recording did not show any overt hostility on the part of the Tribunal.
 The Federal Magistrate was given the opportunity by the appellant and his representative to listen to the audio recording of the hearing before the Tribunal and to read a written transcript of that hearing in addition to their affidavit evidence as to the conduct of the hearing.
