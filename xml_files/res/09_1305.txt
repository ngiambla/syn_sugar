 Taken at the highest for Goodman Fielder, and assuming I accepted that the new logo made the representation Goodman Fielder suggested, it would at least be necessary that it faithfully reflect the actual result of the surveys.
 Even if other possibilities are open that does not exclude the irresistible conclusion that the logo, in its context and setting, had a real, or not remote, chance or possibility of being understood by a representative member of the relevant class in that way.
 I accept, as submitted by counsel for Goodman Fielder, that the purpose of the Goodman Fielder officers is not decisive of whether the conduct of Goodman Fielder was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive or whether any representation made by the logo was false within the meaning of s 53 of the Act.
