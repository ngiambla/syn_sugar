 Mr Dhillon's proposed evidence The evidence to be adduced from Mr Dhillon was contained in identified paragraphs of two affidavits affirmed on 9 March 2009 and 30 July 2009 respectively.
 Accordingly, I will not, on the present state of the evidence, allow the applicant to adduce evidence of the contents of Mr Salcedo's email relying on s 64(2) of the Evidence Act .
 That is particularly so when cross-examination is required on matters where it may be important to form a view about the reliability of evidence and, perhaps, the credit or overall credibility of a witness.
 In the present case the claimed inconvenience of requiring Mr McDermott and the other witness to attend for cross-examination in person fell into two broad categories --- cost (and commercial inconvenience) to the applicant and inconvenience to the witnesses.
