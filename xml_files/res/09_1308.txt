 THE ISSUES The publishers have filed a motion seeking an order under s 40 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the issues in the proceedings, other than damages, be tried by a jury.
 Thus, the question of the capacity of the matters complained of to convey any of the defamatory meanings alleged (as opposed to whether they in fact were conveyed) would remain a question of law to be decided by a judge.
 CONCLUSION An order should be made under s 40 providing for a trial by a jury of 12 of all issues in the proceedings other than damages at common law or under any Act and any questions of law or questions that by an Act must not be decided by a jury.
 Thus, the jury will decide whether the publishers published each of the five alleged defamatory matters and made the representations alleged to contravene s 53B of the Trade Practices Act pleaded in the amended statement of claim about Ms Ra.
