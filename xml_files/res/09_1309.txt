 LeasePlan contends that the GST assessment is excessive because it was entitled to input tax credits under Div 11 of the GST Act, and more particularly because it acquired second-hand goods for a purpose of sale in the ordinary course of business.
 Section 11-5 defines a 'creditable acquisition' as follows: You make a creditable acquisition if: (a) you acquire anything solely or partly for a creditable purpose; and (b) the supply of the thing to you is a taxable supply; and (c) you provide, or are liable to provide, consideration for the supply; and (d) you are registered, or are required to be registered.
 LeasePlan relied on the documentary evidence to demonstrate that the leases specifically contemplated the disposal of the vehicles by sale and further that the contemplation of net proceeds of sale and residual value of the vehicles, at the time of acquisition, substantiated the claim that sale was a purpose for which the vehicles were acquired.
