 Beconwood contends that Opes is estopped from contending that Beconwood does not have an equitable interest in the shares as a result of representations made by Opes, the representations being: (a) Beconwood would retain beneficial ownership of all shares lodged under the margin lending facility; (b) all shares lodged would be held by Opes' custodian (ANZ Nominees); (c) the transaction could be reversed at any time; and (d) any clauses in the margin lending facility agreement inconsistent with Beconwood's beneficial ownership in the shares were not terms of the margin lending facility agreement.
 Beconwood also claims that Opes contravened ss 942B and 953B of the Corporations Act on the basis that a document entitled Financial Services Guide provided to Beconwood was misleading and deceptive.
 The FSG stated that Beconwood would retain beneficial and economic ownership of the stock, the transaction could be reversed at any time and all securities and cash lodged as collateral would be held and settled with the custodian.
 Once it is accepted that Beconwood should be given leave to proceed with its rectification claims, there is no reason to limit the grant of leave to those claims.
