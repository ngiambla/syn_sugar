 When Electoral Commissioner must apply for an inquiry (2) If the Electoral Commissioner believes that the result of an election for an office has been affected by an irregularity in relation to the election, the Electoral Commissioner must make an application for an inquiry by the Federal Court into the matter.
 When Electoral Commissioner may apply for an inquiry (3) If the Electoral Commissioner believes that there has been an irregularity in relation to an election for an office, the Electoral Commissioner may make an application for an inquiry by the Federal Court into the matter.
 In contrast, s 200(2) is expressed in mandatory terms --- " [i]f the Electoral Commissioner believes that the result of an election ... has been affected by an irregularity ", the Commissioner " must make an application for an inquiry by the Federal Court ... ".
 But the absence of an express requirement that the belief be based " on reasonable grounds " in s 200(2) or (3) --- and the express inclusion of such a requirement as a prerequisite to the Court ordering an inquiry under s 201(b) --- was not explored.
