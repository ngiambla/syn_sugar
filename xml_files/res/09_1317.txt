 The new market definition is pleaded in paragraph 12 as "a national market [in Australia] for the supply of Rubber Chemicals to commercial manufacturers of Rubber Compounds and Rubber Products within the meaning of s 4E of the Act".
 The applicant submits that its definition of "the Australian market" is sufficient and not productive of confusion, notwithstanding the later references to a global market for the supply of the same rubber chemicals.
 Emirates and the other authorities to which I have referred make it clear that, simply because a market is global, this does not mean that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products.
 The respondents complain that these amendments have not overcome the difficulties identified in my earlier reasons apart from the failure to allege that the Australian respondents were aware of the provisions of the cartel agreements.
