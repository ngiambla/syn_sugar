 As Mr Powers' affidavit showed, there have been a series of amendments to the pleadings already, including an application to substitute applicants, at which time, according to Optus, the position of Sound Advertising ought to have been considered.
 Mr Powers' affidavit notes that there has been an order for security for costs in Optus' favour in the amount of $300,000 in circumstances where already the costs substantially exceed that amount, apparently being in the amount to date of approximately $580,000.
