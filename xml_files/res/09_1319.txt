 As Mr Powers' affidavit showed, there have been a series of amendments to the pleadings already, including an application to substitute applicants, at which time, according to Optus, the position of Sound Advertising ought to have been considered.
 Mr Powers described in his affidavit the further inquiries Optus will need to make and the further evidence that Optus will need to obtain in order to address the representations proposed to be pleaded by the applicants.
 Mr Powers' affidavit notes that there has been an order for security for costs in Optus' favour in the amount of $300,000 in circumstances where already the costs substantially exceed that amount, apparently being in the amount to date of approximately $580,000.
 I accept the distinction which Mr Kun has drawn between an explanation for why the litigation has been run as it has been and an explanation about Mr Charlesworth's changes in his evidentiary position.
