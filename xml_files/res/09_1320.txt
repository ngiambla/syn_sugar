 There is no allegation of any contravention by Burnett Water insofar as the qualities of the fish transfer device are concerned with respect to whether the device as designed and installed might occasion injury or death to lungfish attempting to move upstream and downstream.
 It is by no means impossible to see how, as a matter of discretion, evidence which might go to demonstrate that the contraventions as alleged are important because the lungfish have nowhere else to go, in terms of migration upstream or downstream is relevant.
 I think, however, any such difference is unlikely, in most cases, to be of significance in the light, in particular, of s 135 of the Evidence Act and its likely application to disembodied and unsubstantiated expressions of opinion, a matter to which reference was made in Quick v Stoland .
 I also regard the report as deficient in terms of technical compliance with the requirements of the exception to the opinion rule in s 79 , the latter largely for the reasons reflected and enlarged upon in the submissions, written and oral, made on behalf of Burnett Water.
