 Elecon Engineering continued to use the know-how and the technical information which had been provided to it by PIV Antrieb and to manufacture and sell gearboxes which bore the mark PIV.
 In May and July 2004 and February 2005 there were exchanges of correspondence between attorneys in India representing PIV Antrieb and Elecon Engineering respectively about the consequences of termination of the know-how contract.
 Shortly thereafter, on 23 December 2004, PIV Drives and Brevini Australia ("the Brevini interests") commenced the proceeding in NSD 1955 of 2004 against Elecon Australia, Elecon Engineering and Mr Patel ("the Elecon interests").
 The reason for the conclusion that the major default provision operated for the benefit of PIV Antrieb, but not for the benefit of Elecon Engineering, requires further elaboration.
