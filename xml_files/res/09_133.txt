 Payments made by the company comprising a total amount of $116,830.00 include payments made by the company to the Commissioner in respect of liabilities of the company arising under the relevant provisions of the legislation identified in s 588FGA(1).
 The second and third defendants, Mr Wayne Harris and Mr Thomas MacKellar, were directors of the company when each of the six payments described in para 6 of the affidavit of Mr Mark Anthony Conlan sworn 27 August 2008 (filed 2 September 2008) were made to the Commissioner.
 In an affidavit sworn by Mr Leon Filewood on 19 February 2009, Mr Filewood deposes to a conversation with Mr MacKellar and a conversation between Mr Harris, Mr Filewood and Mr Broderick of Gadens Lawyers, the solicitors for the Commissioner.
 Accordingly, for present purposes, the Court needs to be satisfied that the relevant transactions involve insolvent transactions of the Company entered into in the relevant period, in this case in the period between 8 March 2005 and 8 September 2005.
