 Payments made by the company comprising a total amount of $116,830.00 include payments made by the company to the Commissioner in respect of liabilities of the company arising under the relevant provisions of the legislation identified in s 588FGA(1).
 The second and third defendants, Mr Wayne Harris and Mr Thomas MacKellar, were directors of the company when each of the six payments described in para 6 of the affidavit of Mr Mark Anthony Conlan sworn 27 August 2008 (filed 2 September 2008) were made to the Commissioner.
 In an affidavit of Ruth Carter sworn 19 February 2009, Ms Carter deposes to having sent letters by express post to Mr Harris and Mr MacKellar at a residential address and care of a particular firm giving notice to each defendant that the applications would be finally determined on 19 February 2009.
 Mr Filewood deposes to discussions in which Mr MacKellar acknowledged receipt of correspondence notifying him of the hearing of the matter on 19 February 2009 and a discussion with Mr Harris in which Mr Harris was advised that the Commissioner would seek final orders in support of the Commissioner's claim for an indemnity, on 19 February 2009.
 The essence of those matters are first, a contention that the Company was not insolvent at the relevant time and secondly, a contention that the Commissioner's claim for indemnity overlaps with a Court proceeding taken by the Commissioner against Mr Harris for an amount of approximately $26,000.00.
 Accordingly, for present purposes, the Court needs to be satisfied that the relevant transactions involve insolvent transactions of the Company entered into in the relevant period, in this case in the period between 8 March 2005 and 8 September 2005.
 Having regard to the liquidator's affidavit sworn 27 August 2008 and filed on 2 September 2008, I am satisfied that the Company was insolvent when the six payments were made in the period 5 May 2005 to 27 June 2005.
 The report as to the Company's affairs filed by the Company on 25 November 2005 ("MAC5" to the liquidator's affidavit filed 2 September 2008) records unsecured creditor claims of $182,000.00: Schedule F, Australian Taxation Office (PAYG withholding liability - $26,000.00; GST liability $106,000.00); Schedule H, three creditors $21,000.00, $5,000.00 and $24,000.00.
 The liquidator deposes to his opinion as a chartered accountant (para 10 of his affidavit filed 2 September 2008) that the Company was insolvent at the time the payments were made to the Commissioner and that the Company was insolvent for the entire six months prior to 8 September 2005.
 I am also satisfied having regard to the affidavit of Stuart Greig sworn 19 September 2008 and filed on 22 September 2008 that $67,731.18 of the sum of $116,830.00 paid by the Company to the Commissioner was applied in satisfaction of PAYG withholding obligations under subdivision 16-B of Part 2 - 5 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act .
 The second matter concerns the question of whether either Mr Harris or Mr MacKellar has a defence under any subsection of s 588FGB of the Act to the Commissioner's claim.
 The second and third defendants pay interest pursuant to s 52 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) on the judgment debt of $67,731.18 from the date the first defendant makes payment of the said sum to the first plaintiff, at the rate of 8% per annum.
