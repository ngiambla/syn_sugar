 It is alleged by Safari that the Safari Snorkels are physically recognisable and can be distinguished from other snorkels in the Australian market place without the need to refer to the Safari trade mark.
 The first respondent, Ironman 4x4 Pty Ltd ('Ironman') imports distributes advertises offers for sale and sells snorkels which have a similar design and appearance to some models of the Safari Snorkels ('the Ironman Snorkels').
 Evidence was sought to be introduced mainly through an affidavit sworn on 16 October 2009 by David Edward Inall (the Engineering and Marketing Manager of Safari) as to certain testing of the Ironman Snorkels by independent engineers.
