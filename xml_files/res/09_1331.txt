 This is an application which is brought by Mr Bryan Kevin Hughes, as Liquidator of Firepower Operations Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) under s 596A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for the issue of an examination summons to Mr Timothy Francis Johnston.
 The distinction is of some importance because the range of persons who are eligible to be examined pursuant to an application made under s 596B is considerably wider than those who may be examined pursuant to an application made under s 596A.
 In support of the application made under s 596A , the applicant relies upon an affidavit of Ms Kazi Mai Lyn Klopper which annexes a company search of Firepower Operations Pty Ltd.
