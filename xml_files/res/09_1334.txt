 The parties then settled on a description of native title holders having satisfied themselves that the description accurately reflected the position as described in the connection materials provided by the applicant to the State and captures all native title holders.
 A similar situation where the final description of the native title holders was altered between application and determination arose in Billy Patch and Others on behalf of the Birriliburu People v State of Western Australia [2008] FCA 944.
 Numerous decisions of the Federal Court have emphasised that provisions such as s 87 and s 87A of the Native Title Act are designed to facilitate and encourage the resolution of native title claims by agreements between parties.
 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I congratulate the Thudgari People, the State of Western Australia and all the other parties who, together, with the assistance of the mediator --- the National Native Title Tribunal --- have been able to reach the agreement which has given rise to the application for the proposed determination before me today.
