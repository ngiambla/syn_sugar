 Numerous decisions of the Federal Court have emphasised that provisions such as s 87 and s 87A of the Native Title Act are designed to facilitate and encourage the resolution of native title claims by agreements between parties.
 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I congratulate the Thudgari People, the State of Western Australia and all the other parties who, together, with the assistance of the mediator --- the National Native Title Tribunal --- have been able to reach the agreement which has given rise to the application for the proposed determination before me today.
