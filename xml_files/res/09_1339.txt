 As the Federal Magistrate said in [36]-[37] of the reasons: [ 36 ] In the present case, it is clear to me that the present Tribunal also did apply his mind to that issue, and there is no evidence before me suggesting that genuine consideration was not given to the applicant's request.
 As I pointed out above, the Tribunal was in a difficult position to embark on questioning the two proposed witnesses, since it had no indication of the evidence which it was being invited to elicit from the witnesses.
 As to the fourth ground, I agree with the Federal Magistrate's conclusion at [45] that it was pertinent for the Tribunal to take into account that the fact that the appellant's brother, who was said to have been a member of a Sikh political party, had remained in India and had not been ill-treated.
