 This is an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal pursuant to Order 52, r 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules .
 In his Honour's reasons for decision of 1 October 2008 the Federal Magistrate, after referring to the Tribunal's acceptance of the applicant's basic claims, recorded that it was unfortunate that the applicant did not have the benefit of legal assistance.
 Apart from the applicant's submissions (which, as is not uncommon in these matters, the Federal Magistrate found to be of no real assistance), the Federal Magistrate identified two issues of concern in the Tribunal's reasons.
 Equally importantly, the Federal Magistrate discerned one potential issue in the Tribunal's reasons which could not have been discerned by the applicant given his lack of English and legal representation.
