 The notice of appeal related to a decision of the AAT given on 20 August 2009 refusing an extension of time under s 29(7) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ( the AAT Act ).
 The decision which Ms Light sought to review in the AAT was made by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ( the SSAT ) on 28 May 2009 and published on 9 June 2009.
 Under ss 29(1)(d) and 29(2) of the AAT Act the prescribed time for the making of the review application in the circumstances of Ms Light's case was 28 days from the date on which the SSAT's decision was given to her.
 It appears to contain a correct analysis of statutory provisions which provide that Ms Light lost her entitlement to a parenting payment and family tax benefit from the time her daughter received the Youth Allowance back dated to the first notional payment date of 9 July 2008.
