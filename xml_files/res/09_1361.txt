 Here, though, the latest and last event of non-compliance persuades me that these Respondents --- the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents --- are either unable or unwilling to accept the fact that, as I have stated, directions are not aspirational statements.
 For completeness, I should mention that it was raised on behalf of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents that the proceedings themselves were stayed under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) given that, apparently, the First and Second Respondents are in liquidation.
