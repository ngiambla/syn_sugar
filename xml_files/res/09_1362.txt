 Seminars International Pty Ltd (Seminars International) was wound up at the behest of the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) following a failure on its part to comply with a statutory demand in respect of various revenue law debts owed to the Commonwealth of Australia and payable to the Commissioner.
 On 18 June this year, the liquidator sought an order against the Commissioner pursuant to s 588FF of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) for the payment of the sum of $125,471.40.
 The evidence further establishes that the Commissioner has incurred the following disbursements in relation to the application brought against Mr Davies, namely: a filing fee: $288; a fee for attempted personal service: $46; and a fee for the filing of the substituted service application: $288.
 Because the Commissioner appeared by an officer authorised in that behalf pursuant to the Taxation Administration Act , rather than by either the Australian Government Solicitor or some other person entitled to the payment of professional costs, there can be no order in respect of professional costs.
