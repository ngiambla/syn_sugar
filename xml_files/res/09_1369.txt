 The provisional grant followed a decision by the Authority that the first respondent satisfied the condition for registration as an eligible person for the grant of a quota fishing right and a determination as to his entitlement.
 The first respondent was advised of the total number of SFRs provisionally granted to each eligible person under the Management Plan and the composition of that number, including the shark quota SFRs granted to him.
 On 18 April 2007, the Authority wrote to the first respondent acknowledging his application for registration as an eligible person for the grant of SFRs for shark species in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery and advising him that he had been registered as an eligible person.
