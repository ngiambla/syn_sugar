 The plaintiff sought leave to file three categories of expert evidence, but in the course of argument this afternoon, has modified the claim as set out below.
 These proceedings were commenced on 29 November 2007 and the Statement of Claim which was prepared was obviously prepared with meticulous and comprehensive thoroughness.
 The plaintiff was initially represented by Messrs Atanaskovic Hartnell, solicitors, but on 5 November 2008, the plaintiff withdrew instructions from that firm and instructed Messrs Piper Alderman.
 There was some delay in Piper Alderman obtaining the plaintiff's file from the former solicitors and the file was not obtained until 5 January 2009.
 Second, tracing evidence relating to the use of funds which were allegedly obtained improperly by the first defendant, Murchison Metals Limited, through the Cadetta contract or Cadetta arrangement.
 The valuation evidence which is sought in relation to what has been called the "Cadetta deal" is set out in [81] of the Statement of Claim: 81.
 What Heydon J there said is that justice is the paramount consideration in determining such an application, and this may not necessarily result in complete justice to the party who is in default.
 However, in Black Decker (Australasia) Pty Ltd v GMCA Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1623 , Finkelstein J observed at [2] that: [P]arties do incur losses resulting from delay that can never be compensated by a costs order.
 It seems to me that I am entitled to infer that a decision must have been taken by the former solicitors that expert evidence was not to be called on that issue, particularly in light of the fact that it is an alternative to the primary claim made in [81].
 The second reason is that this is a commercial cause in which serious allegations are made by a publicly-listed company against the first defendant, which is also a publicly-listed company and against the other parties to the proceedings.
