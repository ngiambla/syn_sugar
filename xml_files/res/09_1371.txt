 The Tribunal asked the appellant why she believed she was still of interest to the authorities despite the fact that they had not looked for her in such obvious places as the homes of close relatives.
 CONSIDERATION The first ground relied on by the appellant was that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the decision of the Tribunal was affected by a reasonably apprehended bias.
 Plainly enough, however, the Tribunal's questions at the hearing would have made the appellant aware that the Tribunal was treating her sister's claim as relevant to the assessment of her own.
 Having rejected this possibility, it was thus open to the Tribunal to conclude that, on the evidence before it, the similarities in the claims were indicative of fabrication and should not be accepted.
