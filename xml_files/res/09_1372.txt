 That article was dated 2 July 2008 and hence was issued a few weeks before the submission on behalf of the appellants was lodged with the Tribunal on 1 August 2008.
 However, as discussed at the hearing on 6 August 2008, what the Tribunal has to look at is whether there is a real chance that you or your wife or your son will be persecuted for one or more of the five Convention reasons if you return to Sierra Leone now or in the reasonably foreseeable future.
 It is true, as the Minister submitted, that the Tribunal had given the appellants an opportunity to establish that they might be subject to violence if they returned to Sierra Leone.
 Rather, the important matter is that the absence of evidence upon which the Tribunal acted was a direct result of the Tribunal not indicating to the appellants that it would not accept the article of 2 July 2008 unless corroborated by the SLPP.
