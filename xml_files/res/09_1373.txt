 In the Federal Magistrates Court, Lucev FM delivered oral reasons for judgment on 16 November 2009, making orders including, relevantly, an order that the applicant's application for injunctive relief be dismissed.
 On that day, the applicant filed a notice of appeal in this Court, appealing the dismissal of the application for an injunction and seeking an urgent injunction restraining the first respondent from removing the applicant at 3.50 pm that day.
 In fact, the applicant was not removed from Australia on 16 November 2009 and, but for his appearance today, he remains in immigration detention at the Perth Immigration Detention Centre.
