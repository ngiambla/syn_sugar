 The paragraph, insofar as it does concern hearsay, does nothing more, in my opinion, than provide a foundation - an identified foundation - against which Dr Mallen-Cooper came to furnish particular advice.
 Of substance, though, is that Dr Mallen-Cooper's statement was provided in early August, well prior to the time when Dr Kind and Mr Tait came to confer in accordance with the pre-trail direction.
 Further, and also of substance, is the fact that it is apparent that Mr Tait was, prior to that expert conference, and certainly prior to his giving evidence, seized with, in full, Dr Mallen-Cooper's statement.
