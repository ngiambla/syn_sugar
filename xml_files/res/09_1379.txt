 Section 254J provides in subs (1) that a company may redeem redeemable preference shares only on the terms on which they are on issue, and that on redemption the shares are cancelled.
 The plaintiffs contend that Pisces assumed an absolute obligation to redeem, whereas Pisces contends that its obligation to redeem was subject to the availability of profits or of the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purposes of the redemption.
 It referred to the agreement of Pisces to issue 1.5 million CRP Shares to acquire all of the issued shares in MDS, and then stated: "The Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares are issued on the following terms and conditions".
 It is arguable that it confines attention to the terms and conditions set out at [27] above, being the terms and conditions in the document that was attached to the special resolution of 8 September 2006.
