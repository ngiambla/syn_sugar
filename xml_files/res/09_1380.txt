 On the basis of the information available to it, the Tribunal at [58] expressed itself not satisfied that the first appellant would be denied adequate state protection for any Convention reason including religion.
 His Honour considered that while the Tribunal did acknowledge the possibility of religious-based discrimination in Malaysia, its discussion on that topic formed part of a broader consideration of human rights in Malaysia.
 It is correct, as counsel for the appellants points out, that the broader discussion by the Tribunal at [57] of its reasons did not deal specifically with the appellants' allegations of differential treatment by the Malaysian authorities.
 Federal Magistrate Cameron could see no error in the Tribunal's approach and I see no error in his Honour's reasoning in concluding that there is no basis for the appellants' submission that the Tribunal did not give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to their claims.
