 On 30 October 2009 Professor Terry wrote to Cooper Grace Ward listing further new allegations and enclosing a schedule of relevant entries from the diary notes of Walter Williams, the company secretary of QTAC, which entries referred to Ms Jones.
 On 3 November 2009 Professor Terry emailed Ms Jones informing her that, in order to permit Ms Jones time to respond to allegations against her, the QTAC Board meeting (which would require preparation of papers by Ms Jones) would be postponed.
 In this case Ms Jones has established at least a sufficient likelihood of success in claiming that the commencement of the investigation by QTAC and the subsequent conduct of the investigation were prejudicial or disadvantageous to her position as an employee.
 In my view Ms Jones has established a prima facie case that this correspondence, and the proposed meeting, constituted threats to terminate Ms Jones' employment, which in itself is adverse action pursuant to s 342(2) of the FW Act. 6.
