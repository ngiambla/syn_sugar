 Submissions of the respondent In summary, Mr Griffin QC for the respondent submitted that: The decision in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 does not support the proposition that forbearance to sue in matrimonial proceedings is of no commercial value and therefore not consideration within the meaning of s 120 of the Bankruptcy Act .
 Second, even had such inconsistencies not existed between the terms of the financial agreement and the terms of para 10 and para 24 of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim, I consider that the reliance by the respondent on her financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage as consideration for the transfer of the relevant properties is untenable.
 This is because the consideration pleaded by the respondent in para 10 and para 24 of the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim "depended on factors which cannot provide a basis for assessing the value of the consideration which was given" (Whitlam and Jacobson JJ in Lopatinsky [2003] FCAFC 109 ; (2003) 129 FCR 234 at 250).
