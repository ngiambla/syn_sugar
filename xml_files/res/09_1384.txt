 On 10 September 2007, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") made a decision, affirming a decision of the respondent, refusing to give the appellant access to any documents other than those it had already given him.
 The Tribunal said that Mr Atkins and the respondent were not required to take any action until a valid request was received on 13 February 1998.
 The appellant characterised the Tribunal as defiant, unrepentant or recalcitrant, and said that it had failed to appreciate the significance of the word "all" in s 24A of the FOI Act.
