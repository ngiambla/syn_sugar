 By Amended Notice of Motion dated 24 November 2009 the Internet Industry Association ('the IIA') seeks leave pursuant to O 6 r 17(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') to intervene in these proceedings to the extent of making oral and written submissions.
 Thirdly, it is submitted that the IIA can offer assistance in respect of a range of policy issues concerning the formulation of the safe harbour provisions; how the industry has interpreted and applied such provisions since its incorporation; the consequence of the submissions of the applicants upon the internet industry and internet consumers; and the technical infrastructure, standards and operation of the internet.
 The applicants have submitted that the submissions which the IIA would rely upon if granted leave to intervene duplicate the submissions already made by iiNet and accordingly there is no utility in granting leave for the IIA to intervene.
