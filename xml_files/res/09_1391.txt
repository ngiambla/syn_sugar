 By Amended Notice of Motion dated 24 November 2009 the Internet Industry Association ('the IIA') seeks leave pursuant to O 6 r 17(1) of the Federal Court Rules ('the Rules') to intervene in these proceedings to the extent of making oral and written submissions.
 Pursuant to a previous order of the Court, written submissions in support of the application and written submissions providing the detail of the submissions sought to be made by the IIA, dated 17 September 2009 and 11 November 2009 respectively, have been supplied to the Court and to the parties.
 IIA SUBMISSIONS In support of its motion to intervene, the IIA submits that the proceedings raise significant questions of law concerning the following: (a) the interpretation of section 112E of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ( Copyright Act ) which relates to the authorisation of infringement by use of certain facilities; (b) what constitutes "reasonable steps" for an ISP to prevent or avoid the doing of infringing acts under section 101 of the Copyright Act; (c) the meaning of "repeat infringer" under section 116AH of the Copyright Act; (d) the significance of "a person" infringing copyright under section 101 of the Copyright Act ; and (e) the interpretation of 116AH(2) of the Copyright Act regarding any requirement on a carriage service provider to monitor its service, including by reference to the interpretation and effect of section 276 of the Telecommunications Act 1979 (Cth).
 The IIA submits that the proceedings constitute a ' test case ', being the first time Part V Division 2AA of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) ('the Copyright Act ') ('the safe harbour provisions') will be considered in detail.
 Such knowledge is said to arise because the IIA was involved in the formulation of the safe harbour provisions when the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement was under negotiation culminating in the US Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 2004 (Cth), such Act being the source of the amendment to the Copyright Act inserting the safe harbour provisions.
 The IIA has also submitted that it was acknowledged in the Revised Explanatory Memorandum to the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 1999 (Cth) as being an important contributor to the formulation of that Bill which became the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act 2000 (Cth).
 In short, the IIA submits that it is ' in a position to advance useful submissions in the public interest on the proper construction of certain provisions of the Copyright Act ' (see Sharman Networks Ltd and Others v Universal Music Australia Pty Limited and Others [2006] FCAFC 178 ; (2006) 155 FCR 291 at [14] . ) It appears from the submissions dated 11 November 2009 that the IIA's final submissions are primarily directed towards four aspects of the proceedings before the Court: the interpretation of s 112E of the Copyright Act ; what effect (if any) the AFACT notices should have on an internet service provider's ('ISP') liability for copyright infringement; whether such notices should lead to the termination and/or suspension of customer accounts; and the correct interpretation of the safe harbour provisions.
 Mr Coroneos, in his cross-examination, acknowledged that he had not personally compared the submissions of the IIA to those provided by iiNet given that the final submissions of the IIA were drafted before the final submissions of the parties.
 IceTV Pty Limited Anor v Nine Network Australia Pty Limited [2008] HCATrans 356 was one, wherein the High Court of Australia granted leave to interveners on the ground that the Court ' may be assisted ' by them (per French CJ).
 Reliance is also placed upon the decision of Kirby P in Breen v Williams (1994) 35 NSWLR 522 at 533 in which the President said: The courts should not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to the assistance that they might receive from amicus curiae on matters of principle in test cases.
 The Court is satisfied that the limited intervention sought would not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the hearing given that no further oral or written submissions are sought to be advanced (O 6 r 17(2)(b)) and that there are no other relevant matters for determination (O 6 r 17(2)(c)).
 In Australian Securities Investments Commission v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd (No. 3) [2007] FCA 393 , Jacobson J found that he was not satisfied that the contribution of a group which he described as a ' lobby group ', namely the Australian Financial Markets Association ('AFMA'), would contribute to the proceedings in a way which was ' useful or different from the contributions of the parties ' (see [12]).
 The submissions sought to be relied upon by the IIA regurgitate in substance the submissions provided by iiNet which deal, in significant detail, with the subject matters concerning the safe harbour provisions; s 112E of the Copyright Act ; and the concept of copyright authorisation considered in the context of the AFACT notices.
