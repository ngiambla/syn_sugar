 Prior to Ms Devers commencing paid employment with Focus, Ms Devers and Ms Van Opijnen did not ask Focus to provide qualified interpreters or any other facilities, including flashing lights, to assist Ms Devers in her employment.
 Similarly, Ms Haynes gave evidence that Ms Devers asked Ms Dunn at a staff meeting to secure an interpreter for the DHS training and that Ms Dunn said she would obtain approval from Ms Foster.
 In cross-examination, Ms Devers said that she accepted the arrangements because of the short notice and her belief that, as a volunteer, she had no other choice.
 Ms Devers said that this request was the result of her concern that an interpreter would not be booked, but the evidence indicates Ms Devers's willingness to use staff members as interpreters at training sessions.
