 A further 40% of that area of the screen in that heater is illuminated by less intense reflected light, and the remaining part of that area of the screen (20% to 30%) is not illuminated at all.
 All experts agreed that some of the flame shaped images observable on the viewing screen from the front of the heater were transmitted to and created on that screen by reflected light.
 Rather, most of the light travelling to the viewing screen from those devices is light which is directly emitted from the light source via the cylinder and the flame shaped cut out plate.
