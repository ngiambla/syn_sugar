 Mr Capocchiano and Great Wall also admitted that Mr Rafeletos was not appointed a co-director of Great Wall and that he was not transferred a 50% shareholding in Great Wall.
 Mr Rafeletos said that, on a Sunday in early March 2002, he picked up Daniella from her apartment in Mortdale and they travelled down to the Yallah Property, where Daniella introduced Mr Rafeletos to her father.
 He told Mr Rafeletos that the Yallah Property was 90 odd acres and that there was a development application in respect of a 19 block subdivision.
 In response to an enquiry as to the structure of Great Wall, Mr Capocchiano told Mr Rafeletos that he was the sole director and that he and Daniella had shares in Great Wall.
 Mr Rafeletos said that, after they had walked over the Yallah Property, he told Mr Capocchiano that he loved the property and that he wanted it.
 Mr Rafeletos said that, after the discussion with his father, he spoke to St George Bank again and said that he wanted to borrow $200,000 instead of $300,000.
 There is no contemporary objective evidence to support the assertion by Mr Rafeletos that he originally asked St George Bank for $300,000 and then varied his application.
 Mr Rafeletos also asserted that he was engaged in negotiations for the sale of lots in the subdivision of the Yallah Property and that he had signed transfers.
 Mr Rafeletos said that he subsequently spoke to Mr Reid and told him that he was supposed to be a director from the beginning and was supposed to have 50% of the shares.
 Mr Rafeletos said that he subsequently spoke to Mr Capocchiano and told him that Mr Reid was preparing all the paperwork for the directorship and the 50% shareholding and that he would bring them down for Mr Capocchiano to sign.
