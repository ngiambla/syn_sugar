 On 17 September 2007, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory entered into a "Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government: Indigenous Housing, Accommodation and Related Services September 2007" (the MOU).
 On 18 March 2008, a meeting was convened between the Minister and the Council representatives (including their solicitors) to discuss the options for resuming negotiations for the development of the Alice Springs town camps.
 On 9 January 2009, the Minister wrote a letter to each of the Housing Associations urging them to progress consideration of the proposed subleases as soon as possible, so that construction could commence as soon as possible.
 The Minister proposed a meeting between the Council's Executive, Housing Association representatives and interested town camp residents on 24 March 2009 (which was subsequently rescheduled to 23 April) to assist with the progress of the negotiations.
