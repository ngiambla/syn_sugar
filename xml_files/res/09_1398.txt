 Going behind the judgment The power of a court on an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice to "go behind the judgment" on which the bankruptcy notice is based is a discretionary power.
 In an appeal from a judgment involving the exercise of discretion, the question for the appeal court is not whether it would have exercised the discretion differently from the court below.
 My finding that there is a substantial reason for questioning whether the County Court judgment is based on an actual debt leads to the conclusion that the discretion should be exercised in favour of setting aside the bankruptcy notice.
