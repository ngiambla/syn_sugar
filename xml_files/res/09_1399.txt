 On 30 October 2009, for reasons which I then gave ex tempore, I adjourned the hearing of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation's (Deputy Commissioner) application for the winding up of Bedroff Pty Ltd ACN 079 158 955 (the company) to 24 November 2009: see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Bedroff Pty Ltd ACN 079 158 955 [2009] FCA 1266.
 It was not at that early stage a patent absence of a basis for satisfaction that it was in the interests of creditors for the company to continue under administration; cf Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v WPS Motorsport Pty Ltd (2009) 71 ACSR 640.
 The deed of removal and appointment does not make any express provision for the indemnification by FUFM from the trust fund of the Barr Trust of liabilities incurred by the company in the ordinary course of its prior administration of that.
 Again, the absence of any discrimination in the administrators' draft report as between the claims of those such as the Deputy Commissioner who were and remain creditors of the company and those such as Mr James Tonge who, as beneficiaries, have a claim against the trust fund (such as it may be) of the Barr Trust is a significant omission.
 Further, even this amount and the further statement in para 12.12 of the draft report that the administrators had "received a claim from Mr Mark Tonge in the amount of $300,000 for unpaid wages" is at odds with the statement in para 12.11 of the draft report where the administrators note that, "the company did not have any employees and therefore no employee entitlements are outstanding".
 The present extent of information as to the dramatic change since then in the company's fortunes is that the administrators have been advised that "a number of the assets and liabilities have been paid out since [the 2006 accounts] were prepared' and that "the values will have altered due to property prices".
