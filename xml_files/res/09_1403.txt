 The Tribunal commented that, according to the appellant, the lawyer was hostile and uncooperative towards the appellant and had told the appellant that a case did not exist in the courts.
 The Tribunal noted that the appellants did not provide any information to the Tribunal regarding the lawyer or the courts in Latvia which would enable the Tribunal to conduct further investigations to verify the appellants' claims.
 The appellants asserted in the grounds of the application that they had requested the Tribunal to contact their lawyer to verify their claims, as the Tribunal accepted, and that they were ready to provide the lawyer's contact details to the Tribunal.
 The indications available to the Tribunal were that, even if it had the contact details, the lawyer would not assist the appellants nor provide the details of the appellant's alleged court case.
