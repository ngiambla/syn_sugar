 King J in the Victorian Supreme Court was an appeal from an order of a master giving leave to sign final judgment in an action asking for judgment for a debt due to the Commonwealth of Australia and payable to and recoverable by the Deputy Commissioner under the 1936 Act.
 The Part consisted of five Divisions which bore the headings: Division 1 --- Introduction Division 2 --- Interpretative Provisions Division 3 --- Taxation Objections Division 4 --- AAT Review of Objection Decisions and Extension of Time Refusal Decisions Division 5 --- Federal Court Appeals Against Objection Decisions Section 14ZL(1) of the Administration Act provided a connection between Part IVC of the Administration Act and s 175A of the 1936 Act.
 Section 177(1) operates as between the Commissioner and the taxpayer served with the notice of assessment in a proceeding between them and the notice of assessment issued to another taxpayer does not qualify or affect the operation of s 177(1) (per Brennan J in Richard Walter at 202).
