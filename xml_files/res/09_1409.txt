 S J Salisbury Investments Pty Ltd filed a notice of appearance in the proceeding in its capacity as a contributory of the company and it opposed the application on the ground that the company was not insolvent.
 In all these circumstances, it seems to me that the evidence does not support a conclusion that Mr Salisbury's purpose, let alone his predominant purpose, in appointing the administrators was to gain control of the company through the issue of shares.
 There is no doubt that Mr Salisbury's action in paying out the substantial debt owed to the Bank was a significant step and it was followed by the appointment of the administrators.
