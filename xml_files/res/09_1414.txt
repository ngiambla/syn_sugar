 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant was a citizen of China but did not otherwise accept the appellant's claims, finding that he was not a credible witness and did not appear to know much about Christianity in China.
 The Tribunal also found that the appellant's lack of knowledge of the church he attended in Sydney meant that it could not be satisfied that the appellant had attended that church other than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee.
 The Tribunal was concerned that the appellant displayed a lack of understanding of this "basic tenet" of this Church's teaching when he referred to Mr Ng as a priest.
