 Mr Carroll said that the closing down of the mill and the liquidation of the Company had an immediate negative impact on the value of the stock and prevented the orderly sale of the timber by the Company.
 Mr Carroll had twenty years experience in the timber industry whereas Mr McLellan had no experience with timber mill businesses prior to his appointment as administrator of the Company and this administration was his first timber mill business.
 However, on closer analysis these matters do not support the proposition that on 31 December 2005 and during the relevant period there were not reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Company was insolvent.
 Having regard to Mr Bright's qualifications, (par [34] above) experience and particular experience in the timber industry, which Mr Carroll knew, it was reasonable for Mr Carroll to rely on what Mr Bright told him.
