 The second issue is that the Scheme Implementation Agreement (SIA) dated 13 September 2009 between ERC and ECC provided for payment of a break fee by ERC to ECC of $4 million, which was 1.9% of the equity value of ERC.
 In addition, cl 4.3 of the Scheme requires that five business days after the Record Date (Implementation Date), the Cash Consideration is to be deposited by ECC in a trust account in the name of ERC, to be held on trust for the relevant Scheme Participants before their ERC shares are transferred to ECC under the Scheme.
