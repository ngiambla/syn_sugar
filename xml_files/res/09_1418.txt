 The second issue is that the Scheme Implementation Agreement (SIA) dated 13 September 2009 between ERC and ECC provided for payment of a break fee by ERC to ECC of $4 million, which was 1.9% of the equity value of ERC.
 Performance risk A Deed Poll has been executed by ECC and its guarantor, STTC, in favour of each Scheme Participant, in order to make ECC's obligations under the Scheme and STTC's guarantee that ECC will perform those obligations, enforceable directly by the Scheme Participants.
 In addition, cl 4.3 of the Scheme requires that five business days after the Record Date (Implementation Date), the Cash Consideration is to be deposited by ECC in a trust account in the name of ERC, to be held on trust for the relevant Scheme Participants before their ERC shares are transferred to ECC under the Scheme.
 I did not consider that the absence of a recommendation from the ERC directors in relation to the Scrip Consideration alternative stood in the way of the making of an order for the convening of the meeting of Scheme Participants.
