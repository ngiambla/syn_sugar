 In his first judgment, Phipps FM dismissed an application by the appellants that he disqualify himself from hearing an application to review a decision of a Registrar of the Court below made on 25 May 2009 ("the First Judgment"); see McKinnon v Pattison [2009] FMCA 695.
 The substantive application before Phipps FM was for an extension of time under s 33(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act") for the appellants to give a taxing officer notice of their wish to have the costs and remuneration of their trustee in bankruptcy taxed pursuant to reg 8.09 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) ("the Regulations").
 In the second judgment, his Honour dismissed the application for review and ordered the appellants to pay the costs of that application and the costs before the Registrar ("the Second Judgment"); see McKinnon v Pattison [2009] FMCA 696.
