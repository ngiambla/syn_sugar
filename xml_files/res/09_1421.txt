 Consideration of the exercise of the discretion In determining whether to grant the extension of time requested by the appellants it is necessary to take into account a number of factors, in addition to the futility factor.
 The fact the appellants have provided a reasonable explanation as to why they failed to comply with the requirements of reg 8.09(1) is a matter which weighs in favour of granting an extension of time.
 Second, the time lapse between the date by which the appellants should have lodged their notice under reg 8.09(1) and the date by which they applied for an extension of time under s 33(1)(c) was only about three months.
