 In Prime Forme, Brooking J disagreed, saying that the fact that the party seeking security had substantial means or was liable to be sued because of its business or profession was irrelevant.
 His Honour considered (at p 32) that s 533(1) of the Companies (Victoria) Code (a predecessor of s 1335(1) of the Corporations Act ) should not be viewed as a provision designed to protect those unable to protect and cover themselves against the costs of litigation.
 It is difficult to avoid the impression that if the parties had taken a little time for cool and calm consideration of their respective positions, the contest over security may have evaporated.
 Beazley J concluded that the question for her to decide was whether the respondents should be deprived of the provision of security such as cash or a charge over assets merely because such an offer had been made.
