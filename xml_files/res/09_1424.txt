 Mr Atkinson deposed that he had attended meetings in Canada in October 2009 where it emerged that representatives of the banks advising ASSAC made it clear that it was unlikely that ASSAC would be able to raise sufficient funds to satisfy the requirements of cl 3.1(d) of the merger implementation agreement unless White Energy made significant financial concessions regarding the merger consideration.
 As a consequence, said Mr Atkinson, an agreement has been entered into between ASSAC and White Energy terminating the merger implementation agreement and releasing each other from any obligations and liabilities arising under that agreement.
 Mr Pendlebury has submitted that there would be no utility in holding the meetings in light of the fact that there is no further intention or obligation on behalf of ASSAC to proceed with the merger which was contemplated in the scheme.
 Mr Pendlebury has referred me to a number of authorities which deal with the power of the Court to order that the orders for the convening of the meetings which were made on 15 October 2009, be revoked.
