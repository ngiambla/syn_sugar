 The definition of "residential premises" in the GST Act is to be found at s 195-1: residential premises means land or a building that: (a) is occupied as a residence or for residential accommodation; or (b) is intended to be occupied, and is capable of being occupied, as a residence or for residential accommodation; (regardless of the term of the occupation or intended occupation) and includes a floating home.
 Under that sub-paragraph it is necessary to show that the property was "intended to be occupied, and [was] capable of being occupied as, a residence or for residential accommodation".
 The applicant put forward quite a different construction of the definition of residential premises to support his submission that both properties were "intended to be occupied, and [were] capable of being occupied, as a residence or for residential accommodation".
 The new definition requires that for the land to be considered residential premises it must be intended to be occupied, and capable of being occupied, as a residence.
