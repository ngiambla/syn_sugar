 Power of the Court to make the order sought In applying for security, the respondents have relied on s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') and Order 28 of Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) ('the Rules').
 Mr Weston noted that this provision requires "credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful".
 In these circumstances, it does not appear to me that Mr Weston's assertion that the parties have had a business relationship since 2001 provides any answer to the respondents' evidence concerning its lack of assets or residence (or other real presence) within the jurisdiction.
