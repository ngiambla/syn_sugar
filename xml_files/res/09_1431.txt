 The respondents say that the notice was not simply misdescribed but rather, Phillip Mills, deposed that the meeting acknowledged a description of Kulkagal Torres Strait Islanders as that group of persons descended from the four nominated ancestors and that elders from three of those families attended the meeting.
 The meeting was said to have confirmed that under the traditional laws and customs of Nagilgual People important decisions are made by elders, and that there were sufficient elders present at that meeting to make a decision to appoint a new applicant in place of Mr Alfred Mills.
 Phillip Mills said that his reference to Wagub in the earlier affidavit did not affect the representation of the Nagilgaul People at the meeting of 10 August 2009 because those people who attended the meeting and who were descended from Wagub are more accurately described as descended from "each of Sorogo and Wagub".
