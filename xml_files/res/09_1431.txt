 The respondents say that the notice was not simply misdescribed but rather, Phillip Mills, deposed that the meeting acknowledged a description of Kulkagal Torres Strait Islanders as that group of persons descended from the four nominated ancestors and that elders from three of those families attended the meeting.
 Phillip Mills said that his reference to Wagub in the earlier affidavit did not affect the representation of the Nagilgaul People at the meeting of 10 August 2009 because those people who attended the meeting and who were descended from Wagub are more accurately described as descended from "each of Sorogo and Wagub".
