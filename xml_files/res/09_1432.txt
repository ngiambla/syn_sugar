 Mr Byrnes said that the Macquarie Companies were facing an $800 million write-off, and that the professional indemnity insurance of the directors of BrisConnections might not cover the losses.
 The claim for interlocutory relief was for a declaration that the call for the second and third instalments be deferred until final determination of the proceeding.
 Late in the afternoon of 24 April 2009, Messrs Whittens, who were acting for Mr Byrnes, sent an email to Freehills, attaching a copy of the application and statement of claim that had been filed.
