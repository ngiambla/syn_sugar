 The Federal Magistrate noted that the Tribunal did not rely on the degree of state protection in coming to its conclusion that the first appellant did not face a real chance of persecution.
 The Tribunal's findings are substantially to the effect that the first appellant did not have a significant involvement in politics in Sri Lanka, and for this reason did not face a real chance of persecution.
 It was clearly open to the Tribunal to conclude that the first appellant's involvement in politics was minor and not relevantly significant, having regard, amongst other things, to his mistake about there being a general election in 2003.
