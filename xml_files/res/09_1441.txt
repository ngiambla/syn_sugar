 The central issue in this case is whether the Respondent contravened s 52(1) of the Act by engaging in conduct that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive.
 The vouchers did not entitle their holders to holidays of any description and the false representation conveyed by the scratch card to that effect was misleading and deceptive and likely to mislead or deceive.
 It follows that most people who claimed their prize were required to incur subscription and other costs in order to do so which substantially exceeded the value of the prize they had won.
 Secondly, the Applicant says that the Respondent should also be required to publish corrective advertisements in the newspapers and magazines in which the Respondent caused the scratch cards to be included in the first place.
