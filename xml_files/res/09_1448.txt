 In Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd [1976] AC 443 the House of Lords held that where a contract provides for a monetary obligation to be paid in foreign currency, the judgment ought be given in that currency.
 So, for example, where damages consist of expenses incurred in the currency of the contract, the award should be made in that currency: Federal Commerce and Navigation Co Ltd v Tradax Export SA (The Martha Envoy) [1977] QB 324.
 These allegations made it necessary for BHPB to call expert evidence on English law (the law of the charterparty) and Thai law (the place where the Global Hawk was to discharge its cargo).
