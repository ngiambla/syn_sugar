 CONSIDERATION The proceeding and the legislation On 3 July 2009, Edmonds J made an order under s 62M of the Act in proceeding NSD 592 of 2009 that AFAL be placed under judicial management and an order under s 62R(1) of the Act appointing Mr Smith as judicial manager.
 On or about 19 December 1995, AFAL entered into an underwriting agreement with Triton Underwriting Insurance Agency Pty Ltd (Triton) and Mercantile Mutual Assurance (Australia) Limited (Mercantile) under which Mercantile was to take the role of lead underwriter for any business that was written.
 On an adjusted basis, there is a deficiency in the order of approximately $1,023,900, and that does not take into account Mr Smith's fees as judicial manager and other costs associated with the judicial management (see [29] below).
 APRA consented to the making of an order under s 62S(1)(b) of the Act that it pay the remuneration and allowances of Mr Smith in his capacity as judicial manager of AFAL, including, but not limited to, his costs and expenses of the present proceeding.
