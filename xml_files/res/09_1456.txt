 HPM alleges that TROM, TROM's Liquidator, Merilbah and Merilbah's Liquidators have sought funding from the investor-debtors to enable a challenge to be made to the validity of the assignments and therefore to HPM's title to sue on them.
 TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators are to carry out and conduct enquiries and investigations into HP Mercantile's right, title and interest to the loan debts for the [eight] projects ...
 TROM and/or Merilbah is to acquire all right, title and interest in the loan debts due under Investor Loan Agreements if HP Mercantile's right, title and interest is successfully invalidated or set aside.
