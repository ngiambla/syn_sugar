 Dr Mackay then said that after he had prepared the second "written report", he received from Dr Adsett the report which he had commissioned from Dr Adsett in relation to the cardiac condition of Mr Johnston.
 I do not regard the documents signed by Dr Mackay as affording a reasonable cause excusing Mr Johnston from attending Court in compliance with the examination summons on any of the three days on which he has not attended.
 Secondly, Dr Mackay issued the notes notwithstanding that he had not yet received the report from Dr Adsett to whom he had referred Mr Johnston for an examination and assessment of his cardiac condition.
 However, before Dr Adsett's report was even received, Dr Mackay had issued two medical notes to Mr Johnston saying he was not to fly in any circumstances for, in one version, two weeks, and in the other version, three weeks.
