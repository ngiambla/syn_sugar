 The Narnoobinya applicants filed their application on 4 June 1997 but have not taken any steps to file evidentiary material or points of claim or in any other way sought to progress their claim in the Court, although they have been involved in mediation conducted in the Native Title Tribunal.
 The Narnoobinya applicants ceased to be party to the Ngadju application in November 2006 as result of failure to comply with an order of the Court in the Ngadju proceeding that they file an address for service.
 Whilst the Narnoobinya applicants have had some involvement in mediation in the Native Title Tribunal in the Ngadju matter, the only action taken by them since November 2006 in the Court is to seek to restore their position as having party status in the Ngadju claim.
 Merits of the dismissal application The only formal step taken by the Narnoobinya applicants in their own proceeding is to contest the dismissal application in the course of seeking rejoinder to the Ngadju application.
