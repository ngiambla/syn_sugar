 DLA Phillips Fox holds in its trust account: (a) $150,000.00 as security for Garth Living's costs; and (b) $150,000.00 as security for Cohen's costs of the proceedings.
 It seeks those orders because it contends that Bitech unreasonably rejected an offer of settlement made by Flameglow which offer was clearly substantially better than the outcome of the proceeding.
 Further, I consider that it is an unrealistic and overly technical approach to regard Bitech's infringement claim and the issues raised by Flameglow in its Cross-Claim as being wholly separate actions or proceedings.
 In my view, the usual order should be made, that is to say, that Hotpoint, being unsuccessful in the prosecution of its Cross-Claim, should pay Bitech's costs of that Cross-Claim.
