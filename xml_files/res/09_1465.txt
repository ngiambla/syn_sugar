 Order 10 r 1(2)(f) of the Federal Court Rules empowers the Court to "... direct that the proceeding be transferred to a place at which there is a Registry other than the then proper place.
 If that party or another party wishes to have the proceeding conducted or continued in another place he may apply to the Court for an order under s 48 or O 10 r 1(2)(f) or O 30, r 6 as the case may be.
 This is because of the different wording of s 5(1) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW) ("the Law Reform Act") which provides for the recovery of contribution from joint tort-feasors.
