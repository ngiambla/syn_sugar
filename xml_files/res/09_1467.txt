 Euroceania contended that the arrest and the proceedings in rem were brought against the " Gem of Safaga " as a surrogate ship for the " JBU Onyx " and " JBU Opal ".
 On 2 February 2007 Tedross and West Asia, through Mr Joshi, signed a memorandum of agreement using the BIMCO Saleform 1993 for the purchase of the ship at a price of USD13,600,000.
 West Asia argued that it did not have the sole power to dispose of the " Gem of Safaga " because of Four M's registration of its one share and s 25(d) of the Indian Act.
 Mr Mitter expressed the opinion that neither West Asia nor Four M could sell separately the respective nine shares or one share that they held, no doubt because of s 25(d) of the Indian Act.
