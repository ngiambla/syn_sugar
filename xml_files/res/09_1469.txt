 Another motivation was the need for the parties to have an opportunity to assimilate lengthy reasons for judgment in respect of appeals raising a plethora of issues in respect of which each party had enjoyed mixed success before making submissions in respect of costs.
 That provisional conclusion was that the powers exercisable by the Court in the circumstances obtaining in respect of the 2001 income year did not extend to the setting aside of the decision disallowing the objection, the making of an order setting aside the assessment concerned and the making of a declaration that Mr Russell's taxable income for that income year was $1869.23 higher than that assessed.
 Thus, in the present case, the Commissioner did not contend that this section authorised the issuing of an amended assessment so as to give effect to the conclusion which I had reached as to the income tax assessment for the 2001 income year had not been shown to be excessive because it understated Mr Russell's true taxable income for that year.
 That position was adopted even though then, as now, this Court is empowered on the hearing and determination of an appeal against an objection decision, to "make such order in relation to the decision as it thinks fit, including an order confirming or varying the decision": see s 14ZZP of the TAA, which replicates a like conferral of power found at the time of the ANZ Savings Bank Case in the then s 199 of the ITAA 1936.
 Section 200B of the ITAA 1936 was one of the provisions introduced into the ITAA 1936 by the Taxation Boards of Review (Transfer of Jurisdiction) Act 1986 (Cth) (Transfer of Jurisdiction Act) to which I made reference in my earlier reasons for judgment.
 The latter decision might result in the confirmation or varying of an assessment but it remains an assessment by which the taxable income and the tax payable thereon is, in the absence of further challenge, fixed for a given income year.
 Again accurately, the Commissioner noted that, with respect of the income tax penalty appeal, Mr Russell had success to the extent that: (a) the uplift of 20% was not pressed by the Commissioner [as notified at an early stage in the Commissioner's Appeal Statement filed on 20 December 2007 (see para 31)]; and (b) the base penalty was reduced to 25% and the base penalty liability was remitted in full.
 As to the goods and services tax appeal, the Commissioner conceded that Mr Russell had enjoyed success to the extent that: (a) the resident agent amount was not pressed by the Commissioner [as notified at an early stage in the his Appeal Statement filed on 21 February 2008 [see para 13(a)]; (b) the Court had determined that Mr Russell is entitled to input tax credits in relation to the farm forestry enterprise (although this success was limited to the extent that the partnership carried on such enterprise only until 23 February 2004).
 The Commissioner noted, accurately, that Mr Russell's goods and services tax penalty appeal had failed to the extent that he had not secured any reduction in the base penalty concerning the alleged accounting practice enterprise and in respect of remission of the partnership's base penalty liability in respect of that alleged enterprises and the alleged naturist retreat enterprise.
 Were I to have made an order remitting the matter so as to enable the making of an amended assessment increasing Mr Russell's taxable income, I should also have had to set aside the objection decision insofar as it related to that year and to declare what was his true taxable income for that year.
