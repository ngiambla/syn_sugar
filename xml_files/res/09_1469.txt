 Power to make orders authorising an assessment increasing taxable income The Commissioner's submission was that, for the reasons which I had set out in my earlier reasons for judgment, the provisional conclusion which I then reached in my earlier reasons for judgment (at para 177) was correct.
 The latter decision might result in the confirmation or varying of an assessment but it remains an assessment by which the taxable income and the tax payable thereon is, in the absence of further challenge, fixed for a given income year.
 Again accurately, the Commissioner noted that, with respect of the income tax penalty appeal, Mr Russell had success to the extent that: (a) the uplift of 20% was not pressed by the Commissioner [as notified at an early stage in the Commissioner's Appeal Statement filed on 20 December 2007 (see para 31)]; and (b) the base penalty was reduced to 25% and the base penalty liability was remitted in full.
 As to the goods and services tax services tax penalty appeal, the Commissioner conceded that Mr Russell had enjoyed success to the extent that: (a) the uplift of 20% was not pressed by the Commissioner, but that this concession as notified as early as 21 February 2008 in the Commissioner's Appeal Statement filed: [para 13(b)]; (b) the penalty referable to the resident agent amount was not pressed (again as notified in the Commissioner's Appeal Statement filed on 21 February 2008): [para 13(a)]; (c) the penalty relating to the farm forestry operations will correspondingly be eliminated; and (d) the base penalty in respect of the naturist retreat has been reduced to 50%.
