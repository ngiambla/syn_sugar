 In considering these instructions the Tribunal commented: The ACIs further provide that the applicant must have "personally engaged in activities overseas beneficial to the interests of Australia, not just, for example the company or organisation for which the applicant worked".
 Mr Mautner's evidence was that it was necessary for him to reside in Thailand in order to develop and carry out his business but that he intended to return to Australia permanently once the business had reached a sustainable level.
 There is, however, a clear distinction between the Tribunal rejecting a claim because, on the weight of the evidence put to it, it is not satisfied that the claim is made out and the Tribunal rejecting evidence because it believes that evidence to be fabricated.
 In the former case it would generally not be necessary for the Tribunal to advise the claimant that the evidence is not sufficient and, expressly or by implication, invite him or her to provide additional evidence.
