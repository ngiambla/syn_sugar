 Accordingly the trustee is entitled to costs in respect of its notice of motion to strike out various paragraphs of the Defence and its opposition to the Cross-Claim, and also in respect of Mrs Jensen's application for leave to file the Amended Defence and Cross-Claim.
 Submissions of Mrs Jensen In summary, Mrs Jensen submitted as follows: The trustee has been successful in respect of two applications --- namely the application brought by Mrs Jensen for a stay, and the trustee's application to strike out parts of the defence and counterclaim.
 The appropriate order for costs at this stage is that costs be reserved to the trial judge because the trial judge will be in the best position to determine, on a review of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, whether one or other of the parties had acted unreasonably.
 While the trustee had, appropriately, commenced these proceedings in this Court and had a prima facie right to have his claim heard in this Court, Mrs Jensen was well within her rights to apply for an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court.
