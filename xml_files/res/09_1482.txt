 The appropriate order for costs at this stage is that costs be reserved to the trial judge because the trial judge will be in the best position to determine, on a review of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings, whether one or other of the parties had acted unreasonably.
 While the trustee had, appropriately, commenced these proceedings in this Court and had a prima facie right to have his claim heard in this Court, Mrs Jensen was well within her rights to apply for an order that the proceedings be transferred to the Family Court.
 I do not agree that Mrs Jensen sought, unsuccessfully, to have the proceedings transferred to the Family Court at the hearing of 31 March 2009 --- in fact although counsel for Mrs Jensen invited the Court to make the order of its own initiative, no formal application for transfer was made.
