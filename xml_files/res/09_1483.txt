 In consideration of the transfer of Felix shares by each scheme participant to Yanzhou, each participant would receive a cash payment of $16.95 from Austar for each Felix share held.
 Mr Polson assessed whether the proposed scheme is in the best interests of shareholders by adopting a test of whether the scheme is either fair and reasonable, or, not fair but reasonable, or, neither fair nor reasonable, in accordance with ASIC Regulatory Guide 111.
 Mr Polson assessed the total proceeds payable to a scheme participant under the scheme (including the scheme consideration; the first dividend; the second dividend; and the SAC dividend) at AUD18.05 per Felix share.
