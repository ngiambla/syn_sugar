 Claim for serious misfortune and period of serious misfortune The Panel noted that the word "misfortune" is not defined in the Management Plan and considered that it must "be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary and natural meaning".
 The Panel finds that, on the whole of the evidence, Kennedy has established a serious misfortune claim for [the] period from February 1998 to November 1998 and from July 1999 to April 2000".
 Mr Kennedy contended that it was not appropriate to fasten upon the word "all" in s 27(1)(c) and 27(1)(d) and treat it as though it governed the construction of s 27 as a whole.
 The construction advanced by Mr Kennedy was that the references to "all" were to "all sequences of a particular kind", old longline or old minor line, during the period under examination.
