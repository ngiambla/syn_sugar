 Having established the formalities, the applicants first raise a 5 March 2002 notice of CASA issued by it under s 268(1) (the first notice) to suspend Mr Repacholi's pilot licences pending investigation after a takeoff executed by him at Jandakot Airport in Western Australia, on 10 January 2002.
 The complaint in relation to the notice which was served on Mr Repacholi is a failure on the part of CASA to comply with its statutory obligation under CAR 268(2) to conduct 'an investigation' into the facts and circumstances associated with the takeoff and to complete the investigation promptly.
