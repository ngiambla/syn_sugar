 The consequence of those breaches has been, it is argued, that the respondents are liable in damages to the applicants for breach of statutory duty, breach of a duty of care and in the case of the individual or proposed individual respondents, for misfeasance in office.
 Having established the formalities, the applicants first raise a 5 March 2002 notice of CASA issued by it under s 268(1) (the first notice) to suspend Mr Repacholi's pilot licences pending investigation after a takeoff executed by him at Jandakot Airport in Western Australia, on 10 January 2002.
 The complaint in relation to the notice which was served on Mr Repacholi is a failure on the part of CASA to comply with its statutory obligation under CAR 268(2) to conduct 'an investigation' into the facts and circumstances associated with the takeoff and to complete the investigation promptly.
 It is said that the notices were, in the case of the second and third notices, made 'without jurisdiction'; made in excess of authority of individual persons; were knowingly made in excess of authority; were made in breach of CASA's duty of good faith; or, alternatively, made negligently.
