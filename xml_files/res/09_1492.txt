 HP Mercantile Pty Limited, the first applicant named in the Further Amended Interlocutory Process, claims that the resultant debts owed by the several taxpayers to Tumut in respect of the various schemes were duly assigned to three companies, namely Core Finance Pty Limited, Symsung Pty Limited and Treetop Projects Limited, that those companies in turn assigned the debts to Merilbah Investments Pty Limited (formerly known as Bejemi Pty Limited and Arnott-Smith Holdings Pty Limited) ('Merilbah') which, in turn, assigned them to HP Mercantile Pty Limited.
 The projects I am principally concerned with are: - the Tumut River Orchard projects of 1991 and 1992; - the Coonabarabran Orchard project of 1993; - the Queensland Orchard project of 1994 - the Treetop project of 1996; - the Treetop Plum project of 1996; - the Treetop Apples project of 1997; and - the Harcourt Vines project of 1997.
 A liquidator of Tumut might reasonably expect that anyone seeking to enforce the payment of the relevant debts would be able to provide information as to the existence of the debts, the validity of the assignments thereof to Core Finance Pty Limited, Symsung Pty Limited or Treetop Projects Limited as the case may be, the cost of recovering debts said to have been lawfully assigned and the perceived value of such debts.
