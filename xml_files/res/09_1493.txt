 The applicants' solicitor has deposed in an affidavit relied on in support of this application that Mitre 10 may be considering further offers which compete directly with the first applicant's proposal.
 I am advised that Mitre 10 held meetings on Monday, 7 December 2009 and that further meetings are to be held today which may lead to the parties negotiating and seeking to agree upon an Implementation Agreement.
 The respondent on the other hand would say that the status quo was his right to communicate with people (shareholders/franchisees) who might be affected in the future by the way in which the applicants conduct their business.
