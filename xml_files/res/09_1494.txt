 A considerable part of Hamilton's defence of AMC's claims in this respect was directed at denying AMC's beneficial ownership of any of these and at establishing misleading or deceptive conduct in relation to alleged representations concerning the marks and Chinese language translations: see FAD paras 17-30.
 In that part of the matter that AMC lost --- its own claim --- AMC can be said to have proceeded with unrealistic expectations, at least in relation to the quantum of contract damages it sought.
 Save in relation to the breach of confidence action and one specific issue mentioned below, the justice of the matter is, rather, that not only that no indemnity costs order should be made on AMC's claim in Hamilton's favour but also no costs order should be made on the claim or the cross-claim.
