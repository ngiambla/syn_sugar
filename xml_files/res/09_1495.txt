 Mr Allam also gave evidence that Mr Channa had approached him in around August 2006 at the Botany Premises and showed him a bundle of blank Aristocrat compliance plates that he had procured from Behong.
 Mr Irarrazaval attributed that difficulty to the high number of counterfeit gaming machines being sold in Peru at prices significantly below the prices at which the Aristocrat companies were able to offer genuine refurbished gaming machines.
 Mr Ogborne also sought to attack one part of Mr Irarrazaval's evidence in which he identified a number of Global/Impact customers to which sales may have been made by the Aristocrat companies.
