 The Commissioner, however, submitted that the relevant decision not to postpone the time requirement in the further notice was made by Mr Trewin, as recorded in para 10 of his affidavit; further, that the decision as made is recorded in the letter of 27 November 2009 from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to Mr McKeough.
 Mr Krok requested a postponement of the requirement for his attendance to the date of 22 February 2010 on the basis that he would make himself available to give evidenced on that date.
 The Commissioner, via his delegate, refused to do so knowing that Mr Krok would not be in the country on the nominated date of 16 December 2009 because of his planned departure from Australia on 14 December 2009.
 As the Commissioner also submitted, there is no principle of law that if the Commissioner cannot prove urgency then a decision not to postpone as requested must be affected by Wednesbury unreasonableness.
