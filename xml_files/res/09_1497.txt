 Mr Krok requested a postponement of the requirement for his attendance to the date of 22 February 2010 on the basis that he would make himself available to give evidenced on that date.
 The Commissioner, via his delegate, refused to do so knowing that Mr Krok would not be in the country on the nominated date of 16 December 2009 because of his planned departure from Australia on 14 December 2009.
