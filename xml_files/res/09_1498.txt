 The original Malanbarra Yidinji People's application was lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal (the Tribunal) on 21 August 1994 and an application by George Davis on behalf of the descendants of Jimmy Longdon, members of the Dulabed Aboriginal Corporation, was lodged with the Tribunal on 23 February 1995.
 With the assistance of the Tribunal, the parties have reached agreement as to the terms of the determination for the purposes of s 87 and s 94A of the Act that native title exists in respect to the Determination Area as described in the s 87 Agreement that was filed on 30 November 2009.
 Power of the Court Pursuant to s 13 of the Act, applications for the determination of native title may be made to the Federal Court in relation to areas for which there is no approved determination of native title.
 In order to establish that there are today native title holders, it must first be established that, at the time of sovereignty, a society of persons bound together by observance of traditional laws and customs existed.
