 THE NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING The respondents, the Australian Federal Police (the AFP) and the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (the DCT) have applied to have this proceeding summarily dismissed, and have also filed a Notice of Objection to Competency of 23 September 2008.
 The circumstances, at least at that level of generality, appear to be the same as those applicable to the decision of the fifth "respondent" (and of the AFP and the DCT, as alleged in paras 9.8 and 9.9 of the amended application).
 His Honour decided that the decision to swear the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant and to apply for it were not decisions of an administrative character made under an enactment: see s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.
