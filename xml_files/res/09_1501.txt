 In particular, the question is whether the Tribunal has power to compel the recipient of a request for access to documents to make an actual decision in response to the request.
 The general effect of questions 1 and 2 was narrowed by Ms Bienstein's oral arguments to the question whether the Tribunal had power to order the Attorney-General and the Minister to make decisions on Ms Bienstein's requests for access to documents.
 This decision was based on a finding that all reasonable steps had been taken by each of the Attorney-General and the Minister to find the documents Ms Bienstein sought and that, except for the documents that had been located and dealt with previously, the documents to which Ms Bienstein requested access did not exist.
