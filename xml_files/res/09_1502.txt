 On 6 July 2009 Senior Counsel for ASIC informed me that there were of the order of 110 documents produced by KPMG which needed to be examined by ASIC to determine whether it wished to make a claim for public interest immunity in respect of any of them.
 I have reached the conclusion that the redaction and masking undertaken by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents goes beyond the redaction and masking which is necessary in order to ensure that the documents do not have a tendency to disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC.
