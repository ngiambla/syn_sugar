 On 25 June 2009 Registrar Moore ordered that the order made on 21 April 2009 requiring ASIC to file and serve an affidavit setting out the basis of any claim for public interest immunity to be stayed until fourteen days after the handing down of my judgment in relation to ASIC's claim for public interest immunity in relation to documents produced by it in respect of which the applicants had sought inspection.
 On 6 July 2009 Senior Counsel for ASIC informed me that there were of the order of 110 documents produced by KPMG which needed to be examined by ASIC to determine whether it wished to make a claim for public interest immunity in respect of any of them.
 In respect of the second tranche documents: (a) ASIC does not object to inspection by the applicants of the documents numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 50, 52, 54, 55, 58, 60, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 72, 75 over which documents ASIC previously made a claim based on the confidentiality of Mr Stuart Cummins' identity as an informer; (b) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over the whole of the documents numbered 25 and 49; (c) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over parts of the documents numbered 6, 8, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 29, 32, 33, 37, 38, 40, 44, 46, 47, 48, 51, 53, 56, 57, 61, 67, 70, 71, 73, 74 and 76.
 I have reached the conclusion that the redaction and masking undertaken by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents goes beyond the redaction and masking which is necessary in order to ensure that the documents do not have a tendency to disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC.
