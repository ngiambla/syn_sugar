 The amended statement of claim made reference to a number of the written terms I have set out but made no reference to that part of the offer which referred to the terms and conditions offered superseding "all others" or to the applicant's executed acknowledgment to that effect.
 The respondents claim, in light of the uncontradicted evidence they have produced, showing the written offer of 18 March 2008 and executed acceptance dated 19 June 2008, that the asserted express or implied representations were not incorporated into the applicant's current contract of employment and they are not estopped from so arguing.
 That legal framework may not deny to the applicant an argument that, notwithstanding the execution of the written contract, it was supplemented by further oral terms or the respondents were estopped from denying that it was.
