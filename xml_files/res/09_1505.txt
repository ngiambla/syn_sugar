 In Wilkshire v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 1222 I ordered that the application made by Mr Wilkshire under s 88 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) be summarily dismissed under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 For my own part I would be reluctant to order indemnity costs pursuant to O 23 r 11 on a motion for summary dismissal unless an award of indemnity costs is itself warranted by the principles informing the judicial discretion to award such costs.
