 In Wilkshire v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 1222 I ordered that the application made by Mr Wilkshire under s 88 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) be summarily dismissed under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
 The second relies upon an offer of compromise being made under O 23 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules , it being contended that, the application having been dismissed summarily, Mr Wilkshire obtained a result less favourable than the terms of the offer of compromise dated 4 June 2009 which was made to him.
 For my own part I would be reluctant to order indemnity costs pursuant to O 23 r 11 on a motion for summary dismissal unless an award of indemnity costs is itself warranted by the principles informing the judicial discretion to award such costs.
