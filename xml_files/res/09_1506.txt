 The section provides: "12DL Unsolicited credit cards and debit cards (1) A person must not send another person (the targeted person ) a credit card or a debit card except in accordance with subsection (2).
 This protective function, prevents a significant addition of a very different use that would change the defining characteristic of the operation of the card without the cardholder making a written request for that change.
 Of course, if such a change has been authorised, a card that can be used dually as a credit and debit card, will be able to be renewed, replaced or substituted by sending the cardholder "a card of the same kind" as referred to in s 12DL(2)(b).
