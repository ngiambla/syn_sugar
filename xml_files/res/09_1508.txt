 The Commissioner contended that the evidence was inadmissible because s 53B of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Federal Court Act) precluded the admission into evidence of anything said during the course of a mediation conference ordered by the Court.
 Mansfield J went on to find that s 131(2)(h) of the Evidence Act applied to evidence of the offers and counteroffers made during the course of the mediation conference and he admitted into evidence the affidavits in question.
 Further, in Silver Fox , Mansfield J did not deal with the mediation conference in that case on the basis that it was a mediation conference to which s 53A and s 53B applied.
