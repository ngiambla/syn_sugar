 The sole ground of the application is that the Tribunal erred in law and committed a jurisdictional error in determining that it had jurisdiction to review a specific decision of the applicant.
 The second respondent contends that the Tribunal was correct in finding that the reconsidered decision was a "reviewable decision" within the meaning of s 7.1 , and that any other interpretation lends itself to producing an absurdity.
 The context in which the phrase appears in section 7.1 The more complex question however is whether, in the broader context of the statutory scheme, "variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited" includes a decision by the applicant not to vary its previous decision.
 The intention of Parliament appears clearly in the words used --- a reconsideration decision is reviewable when the accreditation body varies (either up or down) the period for which a residential care service is to be accredited.
