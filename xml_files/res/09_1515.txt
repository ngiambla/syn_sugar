 To the extent that employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace, including an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive, it could not be said that the respondent had been entirely remiss in taking steps to ensure the safety of its workers prior to the incident.
 It was therefore entirely foreseeable that: It appears that, apart from the radio, the only other method of communication between workers in front of the transportation unit in the position of Mr Grech and Mr McCallum, and other workers, was for workers in the position of Mr Grech and Mr McCallum to physically run to the rail and attempt to attract the attention of other employees.
 I agree with Comcare that the inherent unreliability of that method, and the time delay involved in implementing it, could have, and in this case did, lead to a fatal delay in stopping the transportation unit in an emergency.
 As the respondent submits, and I also note, Madgwick J in Comcare v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] FCA 662 ; [2007] 163 FCR 207 listed no considerations favourable to a respondent in respect of assessment of penalty.
