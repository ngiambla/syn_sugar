 Similarly, Mr Hu gave another notice pursuant to s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) on 1 October 2009 alleging various constitutional issues arising from a directions hearing on 22 September 2009 before me.
 The decision challenged in these proceedings, made pursuant to s.6 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 , is that the Commonwealth Ombudsman would not investigate a complaint made on 20 March, 2009 by Mr Hu against an officer of the Migration Agents' Registration Authority. 2.
 Fourth, and significantly, it is in fact clear from the decision of the Federal Magistrate that his Honour identified and considered all grounds in s 5 of the ADJR Act sought to be advanced by Mr Hu.
 The reasons for deciding not to investigate Mr Hu's complaint are clear and cogent. (at [33]) No material has been placed before me in these proceedings to persuade me that the decision of his Honour was attended by error such that an appeal should be allowed on this ground.
