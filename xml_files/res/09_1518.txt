 The Respondents produce the documents identified and described in Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Respondents' Amended List of Documents filed 14 October 2009, pursuant to Order 15A rule 10 of the Federal Court Rules .

 The order which the applicants seek in paragraph 2 of the Motion was particularised prior to, and then during, the submissions, by the identification by the applicant of six categories or classes of documents which, they submit, should be the subject of an order for further and better discovery.
