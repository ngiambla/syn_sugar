 By the amended application, Mrs Coshott also sought, pursuant to s 41(6A) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act'), that time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice be extended 'pending the outcome of [her] Notice of Motion filed on 23 October 2009 in proceeding 4000/09 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney'.
 The notice had been served on Mrs Coshott on 10 October 2009. (2) The amended application in these proceedings was filed on 29 October 2009 prior to the expiry of the Bankruptcy Notice, and (it should be inferred) was also filed before the making of the order extending time.
 But there is a threshold difficulty with the application to extend time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice because of the temporal limitation in para (2) of Mrs Coshott's amended application: ... pending the outcome of the Applicant's Notice of Motion filed on 23 October 2009 in proceeding 4000/09 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney.
 The delay in the commission of the act of bankruptcy, if ultimately the requirements of a bankruptcy notice are not complied with and a sequestration order is made, by an extension of time to comply with a bankruptcy notice may therefore have significant consequences to the creditors of the bankrupt.
