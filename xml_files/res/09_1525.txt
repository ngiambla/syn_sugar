 By decision dated 8 th August 2008 the SSAT set aside the decision of 20 th May 2008 and substituted a decision that: (i) the Applicant's Carer Payment be suspended rather than cancelled from 7 th May 2008; and (ii) the Respondent further consider the raising of the debt and the amount of any such debt in accordance with certain directions of the SSAT.
 By decision dated 10 th August 2009, and having considered the material provided in the course of the Tribunal hearing, the Respondent cancelled the Applicant's Carer Payment and affirmed the earlier decision to raise and recover the said debt.
 The apparent presupposition in both decisions --- consistently with the Tribunal's decision --- was that Mr Cosenza, having not complied with the s 63 notices, was a person to whom, for s 80(1) purposes, the social security payment was not payable.
