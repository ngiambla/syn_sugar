 The plaintiffs complain that since 1 April 2009 Mr Matheson has conducted the businesses without reporting any information to them about the trading and operation of the businesses and they have not received any of the takings.
 The interlocutory orders which the plaintiffs seek require a significant alteration to the conduct of the two businesses and the exclusion of Mr Matheson and those associated with him who are presently managing and controlling the two businesses.
 A significant number of the complaints they make sound in money terms, that is to say, stock removed and not paid for, stocktakes showing discrepancies, and payments to and receipts by the businesses not being accounted for.
