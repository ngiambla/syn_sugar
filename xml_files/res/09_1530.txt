 The Tribunal considered the documents and country information provided by the appellant and noted that the country information details the generalised instability in the NWFP and Swat in particular although it did not refer to the appellant or his wife's situation or to the issuance of fatwas.
 The Tribunal noted that the documents relating to the appellant's marriage to his wife and his wife's previous marriage (provided to the Tribunal) did not in themselves provide corroborative evidence of his claims of persecution as a result of that marriage.
 One might say that it is unlikely often to be the case that the Tribunal will state expressly that it "considers" that particular information "would be the reason" or even "would be a part of the reason" for affirming a decision made.
