 Mr Chamberlain should, however, have declined to enter into the Indemnities until either the Court's approval was obtained, or Ms Farmer was persuaded, perhaps by counsel's opinion, that her own view that approval was required had been erroneous.
 In favour of a grant of approval now are the considerations noted in the Earlier Reasons that, when the Indemnities were entered into, the DCT was the only creditor of the Company that had lodged a proof of debt and that it was the creditor that was providing the funding.
 Ms Farmer did tell Mr Graham at that meeting, however, that Mr Chamberlain had sought funding to pursue the Transactions Proceeding by the DCT, and that he was awaiting a reply from the DCT, as he had been since February 2007.
