 It is pertinent, though, to recall particularly the penalties that were imposed by me on 23 October 2009, and to try and achieve relativity as between those penalties and the ones to be imposed in respect of Jobspy and Mr Moles.
 Mr Maughan, on whom I imposed a penalty of $1.25 million, had a lower level of responsibility in directing contravening conduct than Mr Owen or Mr Salcedo, upon each of whom I imposed a penalty of $3 million.
 The formal orders, then, apart from the penalties that I have imposed, will be in terms of those made on 23 October 2009, and I direct the Authority to bring in minutes of orders to incorporate the same.
