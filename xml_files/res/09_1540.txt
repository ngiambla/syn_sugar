 So I consider that it is not inconsistent, as a matter of logic or principle, for there to be a different costs order depending upon whether a defence under s 588H of the Act succeeds, or whether relief is granted pursuant to s 1317S of the Act.
 The defendant should be ordered to pay the plaintiffs' costs of and incidental to the proceeding, including any reserved costs, save for the costs reserved in relation to the interlocutory proceeding which was filed on 12 October 2007 seeking freezing orders against the defendant and his wife, Louise Margaret Carroll.
