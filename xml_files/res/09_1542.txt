 The Tribunal is not bound by any "best evidence" rule and can rely on secondary evidence, as it is described in curial proceedings, of the contents of documents: see s 420(2).
 If a translated document provided by an applicant bears upon the claim of the applicant and the Tribunal is to have regard to it, the Tribunal can either accept the translation or independently seek to verify its accuracy.
 No jurisdictional error, it is considered, is exposed simply by reason of the fact that a claimant seeks to rely upon documents written in a foreign language but not translated.
 In the present appeal, no jurisdictional error is disclosed by the fact that numerous newspaper articles were not translated and were returned to the now Appellant at the conclusion of the hearing.
