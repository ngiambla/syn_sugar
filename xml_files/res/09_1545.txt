 THE REPRESENTATIONS It is convenient to briefly describe the representations that the ACCC alleges constitute misleading and deceptive conduct or false and misleading statements, contrary to ss 52 and 53(eb) of the TP Act.
 The ACCC says that the certificate of authenticity representations are untrue because the artworks and paintings were not painted by a person of Aboriginal descent and were not painted by Ubanoo Brown.
 It is almost an oxymoron to contend, as ADC and Mr Antoniou did, that authenticity in conjunction with the word "Aboriginal" conveyed that the paintings may have been painted by a person of non-Aboriginal descent, in a style of Aboriginal art.
 I have also found that the paintings were painted either by Mr Goodridge or by other persons who were not of Aboriginal descent and by persons who did not identify themselves and were not known as Ubanoo Brown.
