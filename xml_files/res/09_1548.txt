 This case was originally to proceed today for the contested hearing of an application made by a Delegate of the Registrar of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations (the Registrar), Mr Armstrong, for the winding up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation for Welfare Services (the Corporation).
 Since then, and as revealed by an affidavit of Justin David Ericson, filed and read today by leave, very considerable efforts indeed have been made to give order to the affairs, including the financial affairs, of the corporation.
 He came to hold that office as a result of deliberate decisions taken responsibly by the Corporation to put its affairs in order following what one might term the "wake-up call" administered properly by the Registrar in respect of its governance.
 What the parties propose is a regime in terms of draft orders submitted, whereby the Corporation will be given time to file an affidavit which evidences the formal contractual relations having been entered into as between the Corporation and the National Australia Bank as presently apprehended.
 Subject to the filing of the affidavit by 15 January 2010, it is then proposed that orders in the form of an annexure to the order proposed be signed by each of the parties and then lodged with the Court for the making of a further order by consent about a week following the date proposed for the filing of the affidavit.
 Those orders provide for the Corporation to give an undertaking in respect of the notification to the Registrar of various key events in respect of the governance and financial performance of the Corporation for a period which will end on 31 December 2011.
 That discretion is one which may only be exercised if I am satisfied that special circumstances justify the extension of the period ordinarily prescribed by that section for the determination of a winding up application and further if the order is made within that ordinary period or as last extended.
 I am satisfied, having regard to the matters to which I have averted and which are more particularly detailed in Mr Ericson's affidavit, that special circumstances do indeed exist for the making of the orders proposed, which include, particularly, provision for the extension of the period within which the application for winding up must be determined until 9 July 2010.
