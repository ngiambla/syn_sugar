 He came to hold that office as a result of deliberate decisions taken responsibly by the Corporation to put its affairs in order following what one might term the "wake-up call" administered properly by the Registrar in respect of its governance.
 Those orders provide for the Corporation to give an undertaking in respect of the notification to the Registrar of various key events in respect of the governance and financial performance of the Corporation for a period which will end on 31 December 2011.
 I am satisfied, having regard to the matters to which I have averted and which are more particularly detailed in Mr Ericson's affidavit, that special circumstances do indeed exist for the making of the orders proposed, which include, particularly, provision for the extension of the period within which the application for winding up must be determined until 9 July 2010.
