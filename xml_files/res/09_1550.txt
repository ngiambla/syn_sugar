 In their respective income tax returns for the 2000 income year, the Taxpayer and Rothmans chose rollover pursuant to subdivision 126-B in relation to the CGT events that occurred by reason of the disposal by the Taxpayer to Rothmans of the 9 Wills Brands.
 Rothmans Holdings, Rothmans Asia and Rothmans were all members of the Rothmans Holdings group and, accordingly, it was open for Rothmans Holdings and Rothmans Asia to transfer net capital losses to Rothmans.
 Further, the regional organisation resulted in the crystallisation of capital losses on the part of Rothmans Asia and Rothmans Holdings in amounts almost equal to the capital gain attributable to the disposal of the 9 Wills Brands.
