 Notwithstanding continuing reservation as to the manner in which the Further Amended Statement of Claim is expressed, it is nevertheless not considered that those reservations provide a sufficient basis upon which the discretion conferred by O 8 r 3(2) should be exercised adversely to the Applicant.
 Such evidential material as is now before the Court, it is concluded, provides an adequate basis upon which the Court can be satisfied that: (i) the Court has jurisdiction in the proceeding; (ii) the proceeding is of a kind mentioned in r 2, being a proceeding of a " kind " falling within Item 1, 2, 3, 6(b), 11 and/or 12; and (iii) the Applicant has a " prima facie case " for the relief claimed.
 The evidence upon which that state of satisfaction has presently been reached is the Affidavits of Michael Daniel Harmer affirmed on 30 November 2009, 2 December 2009 and 11 December 2009 together with exhibits to his Affidavit of 30 November 2009, being Exhibits MDH 8, 63, 64 and 65.
