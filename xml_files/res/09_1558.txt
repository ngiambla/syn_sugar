 When I enquired of Mr Bevan whether it might not be more appropriate for such evidence to be given by one of the directors of the Respondent, I was informed that they too had left for Ireland.
 One matter of significance that emerged from the parties' written submissions was the fact that the Respondent is apparently able to send a "corrective" SMS to each person who sent an SMS in response to the invitation conveyed by the scratch cards.
 The way in which the case was presented by the parties up until the time those written submissions were filed suggested to me that such messages could only be sent to those people who continued to subscribe to the Moby Planet service.
 The written submissions filed by the Respondent suggest that I make an order requiring a "corrective" SMS to be sent to past and present subscribers who took out subscriptions as a consequence of the scratch card promotion.
 But given that the Respondent has informed the Court that it can comply with an order requiring it to do that, I do not think it matters that there is no evidence to that effect.
 As I stated in paragraph 98 of my earlier Reasons for Judgment, in this case an order for corrective advertising should be aimed at bringing the key findings of the Court to the attention of people who took out subscriptions to the Moby Planet service including those people who terminated their subscriptions.
 Since it now appears that this can be achieved by requiring a "corrective" SMS message to be sent to all 114,418 people who subscribed to the Moby Planet service in response to the scratch card promotion, I do not see any justification for an order for corrective advertising in any other form.
 Declare that the publication by the Respondent of the Yellow Scratch Card was conduct, in trade or commerce, that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act in that the front of the scratch card represented to consumers that the available prizes included an Apple 3G iPhone when, in fact, the available prize was an Apple iPod Touch.
 Declare that the publication by the Respondent of the Yellow Scratch Card was conduct, in trade or commerce, that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and was a false or misleading representation with respect to price in contravention of s 53(e) of the Trade Practices Act in that the Yellow Scratch Card represented that the cost of claiming a prize was limited to " standard carrier charges " when, in fact, in claiming their prize, consumers incurred the cost of subscribing to the Respondent's Moby Planet mobile telephone premium content service at a cost of $10 per six days plus the cost of a standard SMS message.
 Order that by no later than 22 January 2010, the Respondent send to all persons who subscribed to the Respondent's Moby Planet mobile telephone premium content services in response to the scratch cards an SMS message, in the following form: [FreeMsg] Federal Court finds MobyPlanet scratch cards misleading after ACCC action.
 Order that the Respondent establish and maintain an accurate summary of telephone calls, SMS messages, emails and other communications it receives from consumers regarding the scratch cards, including the consumer's name and telephone number and which provides details of any action taken by the Respondent in response to such communications.
 Order that no earlier than 9 April 2010 and no later than 16 April 2010, the Respondent file and serve an affidavit made by a director of the Respondent, verifying compliance with Order 8 above and providing an accurate summary of the communications received to date and the action taken by the Respondent in response to such communications.
