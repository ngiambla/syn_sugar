 The way in which the case was presented by the parties up until the time those written submissions were filed suggested to me that such messages could only be sent to those people who continued to subscribe to the Moby Planet service.
 As I stated in paragraph 98 of my earlier Reasons for Judgment, in this case an order for corrective advertising should be aimed at bringing the key findings of the Court to the attention of people who took out subscriptions to the Moby Planet service including those people who terminated their subscriptions.
 Declare that the publication by the Respondent of the Yellow Scratch Card was conduct, in trade or commerce, that was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive, in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and was a false or misleading representation with respect to price in contravention of s 53(e) of the Trade Practices Act in that the Yellow Scratch Card represented that the cost of claiming a prize was limited to " standard carrier charges " when, in fact, in claiming their prize, consumers incurred the cost of subscribing to the Respondent's Moby Planet mobile telephone premium content service at a cost of $10 per six days plus the cost of a standard SMS message.
 Order that the Respondent establish and maintain an accurate summary of telephone calls, SMS messages, emails and other communications it receives from consumers regarding the scratch cards, including the consumer's name and telephone number and which provides details of any action taken by the Respondent in response to such communications.
