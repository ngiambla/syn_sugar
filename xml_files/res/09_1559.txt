 On 31 August 2009, WHK responded as follows: Throughout our engagement all correspondence lead us to believe that Espasia was the beneficial owner of the securities in [the Company], including nomination notices from ASIC.
 This will be based upon the market value of the securities and the voting rights in a general meeting. 7.11 To protect minority shareholders and keep markets informed, the person acquiring the securities will be required to provide a notice of acquisition.
 For those reasons, s 664A(2)(a) was satisfied --- the notes were convertible into shares. s 664A(2)(c) The defendants submitted that Espasia did not hold "full beneficial interests" in at least 90% by value of all the securities in the Company.
 As noted earlier, one of the preconditions to the exercise of the compulsory acquisition power is the requirement that Espasia hold "full beneficial interests in at least 90% by value of all the securitie s" in the Company.
