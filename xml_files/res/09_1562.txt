 The appellant says the question the Tribunal was required to consider was whether Mr Hossain was employed as a Business and Information Professional, not whether he was utilising some of his skills arising out of his qualifications.
 The appellant further says that the Tribunal did not need to enquire further into the responsibilities of a Business and Information Professional because Mr Hossain's tasks fitted exactly within the description of a Bank Worker or Credit and Loans Officer.
