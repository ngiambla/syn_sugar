 However, the Tribunal held that it was not satisfied that Mr Hossain had worked in any skilled occupation: it characterised his position at the Bank as that of a Bank Worker or Credit and Loans Officer.
 Decision of the Federal Magistrates Court Mr Kamruzzaman applied to the Federal Magistrates Court on 13 May 2008 seeking orders quashing the Tribunal's decision and directing the Tribunal to hear and determine the appellant's application according to law.
 The appellant says the question the Tribunal was required to consider was whether Mr Hossain was employed as a Business and Information Professional, not whether he was utilising some of his skills arising out of his qualifications.
 The appellant further says that the Tribunal did not need to enquire further into the responsibilities of a Business and Information Professional because Mr Hossain's tasks fitted exactly within the description of a Bank Worker or Credit and Loans Officer.
