 The immediately material matter is that the Trade Marks Act provides that the applicant may bring an action for infringement of a notified trade mark in respect of the goods the subject of the notice and give notice to the CEO of that action in writing within a period of 10 working days from 23 October 2009, or, if the Chief Executive Officer extends the period under s 137(1) of the Trade Marks Act , within the extended period.
 By operation of s 136 of the Trade Marks Act , the Customs CEO must release the seized goods to their "designated owner" (in this case, the first respondent for the purposes of Part 13 of the Trade Marks Act ) if within the action period (being the period expiring on 23 November 2009) the applicant has not brought an action for infringement of the notified trade mark in respect of the goods, and given notice to the Customs CEO in writing of that action.
 Nevertheless, a question arises as to whether it is appropriate to make an order directed to the Customs CEO preventing the goods from being released, in all the circumstances, in the exercise of discretion, when s 136 imposes a statutory obligation upon the Customs CEO to release the goods in the circumstances there identified and s 137 imposes time constraints.
