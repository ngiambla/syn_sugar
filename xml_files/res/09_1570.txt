 Thereafter, the applicant commenced further proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking a declaration that he was not liable to detention or removal from Australia because his visa application had not been "finally determined" within the meaning of s 198(6)(c)(i) of the Migration Act .
 His Honour read the decisions in Jennings Construction and Smith Kline as being authority for the proposition that an intermediate court of appeal should not be diffident in granting a stay or an injunction in an appropriate case notwithstanding the difficulty that may be occasioned for a member of such a court in making an assessment of the prospect of a grant of special leave in a particular case.
 Ultimately in Papachristopoulos her Honour considered that the Full Court in dismissing the appeal had not identified any point of legal principle with the consequence that the prospect of the grant of special leave to the High Court was "so remote" that no extension of the injunction earlier made in that proceeding should be granted.
 Specifically, insofar as I am aware, the applicant is correct in identifying that the High Court has not yet had an opportunity to consider the legal effect of a discretionary decision on the Minister's power of removal.
