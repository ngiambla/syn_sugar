 First, the applicant served a report from a consulting psychologist with respect to the applicant's current medical condition; the applicant, however, does not intend to rely on this report (see [4] below).
 Second, the respondent says that the evidence is potentially relevant to its defence based on provisions of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) which preclude claims for damages in respect of an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment.
 The difficulty I have with the application is that the applicant has made no claim in these proceedings for any damages arising from an injury, be that injury physical or psychological.
 In circumstances where there is no positive claim by the applicant for any such damage, it does not seem to me that it is a reasonable requirement that, at the suit of the applicant's former employer, the applicant be required to attend a medical examination.
