 The applicant's claim is one for compensation arising out of alleged breaches of a contract of employment and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in connection with the respondent's termination of the applicant's employment.
 First, the applicant served a report from a consulting psychologist with respect to the applicant's current medical condition; the applicant, however, does not intend to rely on this report (see [4] below).
 First, the respondent says that the evidence is potentially relevant to the valuation of the applicant's claim for the loss of the chance to have continued in employment for the respondent until retiring age.
 Second, the respondent says that the evidence is potentially relevant to its defence based on provisions of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) which preclude claims for damages in respect of an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment.
 The difficulty I have with the application is that the applicant has made no claim in these proceedings for any damages arising from an injury, be that injury physical or psychological.
 In short, I accept the applicant's submission that any evidence that is in the applicant's affidavit about his feelings in respect of the termination of his employment cannot be taken as evidence that he is, in fact, suffering from any form of medical condition or injury and, accordingly, could not be used for that purpose.
 In these circumstances, as the proceedings are presently constituted, there is no proper basis upon which I could or would require the applicant to attend a medical examination against his will.
