 The relevant enquiry is as to laws and customs acknowledged and observed by an existing claim group, laws and customs acknowledged and observed by a pre-sovereignty society and the connection between those societies and between the laws and customs, attributable to them.
 The applicant starts with the claim group and its existing laws and customs, and effectively asserts that such laws and customs are traditional because, as it claims, they have been handed down from generation to generation.
 The third conclusion is that: The native title claim group's ongoing observance of traditional laws and customs is consistent with the maintenance of traditional rights and interests in the land subject to the claim.
