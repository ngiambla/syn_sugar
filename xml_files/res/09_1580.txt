 The Court found that, during the period October 2007 to June 2008, Wilson, in the provision of mobile security patrol services, made false and misleading representations to some customers by representing to those customers that Wilson had made the contracted number of security inspections ( Contracted Calls ) to their premises, when in fact, Wilson had not made all those Contracted Calls.
 It was a term of each Contract that: (a) in supplying the Patrol Services, Wilson would make a stated number of Calls at the Customer's premises in a specified service period (Contracted Calls); and (b) Wilson would use its best endeavours to provide the Contracted Calls, however interruptions or delays (or both) caused by break ins at any other Customers' premises and other emergencies including fire, flood, accident, police or emergency service activities may prevent all of the Contracted Calls being carried out during each service period (Permitted Missed Calls).
 ORDERS SOUGHT Where a person has contravened s 52 and s 53(aa) of the Act, in a case such as the present, it is open to the Court on the application of a relevant party to grant relief of the following order: In this case, the parties agree that declarations, injunctions and non-punitive orders should be made under s 86.
