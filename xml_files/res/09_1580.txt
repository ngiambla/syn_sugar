 CONSENT ORDERS On 15 December 2009, at the hearing of the application in this proceeding, I made the following orders by consent of the parties: The respondent (Wilson), from October 2007 to June 2008, in trade or commerce, falsely represented that its mobile security patrol services (Patrol Services) were of a particular standard, quality, value or grade, in contravention of section 53(aa) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (Act) by representing to each of the 322 Customers listed (Customers) in column A of the attached schedule (Schedule) that Wilson had made the number of security inspections (Calls) that it had contracted to make, or had represented that it would make to that Customer's premises in a particular month and which are specified in column E of the Schedule (Contracted Calls), save for any Calls that were missed due to break-ins at any other Customers' premises and other emergencies including fire, flood, accident, police or emergency service activities (Permitted Missed Calls), when in fact, during the relevant month: (a) Wilson made the number of Calls specified in the corresponding row of column F of the Schedule (Actual Calls) to the premises of the Customers specified in the corresponding row of column B of the Schedule; (b) the Actual Calls fell short of the Contracted Calls; and (c) Wilson missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls.
 Wilson, from October 2007 to September 2008, engaged in conduct in trade or commerce that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of section 52(1) of the Act by: (a) issuing monthly invoices (Invoices) to Customers: (i) on the dates listed in column I of the Schedule; (ii) for the amounts calculated by reference to the number of Contracted Calls; and (b) representing to each of the Customers that Wilson had made the Contracted Calls to that Customer's premises in a particular month, save for any Permitted Missed Calls; and (c) refraining from: (i) informing any of the Customers that it missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, when the Customers would reasonably have expected that, if Wilson had missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson would have disclosed that fact to them; and (ii) reducing the amount charged in the invoices or providing Customers with a refund, credit or rebate in relation to the missed calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; when in fact, during the relevant month: (d) Wilson missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; and (e) Wilson knew that it had an insufficient number of patrol officers to make the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers.
 ANNEXURE A Attention: [insert customer name] [insert customer address] [insert date] , 2009 Dear [insert name] , DISCLOSURE NOTICE - Federal Court Ordered Notice The Federal Court of Australia has recently made orders against Wilson Parking Australia 1992 Pty Ltd ( Wilson ) in relation to legal proceedings instituted by the Australian Competition Consumer Commission ( ACCC ).
 The Court found that, during the period October 2007 to June 2008, Wilson, in the provision of mobile security patrol services, made false and misleading representations to some customers by representing to those customers that Wilson had made the contracted number of security inspections ( Contracted Calls ) to their premises, when in fact, Wilson had not made all those Contracted Calls.
 Wilson will ensure the Compliance Policy is written in plain language and: (a) contains a statement of commitment to compliance with the TPA; (b) contains a requirement for all staff to report any compliance related issues and trade practices compliance concerns to the Compliance Officer; and (c) contains a clear statement that the Wilson will take action internally against any persons who are knowingly or recklessly concerned in a contravention of the TPA and will not indemnify them. 4 Complaints Handling System 4.1 Wilson will ensure the Compliance Program for the Business includes a complaints handling system capable of identifying, classifying, storing and where necessary, referring internal and external trade practices complaints. 4.2 Wilson will ensure that the Compliance Program includes whistleblower protection mechanisms to protect those coming forward with trade practices complaints.
 Because Patrol Services are generally performed: (a) at times outside normal business hours; (b) without necessarily leaving any independent record of performance; and (c) in the physical absence of the Customers and their employees; it may be difficult for Customers to determine whether or not patrol officers have performed any particular number of Calls during a period.
 It was a term of each Contract that: (a) in supplying the Patrol Services, Wilson would make a stated number of Calls at the Customer's premises in a specified service period (Contracted Calls); and (b) Wilson would use its best endeavours to provide the Contracted Calls, however interruptions or delays (or both) caused by break ins at any other Customers' premises and other emergencies including fire, flood, accident, police or emergency service activities may prevent all of the Contracted Calls being carried out during each service period (Permitted Missed Calls).
 From October 2007 to September 2008, Wilson refrained from: (a) informing any of the Customers of the number of Missed Calls; (b) informing any of the Customers that it Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; (c) reducing the amount charged in the Invoices to less than the amount chargeable for the Contracted Calls; and (d) providing the Customers with a refund, credit or rebate in relation to any Missed Calls; when the Customers would reasonably have expected that, if Wilson had Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson would have disclosed that fact to them.
 Wilson has raised and paid credits for all Missed Calls to Customers, whether or not they are Permitted Missed Calls, as follows: (a) in September 2008, Wilson processed $84,104 worth of credits for the period October 2007 --- January 2008; (b) in September 2009, Wilson processed $146,214.89 worth of credits for the period February 2008 --- July 2008; (c) from August 2008, Wilson has issued a manual adjustment note after each monthly invoice, crediting Customers for any Missed Calls during the month covered by that invoice.
 If the representation is not correct then it is false even if it is not false to the knowledge of the person making the representation: see Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 29 FLR 212 , per Franki J at 217; Darwin Bakery Pty Ltd v Sully [1981] FCA 115 ; (1981) 51 FLR 90.
 The ACCC advised the Court that it does not seek refunds or compensation orders under s 87 because: The ACCC suggests the Court may not make an order under s 83 of the Act, because this matter is proceeding on the basis of admissions rather than a contested trial and refer in this regard to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 559 ; (2002) 190 ALR 169 at 183 -184, per Finkelstein J.
 To the extent that it is suggested that the Court should not make declarations in such circumstances, where public rights are an issue, unless there is "evidence" before the Court, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Court to make the declarations sought on the basis of the information currently before the Court, including the statement of agreed facts signed by the parties.
 The public interest may warrant the making of an injunction notwithstanding the contravener is not likely to repeat that conduct: see Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd [1984] FCA 363 ; (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 300, per Toohey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41 --- 811 at [32].
