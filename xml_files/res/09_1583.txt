 Thus, I am satisfied that the $25,000 represented a payment of security for EMAS' potential entitlement to an order for its taxable costs of the arrest and release quite apart from whatever amounts EMAS had had to pay to the Marshal in respect of his costs and expenses.
 I have not been referred to any case that has considered how to apply a double payment in full to the Marshal of his demands for actual costs and expenses by each of the parties in compliance with their undertakings under rr 41 and 53.
 Nor, does it sit easily with the ordinary and natural meaning of s 34(1)(a)(ii) that limits the right of, among others, a relevant person in APC's position to recover damages from a plaintiff in EMAS' position for wrongful arrest.
