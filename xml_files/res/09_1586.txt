 The competing submissions of the eminent senior counsel who appeared before me, as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements highlights the difficulties involved for corporations generally and for FMG in particular in such circumstances.
 I conclude that FMG's use of the parallel development strategy involving Worley and potential subcontractors was not inconsistent with FMG's and Forrest's understanding that the CREC Framework Agreement was a binding contract for CREC to build and transfer the railway.
