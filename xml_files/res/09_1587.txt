 This matter arises from strike action taken by employees of several contractors on 5, 6, 8, 24 and 25 June 2009 at a high rise building site at 915 Hay Street, Perth (Site) which is controlled by Diploma Constructions (WA) Pty Ltd (Diploma).
 In its substantive application filed in June 2009, the applicant (the ABCC) seeks relief in respect of alleged breaches by the respondents of s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (BCII Act ), a civil penalty provision, which prohibits a person engaging in unlawful industrial action.
 The respondents submit that the relevant subject matter, in respect of which relief ought appropriately be granted, concerns only the actions of the respondents in relation to the 'Diploma Workers' as defined in the Application, who were required to perform building work at the Site.
 Further, the respondents submit that the only evidence concerning other Diploma sites adduced by the ABCC at the hearings on 17 and 20 July 2009 was from Mr Paul Day, project manager of the construction project at 915 Hay Street, Perth.
