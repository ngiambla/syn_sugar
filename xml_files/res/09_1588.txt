 If the IOR Board decides not to proceed with the listing of IOR prior to the current scheduled date for the Scheme Meeting then the IOR Board will consult with Aevum in relation to what implications this will have for the Scheme, including whether the Scheme Meeting should be adjourned to a later date.
 Performance risk Clauses 4.2 and 5.1 of the Scheme together provide that the consideration that shareholders in IOR are to receive for the transfer of their shares to Aevum, that is the issue of Aevum shares, will be received by them before the transfer of the IOR shares takes place.
 Mr Standen testified that apart from acting on the demutualisation of IOR, in the period from 2007 to June 2009 he had acted only for a subsidiary of IOR in the acquisition of a retirement village in Queensland.
 The evidence also establishes that Ms Campbell has consented to chair the meeting of shareholders and failing her being able to do so the meeting will be chaired by Christopher Leslie Henderson, director and company secretary of IOR.
