 I had intended that during the directions hearing I would record the fact that I do hold a relatively small number of shares in the CBA as well as having a number of accounts with the CBA.
 In particular, I noted that in the notice stating the grounds of opposition to the application dated 4 June 2009 and filed by Mr Slaveski, he alleges that the applicant, Rotstein Associates Pty Ltd, is in conspiracy with the CBA to send him bankrupt so that he is unable to sue the CBA.
 I have had regard, in particular, to whether there is any realistic possibility that the outcome of this litigation could affect the value of my shareholding in the CBA.
 In the circumstances, it could not be said that a fair-minded lay observer may reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the application before me.
