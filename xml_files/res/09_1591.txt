 That transfer appears to have been executed by Mrs Wayman as the sole director of Alhumbra Holdings Pty Limited and by the seventh defendant, Adrian Brennock, as the sole director of Queensland Resource Investments Pty Limited.
 By it, he purported to inform the Australian Securities Investments Commission that Mr Wayman had been removed as secretary of the first defendant on 8 December 2009, that Mr Whitton had been removed as a director on 8 December 2009 and that he had been appointed as a director on a date which appears to be 6 December 2009, but may be 8 December 2009.
 The document lodged with the Australian Securities Investments Commission on 8 December 2009 also purported to record the changes in the membership of the first defendant, which were said to have occurred on 30 March 2009, whereby Yohme Group Pty Limited and Alhumbra Holdings Pty Limited ceased to be shareholders and Robsan Investment Holdings Pty Limited and Queensland Resource Investments Pty Limited were said to become shareholders.
 As indicated above, the Australian Securities Investments Commission Historical Company Extract of 9 December 2009 revealed that the first plaintiff was a 'former member' of the first defendant, although it does not appear to have been a party to any transfer of shares to the persons now said to be members of the first defendant.
