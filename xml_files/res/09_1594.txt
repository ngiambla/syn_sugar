 Although the supply of commercial residential premises was taken outside the scope of residential premises, for input tax treatment under s 40-35(1)(a), the supply of commercial accommodation was treated as input taxed and thus not a taxable supply.
 Under s 40-35(1)(b), a supply "of premises" by lease, hire or licence was input taxed if the supply was of "commercial accommodation" and Division 87 would apply to the supply but for a choice by the supplier under s 87-25 of the GST Act.
 The amendment to s 40-35(1)(a) removes from the input tax treatment of a supply of residential premises, a supply of commercial residential premises or a supply of accommodation in commercial residential premises to a natural person by the owner or controller of the commercial residential premises (relevantly here, the marina).
 The integers of a supply within s 40-35(1A) are a supply of a berth which is occupied (or to be occupied) by a ship used as a residence, consisting of a supply of commercial accommodation attracting the application of Division 87.
