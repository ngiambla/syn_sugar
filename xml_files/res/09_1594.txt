 Although the supply of commercial residential premises was taken outside the scope of residential premises, for input tax treatment under s 40-35(1)(a), the supply of commercial accommodation was treated as input taxed and thus not a taxable supply.
 Under s 40-35(1)(b), a supply "of premises" by lease, hire or licence was input taxed if the supply was of "commercial accommodation" and Division 87 would apply to the supply but for a choice by the supplier under s 87-25 of the GST Act.
