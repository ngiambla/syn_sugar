 I am satisfied that all GRD Shareholders received sufficient notification of this Court hearing and were adequately informed of their right to be heard at, and to oppose the application for approval of, the Scheme.
 In the absence of the Proposal and given the continuation of current market conditions, GRD faces significant refinancing risk over the next 12 months and is likely to need to raise equity; if the Proposal is approved, shareholders will receive 55 cents cash.
 GRD shares have not traded above 55 cents since October 2008 despite improving equity markets and the Proposal; and if the Proposal is rejected, under current market conditions GRD shares are likely to trade below 55 cents for the foreseeable future, particularly in view of the risk associated with the Lancashire Waste Project and the refinancing risk facing GRD.
