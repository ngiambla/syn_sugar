 Later on the same day, on 20 August 2008, Mr Zentai made an application to the Court under ss 21(2)(b) and 21 (2)(b)(i) of the Extradition Act for an order to quash the order of Magistrate Lane made on 20 August 2008, by which Mr Zentai was found eligible for surrender for extradition to the Republic of Hungary.
 The two grounds of challenge which go to the heart of the issue as to whether he is an extraditable person are, first, that Mr Zentai is not 'accused' of an extradition offence as the extradition is sought only for the purpose of preliminary investigation.
 For Mr Zentai it is argued that some of the provisions are fundamental in the sense that they preclude entirely, as a matter of law, the Minister exercising his jurisdiction under ss 22 and 23 of the Extradition Act .
