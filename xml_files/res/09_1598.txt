 By the Insurance Scheme, the direct insurance business of Westport's Australian branch was to be transferred to the Australian branch of Swiss Re International SE (I will refer to the company as SRI and to its Australian branch as SRIAU).
 If subsection (1A) requires the Court to have regard to the interests of policyholders world wide, it may be necessary on applications for confirmation of a scheme to have actuarial evidence relating to the interests of the policyholders of overseas branches and of the legislative or regulatory requirements (or both) applicable in each overseas jurisdiction in which the body corporate operates.
 The interests of the holders of policies issued in the course of that part of the business of a foreign general insurer, such as Westport, SRI and SRC, that is carried on outside Australia are based on liabilities of the foreign general insurer arising under contracts of insurance made outside Australia.
