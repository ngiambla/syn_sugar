 I am satisfied that the Scheme Booklet which comprises the Explanatory Statement appears to comply with the provisions of the Act in the sense of giving the necessary information such that a member could make an informed decision whether or not to approve the Scheme.
 It is also confirmed that if orders are made today that a meeting of creditors will be held to approve the Scheme, the Scheme Booklet will be registered with ASIC and sent together with the Notice of Meeting and form of proxy to all Vulcan members.
