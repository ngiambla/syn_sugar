 As observed in Re Hostworks Group Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 137 at [26]; it may extend to any subject matter which is something a company is able to agree with its members, and is likened to a contract between a company and its members.
 I am satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the materials and ASIC has indicated that it does not oppose the making of the orders which are sought nor does it wish to be heard in relation to the Scheme.
 I am satisfied that the Scheme Booklet which comprises the Explanatory Statement appears to comply with the provisions of the Act in the sense of giving the necessary information such that a member could make an informed decision whether or not to approve the Scheme.
 It is also confirmed that if orders are made today that a meeting of creditors will be held to approve the Scheme, the Scheme Booklet will be registered with ASIC and sent together with the Notice of Meeting and form of proxy to all Vulcan members.
