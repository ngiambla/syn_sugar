 The affidavit of Gary Rose is quite short and simply says that he is making his best endeavours: ...to seek and obtain finance with my own property and I state that I intend to gift my mother Victoria Walters the sum of $500,000 to assist them in paying their current ATO Bill.
 I pointed out on the last occasion the matter was before the court that it would be very important for Mr Walters, the director of the company, to appear and seek leave to appear on behalf of the company or, alternatively, to appear by lawyers.
 The letter seeks to identify the steps that the accountants are required to undertake and the difficulties of undertaking those steps within the immediate period due to the forthcoming Christmas break and other circumstances.
 The effect, of course, of the failure of the company to comply with a statutory demand made upon it for payment of the amount recited in the demand notice is that a presumption of insolvency arises.
