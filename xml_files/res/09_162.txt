 The applicant failed to appear when the matter came before the FMCA on 7 October 2008 and the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application due to the non-appearance of the applicant.
 On 9 October 2008 the applicant sought to have the orders made on 7 October 2008 set aside but on 13 October 2008 the FMCA found there was no arguable case to justify setting aside the earlier orders and dismissed the application with costs.
 Since an applicant for extension of time within which to appeal as of right must show 'special reasons' (O 52 r 15(2)), nothing less should be required of an applicant for an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal ( Deighton v Telstra Corporation Ltd , above). (Emphasis added. ) [For leave to appeal from a judgment of another court O 52 r 5 fixes 21 days rather than 7].
