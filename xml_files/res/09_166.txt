 This was the view expressed by Ryan J in Moran v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 242 ; (2006) 151 FCR 1 at [30] and I see no reason not to follow his Honour.
 The Immigration records in respect of Sophie Toia demonstrate that, upon her arrival in Australia in September 1979, she told Immigration authorities that she intended to migrate to Australia and intended to live with relatives in Brisbane.
 The Immigration records in September 1979 in respect of John Toia establish that he also told Australian Immigration authorities that he was migrating to Australia, had been employed as a driver/sprayman , intended to work in Australia and intended to live in Queensland (although, as I have already mentioned, not at the same address as Sophie Toia).
