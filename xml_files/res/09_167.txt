 There is nothing in the material before the Court to establish that the Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Tribunal complied with its statutory obligations, specifically its obligation to invite the appellant to a hearing and to meet its obligations under s 425 to put dispositive issues to the appellant.
 However, if the Tribunal does give clear particulars of the information and seek comments or a response from an applicant under s 424AA, it is not required to give the particulars under s 424A: SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739.
 Such an inference is supported by the collective use of the term 'information' in s 424A(2A) of the Act (which applies to both ss 424A and 424AA), as such use implies uniformity of meaning.
