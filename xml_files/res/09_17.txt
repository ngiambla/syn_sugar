 An order pursuant to section 80(2) of the TPA restraining Allphones, by itself, its servants or agents, until further order, from determining the level of supply and/or allocation of stock to franchisees on the basis of whether the franchisee has or has not entered into or whether or not the franchisee proposes to enter into a New Franchise Agreement and/or a Deed of Release. 11.
 Nor is it surprising that, by the time the meeting was held, Allphones had devised a plan to migrate existing franchisees from the old franchise agreement to the new franchise agreement in order to circumvent the impact of his Honour's judgment and to ameliorate the effect of that judgment on Allphones.
 The planned mediation was to occur between 24 and 30 November 2008. 70 Having set up the dispute resolution process and procured the involvement of most of its existing franchisees on the old franchise agreement, Mr Baker sent an email on 20 October 2008 to all of the relevant franchisees.
 He did speak to other franchisees, including Mr Ainley and Mr Randall, and told them the substance of Mr Burnett's conversation with Ms Horth. (i) On 29 October Mr Ainley, who is a director of the Allphones franchise store at Mirrabooka (WA) telephoned Ms Horth and spoke with her.
