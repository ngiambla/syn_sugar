 It was not suggested on behalf of the applicant, and it would not be open on the evidence to hold, that the purpose of the respondent's examination of the applicant was to have him disclose his intended defence in the forthcoming criminal proceeding.
 Indeed, there was no suggestion that, before the applicant took the objection which he did, either the respondent or counsel assisting had any idea that the answer to the question posed by the latter would reveal an element in the applicant's intended defence to the criminal charges.
 The respondent resisted the suggestion that, as a matter of fact, his requirement of the applicant to answer the question posed on 12 February 2009 would give rise to a real risk of an interference with the administration of justice.
 The respondent said that he did not intend to authorise anyone who had an involvement in that investigation or prosecution to be present during any examination of the applicant, or to have access to any evidence obtained during any such examination.
