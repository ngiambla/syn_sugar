 The nature and history of the proceeding The issues in this appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") concern the Tribunal's application of s 24 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ("the VE Act").
 In any event, the Tribunal found that the applicant did not meet the "alone" test in s 24(1)(c) of the VE Act during the relevant assessment period, a finding that was fatal to the applicant's case, whatever was the date on which he was found to have ceased work.
