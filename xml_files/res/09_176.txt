 This means his widow's claim must fail. ' The Tribunal did include in its reasons for decision a number of findings on questions of fact which it judged to be material together with references to 'the evidence or other material' on which those findings were based.
 Insofar as s 43(2B) of the AAT Act requires the Tribunal to include in its reasons for decision references to 'the evidence or other material' on which findings of fact, adjudged by it to be material, were based, it seems to me that the expression 'other material' was intended to contemplate matters such as an agreement as to relevant facts, other material to which the Tribunal may have had regard which did not constitute 'evidence' and material such as policy statements.
 When originally enacted (see Act No. 91 of 1975), s 43(2) of the AAT Act provided as follows: '43(2) The Tribunal shall give reasons in writing for its decision and those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact. ' By the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Act 1977 (Cth) (Act No. 58 of 1977) the AAT Act was amended, s 43(2) was omitted and a new subsection (2) substituted which relevantly provided: '43(2) ... the Tribunal shall give reasons in writing for its decision and those reasons shall include its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based. ' Section 43(2B) was inserted into the AAT Act by s 33 of the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 1) Act 1982 (Cth) (Act No. 26 of 1982).
 If it does not then give written reasons, it must do so if requested to do so by a party to the proceedings. ...' Section 430(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which deals with decisions on review by the Refugee Review Tribunal, is substantially similar to s 43(2) and (2B) of the AAT Act.
