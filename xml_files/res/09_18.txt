 However, those parts of this native title application and one other Quall native title application (NTD6026 of 1998) relating to areas of land in Area B were not dismissed. 3 The Northern Territory was the main respondent to the 19 native title applications in Risk and remains so in relation to this native title application.
 That the Aboriginal society at sovereignty, that by the traditional laws and customs, of its normative system, possessed rights and interests in relation to the lands and waters in the Darwin area, inclusive of Area A, was some Aboriginal society other than the society of the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin peoples identified by Mansfield J in Risk ; and 2.
 Furthermore, the aspect upon which this native title application failed in the consolidated proceedings in Risk , ie a substantial interruption in the continuous acknowledgement and observance of the laws and customs of the Larrakia peoples since sovereignty, was a joint failure with the Risk and Quall applicants (see [80] and [88] above).
 Finally, Mr Quall himself changed from the Danggalaba clan case to the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, in October 2001, and then changed back to the Danggalaba clan case, during final submissions in Risk in 2004, after four witnesses he called in support of the Larrakia/Kulumbiringin case, failed to give evidence in support of that case (see [38] above).
