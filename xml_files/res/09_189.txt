 The learned Federal Magistrate was also submitted erroneously to have concluded that, because the question of whether the originally specified main businesses were qualifying businesses had not been raised before the Tribunal, it could not be raised as a jurisdictional error ground before the Federal Magistrates Court.
 It was further part of the Appellant's submission that the words "of that kind" in cl 845.213 (b) indicated that the "main business" at the time of decision need not be one and the same as that at the time of application.
 The requirement for a duality of satisfaction by a visa applicant of particular criteria at both the time of application and the time of decision is not unique to cl 845, nor even to those considered in Xiang's Case and Rao's Case.
 It is a further permeating feature that the verb "continues" is employed so as to require satisfaction on the part of the administrative decision maker at the time of decision that a visa applicant "continues to" satisfy nominated criteria which were first required to be satisfied at the time of application.
