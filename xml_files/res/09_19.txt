 His Honour said at [39] that: The practical judicial approach has been...to identify any features of the settlement that are obviously unreasonable or unfair...[and] where some group members object to a settlement and state their reasons..., their reasons will provide a convenient focus by reference to which the court will decide matters of fairness and reasonableness.
 I will, however, comment on several key aspects of the Scheme and explain why I am satisfied that they are fair, reasonable and adequate. 22 Clause 3 of the Scheme provides that in acting as administrator Maurice Blackburn has an obligation to do so on behalf of group members as a whole, and may not act as lawyer for individual group members in relation to their particular claims.
 Maurice Blackburn has also undertaken not to seek to recover either from the settlement sum or from individual group members any costs they incur in acting for individual group members or in discharging their function as administrator (those costs are discussed in more detail at [30] et seq below).
