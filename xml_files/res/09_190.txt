 The administrators depose (Mr Bettles deposes on behalf of the administrators) that it remains in the best interests of the creditors of the company that the matter be adjourned for a period of 14 days to enable the refinance proposal with the banks to be completed.
 That there exists power to further extend the convening period is, in my opinion and clear: see Re Henry Walker Eltin Group Limited (Administrators Appointed) [2005] FCA 984.
 There is also, in my opinion, clear authority further to adjourn the winding up application: see Creevey v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 19 ACSR 456 , and; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v First Netcom Pty Ltd (2001) 19 ACLC 324.
