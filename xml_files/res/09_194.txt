 Mr Peterson asked Elias Spernovasilis and Mr Reardon, both Vice Presidents of the CFMEU, whether the CFMEU was going to clear the vehicles away from the gates that day.
 The second charge alleges that the CFMEU has contravened the first order made by his Honour by interfering with the passage of persons into and from the site on the 3 days immediately after the order was made.
 That order required the CFMEU forthwith to remove any vehicles that were within its control (including vehicles bearing particular registration numbers) if those vehicles were interfering with or impeding access to the site.
