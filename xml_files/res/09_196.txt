 On 2 February 2009 I handed down my reasons for judgment in this proceeding and ordered that the application filed by the plaintiff be dismissed and that the issue of the defendant's costs of the application, and whether those costs be paid by the plaintiff on an indemnity basis, be reserved for further consideration.
 On 1 August 2008 the defendant's solicitors sent a letter to the plaintiff's solicitors headed "Without Prejudice Save as to Costs" in which the defendant: (a) contended that there was no basis for the Court to make the orders sought and set out reasons for that contention; (b) made an offer that the proceeding be terminated on the basis that the plaintiff discontinue the proceeding and that each party bear its own costs to date.
 Although the defendant has not succeeded in its submission that it be awarded indemnity costs in the circumstances which existed on the day I handed down my reasons, I do not consider that it is appropriate to penalise the defendant by ordering it to pay the plaintiff's costs of the application for indemnity costs.
