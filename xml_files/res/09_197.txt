 Nor was it disputed that, if Mr Yat Tan had been properly appointed and was still acting as the appellant's authorised recipient under s 494D of the Act, the decision was deemed to have been duly received on that day by Mr Tan on behalf of the appellant pursuant to s 494D(2) (see also s 494B(5) , and SZFOH v Minister for Immigration Citizenship (2007) 159 FCR 199 , and Lee v Minister for Immigration Citizenship (2007) 159 FCR 181).
 Having regard to the appellant's evidence to the Court, his Honour found that it was not a matter of particular concern to the appellant to know which of the persons he dealt with, or indeed, which other person within the firm of Tan Tan, held registration as the migration agent responsible under the Act for the provision of the immigration services given to the appellant: [20].
 Having regard to the skimpy evidence before him as to the internal management of migration matters within Tan Tan, his Honour said that this would not cause him to find that appropriate supervision and responsibility was absent on the part of Mr Yat Tan in relation to the performance of the work for which the appellant engaged Tan Tan: [29].
 Ground 5 contended: The Tribunal's decision was affected by fraud on the Tribunal, on DIAC and the applicant because Yat Tan was not the migration agent acting for the client and as such in reality was not the authorised recipient but Tat [sic] Tan and Yat Tan still gave the deceptive and fraudulent impression to DIAC that he was the migration agent for the applicant.
 His Honour observed that the authorities subsequent to SZFDE v Minister for Immigration Citizenship [2007] HCA 35 ; (2007) 232 CLR 189 , for example, Minister for Immigration Citizenship v SZLIX (2008) 245 ALR 501, SZLHP v Minister for Immigration Citizenship (2008) 172 FCR 170 and SZHVM v Minister for Immigration Citizenship (2008) 170 FCR 211, emphasised the need for a careful formulation of allegations of fraud coming within the principles referred to by the High Court, as well as careful attention to the necessary causal relationships between the suggested fraud and the suggested inconsistency with statutory procedures.
 His Honour understood the broad contention to be that there were knowingly false communications by unspecified partners or employees to the appellant and/or the Department of Immigration, which incorrectly suggested that his visa application was being presented and pursued by a person at Tan Tan who was a registered migration agent, when in fact that was not the case.
 Essentially, it failed upon his Honour's findings of fact that he was not satisfied that Mr Yat Tan was not the partner at Tan Tan who undertook all the responsibilities, for the purposes of the Act, for the immigration assistance given to the appellant by the partners and employees of that firm.
 On the evidence before him, there was a substantial dispute between the appellant and Tan Tan whether, in fact, the appellant actually received from them the delegate's decision on the day it was delivered, and well within the time for appealing which was clearly stated in the delegate's notification.
 If he was sent it as claimed by Tan Tan, then any preceding fraudulent conduct in relation to the registration under the Act of any person or persons at Tan Tan was immaterial to the applicant losing his right of appeal.
 His Honour's short opinion was that he was not satisfied on the evidence before him that Tan Tan did fail to communicate the delegate's decision speedily, and in the manner that they claim in their correspondence with the appellant.
 His Honour also found that it was not a matter of concern for the appellant to know which person within the firm he dealt with or who within the firm was registered as a migration agent: [19] and [20] of his reasons.
