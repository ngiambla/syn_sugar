 Further, considering all the evidence, his Honour was not prepared to find that, in fact, Mr Yat Tan was in any way derelict in his responsibilities as a registered migration agent under the relevant provisions of the Act, in particular s 280(1): [28].
 If he was sent it as claimed by Tan Tan, then any preceding fraudulent conduct in relation to the registration under the Act of any person or persons at Tan Tan was immaterial to the applicant losing his right of appeal.
 His Honour's short opinion was that he was not satisfied on the evidence before him that Tan Tan did fail to communicate the delegate's decision speedily, and in the manner that they claim in their correspondence with the appellant.
 His Honour also found that it was not a matter of concern for the appellant to know which person within the firm he dealt with or who within the firm was registered as a migration agent: [19] and [20] of his reasons.
