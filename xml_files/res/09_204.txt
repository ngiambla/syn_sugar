 The second, from Mrs Murray, said that she believed Mr McKell had not been able to uplift documents to prepare the appeal books and that she had not been able to purchase a copy of the transcript as she could not ascertain the cost and needed time to obtain funding.
 Given the lack of information in these affidavits and the fact that Mr and Mrs Murray were not present in Court (and apparently reside in Tamworth), I requested that Mr McKell attend Court.
 Counsel for Mr Duddy also sought orders for costs of the notice of motion and the appeal on an indemnity basis with an order that those costs be paid out of the estate of Mr and Mrs Murray.
