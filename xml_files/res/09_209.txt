 The uncle said that he knew the appellant and Ms L very well and that he knew the appellant loved Ms L and was fully committed to living a life together with her and their daughter.
 The tribunal concluded that this fact suggested that the appellant's desire to remain in Australia was stronger than his desire to live with Ms L and their child and brought into question his commitment to a familial or de facto relationship.
 The appellant argued, with some force, that there was an unfairness in asking an applicant for a protection visa why he or she has not followed to a third country the persons they claimed to love.
 The tribunal found that were he returned to Bangladesh, and unable to live in a familial relationship with Ms L and their child, his circumstances would not be substantially different to his present circumstances --- of separation from them - that he had endured in Australia since 2000.
