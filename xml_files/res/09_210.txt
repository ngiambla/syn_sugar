 The applicant's willingness to return to Pakistan and to remain in Pakistan, albeit for only a few weeks, despite his alleged homosexual conduct, causes the Tribunal to question the applicant's claim that he engaged in homosexual acts in the UAE or that he was genuinely fearful of persecution in Pakistan.
 The Tribunal finds that the applicant's conduct in returning to Pakistan and in failing to seek protection is inconsistent with the claimed fear of persecution arising as a result of his homosexuality.
 The appellant in SZLGP claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution from the authorities for hiding and assisting two distant relatives who were wanted by the police as leaders of an anti-government protest in relation to confiscated farmland.
 In those supplementary written submissions, counsel for the applicant contended that the Tribunal enlivened s 424AA of the Act by giving orally to the applicant particulars of information that the Tribunal would consider to be a reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.
