 The respondents adduced evidence that in October 2007 Gemhall Holdings had lent $310,000 to the respondent, Time 2000 Systems (Australia) Pty Limited (Time 2000 Systems) in a number of separate loans and that the payment of $250,000 on 31 December 2007 was a partial repayment of those loans.
 It would seem to be undisputed that, as at the date of the hearing before Besanko J, if those loans had been made by Gemhall Holdings and Time 2000 the sum of $120,000 remained outstanding to those two entities.
