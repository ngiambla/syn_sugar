 His Honour refused an application for an extension of time to apply pursuant to s 75(v) of the Constitution for an order to show cause why a decision of a delegate of the Chief of Army made on 3 November 2004 should not be quashed and, for consequential orders.
 It was necessary for the extension of time to be granted because r 25.06.1 of the High Court Rules required the application to have been made less than six months after the making of the termination order.
 That case involved an application for an extension of time to commence an action for damages in tort and for compensation for breach of fiduciary duty in relation to a series of sexual assaults upon that appellant against his guardian.
