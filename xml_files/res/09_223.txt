 Counsel for the respondents put it to Mr Leonard that Mr Mates had said that he would ask for a labourer for the site, and Mr Leonard responded that Mr Mates "may have" said that.
 According to Mr Chambers, Mr Mates repeated the request for Kane to provide a labourer on the project to act as a general labourer, an occupational health and safety representative and a first aider.
 The stoppage of work by the workers on the site constituted the engagement, by them, in a ban, limitation or restriction upon the performance of work, and Mr Mates organised or procured that stoppage.
