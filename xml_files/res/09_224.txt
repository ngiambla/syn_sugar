 By notice of motion filed on 18 February 2009 the sixth and seventh respondents (the national body and New South Wales branch of the Australian Workers' Union, referred to below as the AWU) seek orders varying and, in part, setting aside the orders I made on 17 October 2008 and the reasons for decision published on the same date ( Alfred v Wakelin (No 2) [2008] FCA 1543).
 Further, that Mr Tocchet's evidence about Mr O'Connor being present at, but quiet during, the meeting on 10 November 2005 would be preferred to that of Mr Smits and Mr Rosenblatt. (6) On the basis of the pleadings, evidence and submissions I identified the three issues in the case (at [5]) as: First, what action did Mr O'Connor take with respect to the industrial action?
 Further, it was remarkable that the AWU had not sought leave to withdraw its admissions and had not called any evidence from Mr Tocchet or Mr O'Connor in support of the motion or, indeed, any evidence explaining why the so-called "true facts" were not ascertained before the hearing.
 The AWU's motion and submissions assumed that the "Pre-Start Form" for 10 November 2005 conclusively established that Mr O'Connor was not at the mine (and thus not present during the meeting) on 10 November 2005.
