 The applicant submits that this taxation treatment applies on a continuing basis and, in support of that submission, points to s 22(2)(a) which states that the Parliamentary intention expressed therein applies "on and after the succession day".
 So much may be accepted, however, it is not necessary to conclude that s 22(3) provides for a continuing partnership between a notional Savings Bank and the Commonwealth Bank, or a continuing partnership between the Commonwealth Bank and itself, in order to find a purpose for the continuing operation of the Parliamentary intention.
 Where partnerships between the transferring bank and third parties are concerned Part 3 effects the transfer of assets and liabilities so that the receiving bank becomes the successor to the transferring bank in those partnerships.
 As the respondent's submissions point out, "it is only by working out the tax effect of [the Savings Bank] continuing in existence that it is possible to know what the tax effect of not integrating would have been".
