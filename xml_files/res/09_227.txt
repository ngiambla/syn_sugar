 There are some differences in this application but those differences essentially are, as I perceive it, differences arising by reason of the proper legal characterisation of the relationships and circumstances arising on the evidence.
 They involve characterising the legal effect of standard arrangements entered into between Opes Prime (stockbrokers) and its customers (who include the applicants) and alleged liability of ANZ arising out of those arrangements.
 The real question is where the case can be conducted or continued most suitably bearing in mind the interests of all parties, the ends of justice in the determination of the issues between them and the most efficient administration of the Court.
