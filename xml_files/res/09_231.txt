 His Honour concluded at [34]: In my view, the substance of the employee entitlement claim, the central and critical aspects of it, and its subject matter, relate to payments by the employers, as such, for the benefit of the employees, as such.
 The payments relate to particular aspects of the remuneration to be received by employees for service to their employer (that is, employee entitlements in respect of severance pay and leave) and belong to and are within the sphere of the relationship between Electrolux and its employees, as such.
 The union's reliance on the High Court in the Superannuation Case at 356 where it said ' the obligation of the employer to make payments ends with the relationship between him and his employee ' is insufficient to establish that nexus.
