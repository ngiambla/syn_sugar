 The Federal Magistrate concluded that the applicant's submission was to particularise and expand on information which the Tribunal had paraphrased or summarised in what it put to the applicant.
 However, since the enactment of s 424AA and s 424A(2A), the Tribunal does not have to comply with s 424A(1) if the Tribunal proceeds in accordance with s 424A(2A).
 Section 424A(2A) is engaged "if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, under s 424AA".
 There would be no point in the Tribunal resorting to s 424AA(a) if the Tribunal had already given the information to the applicant in accordance with s 424A(1) and by the processes in s 424A(2).
