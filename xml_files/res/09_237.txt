 Alternatively to paragraph 1(b) above, that: (a) the claim for relief in paragraph 2 of the Application be struck out; and (b) the Applicant have leave to file and serve by 10 April 2009 an Amended Application including a claim for a mandatory injunction, such leave being conditional upon the Amended Application including, or incorporating by reference, a statement of the design of the fish transfer device which, by the grant of the injunction, the Respondent would be compelled to install and operate. 3.
 Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the statement of claim make the following allegations: The respondent has engaged, engages and, unless restrained by the Court, proposes to engage in conduct consisting of an act or omission that constitutes an offence or other contravention of the EPBC Act by failing since the dam became operational to install and operate a fish transfer device suitable for lungfish in contravention of condition 3 of the approval for the dam.
 Particulars of conduct constituting an offence or other contravention The respondent has installed and operated, is operating, and intends to continue to operate the upstream fishway and downstream fishway in a manner whereby: (a) The entrances to the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are not likely to be found by lungfish attempting to move or migrate upstream or downstream of the dam wall. (b) The entrances to the upstream fishway and downstream fishway are too small for fully grown lungfish to enter. (c) The caged container in the upstream fishway is too small for fully grown lungfish. (d) The upstream fishway and downstream fishway do not operate continuously. (e) The downstream fishway is not suitable for lungfish to move or migrate downstream of the dam when water levels in the dam are beneath EL 62.0 m (57% of the full storage capacity of the dam) because the inlet to the downstream fishway is constructed above this height. (f) Lungfish are likely to be injured by the speed at which they are transported through the downstream fishway and the small dimensions of the pipes and downstream release pool. (g) Lungfish, particularly juveniles, are susceptible to predation while moving through the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway. (h) Lungfish exiting the upstream fishway or the downstream fishway are susceptible to predation at the release point. (i) Due to the matters raised in paragraphs 6(a)-(h), the upstream fishway and the downstream fishway are not likely (more than 50% probable) to allow any normal sized lungfish to move upstream and downstream of the dam without injury irrespective of the water level in the dam.
