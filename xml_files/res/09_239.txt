 The contention of the applicant is that, notwithstanding the fact that he was present during the entire hearing which took place on that day and was given every opportunity to present his case, he left the courtroom before his Honour delivered his reasons for judgment but after argument had concluded.
 The applicant submitted that, when a Registrar of this Court declined to accept his Notice of Motion lodged with the Registry of the Court on 17 December 2008, that Registrar was impermissibly purporting to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth and did so by relying upon Or 46 r 7A.
 In those submissions, the applicant advanced an additional contention that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal " have no authority for judicial reviews " and thus that he had a right to bring and have determined the application which Cowdroy J had dismissed.
