 The 2001 Tribunal set aside the decision of Australia Post not to pay compensation for injuries to Ms Cheung's shoulders and neck and an earlier decision of 8 July 1999 that Australia Post was no longer liable to pay compensation for ' lateral epicondylitis right elbow '.
 The 2001 Tribunal also varied Australia Post's decision of 6 March 2001 by adding that Australia Post was liable to pay compensation for ' chronic pain syndrome in both upper limbs and neck '.
 It was open to the 2008 Tribunal to apply the previous decision to some or all of its findings and, Ms Cheung submits, the 2008 Tribunal was obliged to consider whether or not to do so.
