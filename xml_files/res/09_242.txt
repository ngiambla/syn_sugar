 These proceedings involve claims for loss and damage for an admitted breach of a Howards Storage World franchise agreement and alleged misrepresentations about two aspects of the operation of the franchise.
 In other words, that the grant of the "exclusive franchise territory" to Haviv in cl 1C meant not only that another HSW store could not be located within the territory but also that franchise territories could not overlap.
 Haviv and Mr Aghion alleged that the representations were that no other HSW franchise premises would be located within the territory and that the territory would not overlap with any other franchise territory.
 The conduct on which Haviv and Mr Aghion relied discloses that HSW and Plaza represented to Haviv that it would receive an exclusive franchise territory of a 5 kilometre radius from the Burwood store pursuant to the franchise agreement.
