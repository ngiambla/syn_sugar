 By a letter dated 19 July 2007, Ms Khadpekar requested that the respondent, who is the trustee of Ms Khadpekar's bankrupt estate, appeal or assist in appealing the decision of the Cairns Magistrates Court.
 Further, at [17], the Federal Magistrate recognised that Ms Khadpekar had said that her medical condition had been "extant since about 1996", and that there was evidence before the court to that effect.
 Rather, he confined his consideration to the merits of the proposed ground of appeal based on the irregularity of the discovery order and its subsequent impact on the judgment entered against Ms Khadpekar.
