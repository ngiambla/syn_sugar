 The gravaman of the complaint by the applicants is that, in respect of the particular permits they hold, the process adopted by the Authority to reach a value (the Relative Price Factor) for those particular packages of permits was "just irrational and illogical".
 In essence, the complaint is that the methodology adopted by the AAP was very casual and imprecise, and that the method adopted concerning valuation, particularly the valuation of packages which involved fishing in Area E, was unreasonable, in the sense of capricious or irrational.
 On 12 January 2007 (which is, it has to be noted, subsequent to the determination of the Management Plan) Robert L Lamason sold to Riataworth Pty Ltd fishing permits number 402218B and C, and fishing permits 458772A and B.
