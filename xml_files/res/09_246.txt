 The Tribunal described the inconsistency between the website information concerning the formation of the Liberal Party of Bangladesh and the appellant's evidence of the transition of the Freedom Party into the Liberal Party in 1975 as a "significant inconsistency".
 The Tribunal concluded that the letter did not overcome the Tribunal's concern about the significant inconsistency between the appellant's version of the history of the Freedom Party and its relationship with the Liberal Party and the objective website information explaining the evolution and formation of the Liberal Party.
 The Tribunal noted that when pressed about these matters in giving oral evidence to the Tribunal the appellant could not recall what had happened to his father or his father's brother.
 The Tribunal noted that the appellant did not give any explanation in response to these concerns put to the appellant at p 3 of the Tribunal's letter of 22 August 2007, when responding to that letter on 1 November 2007.
