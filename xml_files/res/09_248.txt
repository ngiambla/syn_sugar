 Her Honour in that decision at [23] said that it is ordinarily the case that a basis for a claim of persecution within the meaning of the Convention will not flow from the enforcement of laws providing for compulsory military service, or for the punishment of those who avoid such service.
 The Federal Magistrate, having identified an error of law on the part of the Tribunal in misstating the law in the way described, was nevertheless not satisfied that that error of law amounted to jurisdictional error.
 His Honour noticed, correctly, that the main focus of the appellant before the Tribunal was her fear to return to Israel principally from fear for her physical safety given the terrorist threats to the country.
 The second contention is that the appellant's material exposed an unarticulated claim to fear persecution, in effect for a political opinion, by being a conscientious objector to undertaking compulsory military service if she were to return to Israel.
