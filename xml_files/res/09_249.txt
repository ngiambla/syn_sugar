 Counsel for Ms Hawkins submitted that there was nothing in relation to the documentation to support the proposition that whatever Ms Clegg was being asked to cast her eye over had anything to do with the contract dated 1 May 2008 as opposed to the draft document being used as "a template for something else".
 The issues relating to the Contract of Sale are such that the benefits and the receipt of trailing commissions to which Elite Wealth Builders claims to be entitled, and which will continue to be paid should be under the control of an independent person until the Commission concludes its investigation and its application to wind-up Elite Wealth Builders is determined.
 No documentation has been produced by Mr Weerappah or Ms Hawkins in relation to the terms of the payment of the $600,000 or the assignment of the debt or the instruction to pay the money to Elite Wealth Builders.
 The consequence is that the liquidator of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd may be able to set aside that transaction on the basis that Mr Weerappah entered into that transaction as a director of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd in breach of his duty to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and that Ms Hawkins was privy to and part of that breach of duty.
