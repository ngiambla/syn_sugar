 No documentation has been produced by Mr Weerappah or Ms Hawkins in relation to the terms of the payment of the $600,000 or the assignment of the debt or the instruction to pay the money to Elite Wealth Builders.
 The consequence is that the liquidator of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd may be able to set aside that transaction on the basis that Mr Weerappah entered into that transaction as a director of Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd in breach of his duty to Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd and that Ms Hawkins was privy to and part of that breach of duty.
