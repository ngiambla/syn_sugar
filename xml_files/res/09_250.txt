 Length of Trial Having regard to the issues in dispute as between ASIC and Sattvic, and the evidence likely to be adduced, it is the estimate of counsel for Sattvic that, if tried separately, the trial of the issues as between ASIC and Sattvic probably will take no more than a day.
 Moreover, again by reason of the limited issues as between ASIC and Sattvic, upon the giving of discovery, in respect of which there is now no dispute as between these parties, and subject to the filing of the parties evidence, the matter would be ready for trial.
 Sattvic submits that if the trial of the action as between it and ASIC is not separated from the trial of the issues as between ASIC and the other respondents, it seems likely that the matter will not be entered for trial for some considerable time.
