 The respondent, by motion dated 15 December 2008, seeks an order pursuant to s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that this proceeding be transferred to the South Australian District Registry of this Court and be conducted in Adelaide.
 In this proceeding commenced on 17 November 2008, Mr Garrett seeks to review a decision by Mr Macks, as trustee in bankruptcy, made on 17 September 2008 to refuse Mr Garrett's request to review his earlier decision to admit a number of proofs of debt in the administration of Mr Garrett's bankruptcy, which proofs were admitted by Mr Macks on 24 May 2007.
 No application was made by Mr Garrett under s 104 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ("the Act") to review the decision of Mr Macks in respect of the admission of those debts.
 However, the issues arising in this proceeding have a significant connection with South Australia as set out in the affidavit of Mr Macks sworn on 15 December 2008 in support of this application.
