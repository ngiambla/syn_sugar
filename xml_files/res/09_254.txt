 The appellants or their legal advisers are not to be criticised for taking that course, but it is plain that they now wish to depart from the approach previously taken by reconstituting the proceedings in the manner now proposed.
 I have already referred to the reasons for delay which entail commercial considerations as to what is now thought to be, on the plaintiffs' part, the reason for departing from the decision to pursue the warranty insurer.
 A great deal of preparation had been undertaken and, when the matter was before me for directions on 26 February 2009, the parties should have been ready to take a hearing date.
 I have come to the view that whilst the prejudice to which Mr Jones points is a serious one, it does not outweigh the difficulties which would flow from permitting a multiplicity of proceedings.
