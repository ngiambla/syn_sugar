 It is not deposed to by Mr Carey nor submitted by counsel for Lanepoint that Mr Carey's credibility was at issue in the prosecution which occurred nearly thirty years ago.
 The surviving matters, at their highest, are therefore: (a) I acted as counsel for the Corporate Affairs Commission about 29 years ago in a prosecution of Mr Carey for, loosely described, "insolvent trading".
 Lanepoint submits that taken in isolation this would not constitute a ground for my recusal but taken together with the other matters relied upon it created, in effect, an accumulation of reasons for my doing so.
 Mr Carey deposed not only that he recalled the matter of his prosecution and my involvement but says that it was of such concern to him that on the first day of the trial he raised it with counsel for Lanepoint.
