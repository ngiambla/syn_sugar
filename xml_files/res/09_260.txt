 The identification of the bankrupt's contingent and prospective liabilities as at 10 April 2002 and the extent to which they may be considered as part of his debts, at that time, is a crucial matter for determination.
 The respondents submit that those statutory liabilities did not exist at 10 April 2002 because the amendments to the legislation allowing the Solicitors' Trust to claim against the bankrupt were not in force at that time.
 As at April 2002, that litigation had not been settled and any foreseeable recovery through that litigation could not have been available to creditors by April, or even June, 2002.
 The purpose of the provision is to undo a transfer that was at below market value and to return to the transferee the value of what they paid for the property.
