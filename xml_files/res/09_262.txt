 For that reason, it is erroneous to take into account "those circumstances which ordinarily would fall for consideration on an application for bail where a person is charged domestically for the commission of a crime".
 In Cabal the grounds for granting bail were explained: [61] Given this background and the rationale for the "special circumstances" condition, bail in extradition cases should be granted only when two conditions are fulfilled.
 In Cabal it was said at [70] and [74]: [70] The purpose of the extradition proceedings is set at risk if an applicant is entitled to bail upon proof of special circumstances and a probability that the applicant will not abscond.
 Unless the special circumstances are so cogent and the risk so very low that the proper exercise of discretion requires the grant of bail, any real risk of flight should be decisive against the grant of bail. (Emphasis added) [74] It is no doubt true that the test is not whether the proven special circumstances are such that it is not probable that the applicant will abscond.
