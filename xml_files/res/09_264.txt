 Some time during 2008 Ms George commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland (Supreme Court proceedings 3474 of 2008) claiming that property at 130 Landing Place Moggill, the registered proprietor of which was the second respondent in these proceedings, was actually held on trust for her minor son, and that Ms George was the trustee of that trust.
 I am not prepared to make an Order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 2 of her amended Notice of Motion --- as has been observed by both Dowsett J and myself during the course of these proceedings, if there is an error in the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court it is for the Federal Court to review on appeal.
 Finally, I do not consider that it is appropriate that I make an Order in the terms sought by Ms George in para 3 of her amended Notice of Motion, being an order by which she apparently seeks recognition of her reliance on certain material and on Supreme Court Orders.
