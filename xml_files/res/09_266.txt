 Bunn has stated that he will respect the penalty that the Federal Court issues, but of course Metcash will have to deal, eventually, before the Court, with having to justify the facts of their original claims to the Federal Court so as to obtain the said interim injunction.
 There is, it should be said, a very real question, as Lander J indicated to Mr Bunn over three years ago, as to whether the terms of Order 3.5(c) are probably "too wide".
 Nonetheless, as is occasionally observed, it is "common or usual practice" to order that the contemnor pay costs on an indemnity basis: see eg Concrete Constructions Pty Ltd v Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees' Union (No 2) (1987) 15 FCR 64 at 86-87.
 I am not satisfied that, in addition to paying a fine, Mr Bunn should properly be called upon to pay the full costs of the considerable forces arrayed, and of the material presented, against him.
