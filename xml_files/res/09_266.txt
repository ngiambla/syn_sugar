 There is, it should be said, a very real question, as Lander J indicated to Mr Bunn over three years ago, as to whether the terms of Order 3.5(c) are probably "too wide".
 I am not satisfied that, in addition to paying a fine, Mr Bunn should properly be called upon to pay the full costs of the considerable forces arrayed, and of the material presented, against him.
