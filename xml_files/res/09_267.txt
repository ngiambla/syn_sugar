 Standing alone these contraventions warrant penalties as follows: - (i) ss 178(4)(a)(iia) and (iib) of the Workplace Relations Act respectively - $11,500 for the October 2005 industrial action (on the basis of a penalty of $7,500 for the first day of the contravention and $2,000 for each day thereafter) and $3,000 for the November 2005 industrial action, and (ii) s 170MN of the Workplace Relations Act - $7,500 for the October 2005 industrial action and $3,000 for the November 2005 industrial action.
 Aggregated total: - $43,000 (2) The AWU-NSW: October 2005 BCII Act (s 49(2)): - $12,500 November 2005 BCII Act (s 49(2)): - $5,500 Aggregated total: - $18,000 I must now determine whether the sum of these individual penalties is proportionate to the totality of the unions' contraventions.
 I consider that Mr O'Connor should be penalised as follows (before consideration of the totality principle): October 2005 (total: - $9,000) (a) BCII Act (s 49(2)): - $5,000; (b) Workplace Relations Act (s 178(4)(a)(iia)): - $2,500 (being $1,500 for the first day of the contravention and $500 for each day thereafter); and (c) Workplace Relations Act (s 170MN): - $1,500.
