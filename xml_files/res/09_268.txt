 Factor 5(a) refers to experiencing a psychiatric condition at the time of the clinical onset of the alcohol dependence condition. (Factor 5(c) refers to suffering a psychiatric disorder at the time of the clinical worsening of the condition. ) It has already been accepted that the applicant suffered from an anxiety condition commencing in 1970.
 However I conclude that the Tribunal did not fully understand the definition of the words "experiencing a severe stressor" as applied to the applicant's handling of the casualty lists.
 Curiously, such acceptance seems to have been based on the Saigon incident, evidence of the occurrence of which was rejected by the Tribunal in considering his alcohol dependence.
 The Tribunal said that the Board had concluded that the applicant's alcohol dependence pre-existed his anxiety condition, although Dr Majumdar suggested that the alcohol dependence had arisen out of the Saigon incident and the applicant's handling of casualties.
