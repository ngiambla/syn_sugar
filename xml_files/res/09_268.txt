 However I conclude that the Tribunal did not fully understand the definition of the words "experiencing a severe stressor" as applied to the applicant's handling of the casualty lists.
 The Tribunal said that the Board had concluded that the applicant's alcohol dependence pre-existed his anxiety condition, although Dr Majumdar suggested that the alcohol dependence had arisen out of the Saigon incident and the applicant's handling of casualties.
