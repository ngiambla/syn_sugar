 The veteran must have met a death with which that SoP is concerned in order to link such death with his war service: see Lees v Repatriation Commission [2002] FCAFC 398 ; (2002) 125 FCR 331 at [16] .
 Such misinterpretation caused the Tribunal to make an error of law by treating the veteran's kidney failure (the proximate or ultimate cause of death) as a 'kind of death' instead of having regard to the cause of that failure.
