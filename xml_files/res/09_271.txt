 The applicant submitted that the following evidence supported this submission: Evidence that trade mark 967804 was apparently used by both the respondent and The Food Channel Pty Ltd in relation to menus (which are within the specification of trade mark 967804).
 The applicant in the proceedings before me submits that the defect in the trade mark application --- namely, that The Food Channel Pty Ltd as trade mark applicant was not the owner --- was fatal to the trade mark application because only the owner of a trade mark can apply for its registration.
