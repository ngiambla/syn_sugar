 However, the applicant also contends that there is considerable confusion in relation to ownership of trade mark 967804 at the filing date, so that it may be impossible to make a positive finding in favour of either The Food Channel Pty Ltd or the respondent as to ownership.
 The applicant submitted that the following evidence supported this submission: Evidence that trade mark 967804 was apparently used by both the respondent and The Food Channel Pty Ltd in relation to menus (which are within the specification of trade mark 967804).
 Evidence that the menus exhibited by the respondent which purportedly bear trade mark 967804 have a copyright notice in the name of "The Food Channel", and that at least two menus actually refer to The Food Channel Pty Ltd (Annexures X and Y to the affidavit of Paul Lawrence sworn 31 October 2007).
 The applicant in the proceedings before me submits that the defect in the trade mark application --- namely, that The Food Channel Pty Ltd as trade mark applicant was not the owner --- was fatal to the trade mark application because only the owner of a trade mark can apply for its registration.
