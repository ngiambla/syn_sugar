 As the summary of facts demonstrates (BHPDRI at [26] to [60], BHPTM at [61] to [87], Finance at [91] to [104] and [107] to [118] below), each loan was made in the ordinary course of Finance's business of lending money.
 That portion of the investment funded by Finance was subject to Finance's own standard terms and conditions which provided for Finance to generate a profit on the amount lent to the borrowing entity in each case (see [21] above).
 The applicants do not dispute that the quantum of capital expenditure on the assets of BHPDRI was recorded in the books of account of BHPDRI and totals approximately $2.16 billion for the period from 1 June 1995 to 30 June 2000..
