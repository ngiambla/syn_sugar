 On 31 July 2008, the applicant filed a fresh proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court again seeking judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal delivered on 19 December 2006, being the same decision that he had previously challenged.
 This was a proposition considered and rejected by the Federal Magistrates Court in July 2007, the Federal Court in December 2007, and in the special leave application to the High Court.
 In order to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, a litigant requires leave to appeal: see s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
