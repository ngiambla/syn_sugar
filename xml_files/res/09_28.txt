 Generally there was a depiction of the jewellery item, a printed description of the item, a printed price in black print which had been struck through (the strike-through price) and a different and highlighted price printed in red and in a larger print (the sale price).
 It is clear that the penalty imposed in that case was imposed in respect of contraventions of Pt IV of the TP Act, and was determined under s 76 of the TP Act as a civil pecuniary penalty.
 After all, the purpose of the catalogue was to induce sales of the items depicted, and the point of the strike-through price was to provide to consumers a contrast with the sale price.
 Although s 155(1) of the TP Act was utilised by the prosecutor, the defendant then came formally to offer its cooperation to the prosecutor and sought to discuss how it might demonstrate its commitment to compliance with the TP Act.
