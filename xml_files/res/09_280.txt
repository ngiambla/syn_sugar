 The billing statement records the "commissionable fare" in respect of each ticket issued, the amount of commission payable on each ticket, as well as the relevant taxes that are to be collected by the airline.
 Looking at the express terms of the Agency Agreement only, that amount is the amount flowing from the determination of the manner and amount by the airline exercising the right conferred by clause 9 of the Agency Agreement.
 The definition focuses on an amount that would be perceived by the passenger as the fare because it is either the amount charged and paid as the fare or the amount published as the fare.
