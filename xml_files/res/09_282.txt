 The evidence as to when any threats by the respondents concerning Pecaform occurred dates that communication in February 2008, which falsifies the statement by Mr Underwood that the adoption of the name "Footi-Form" "recently", was "as a result of the respondents' threats".
 In fact, Danley applied for the registration of the Trade Mark "Footi-Form" in July 2007, and the internal sales documents for Danley record as Footi-Form sales, sales of Pecaform product, from July 2005 to the end of January 2008.
