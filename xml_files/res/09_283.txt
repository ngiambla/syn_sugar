 Next, it was said that Mr Phillips did not disclose that he had undergone, and was required to undergo medical treatment and surveillance of his Barrett's oesophagus.
 It was said that the onus was on the respondent to establish that in October 2002 Mr Phillips had in his consciousness (and had not forgotten) that the name of his condition was Barrett's oesophagus.
 Dr Spurge said that he told Mr Phillips that he had been diagnosed as having Barrett's oesophagus and that he explained to Mr Phillips in substance that Barrett's oesophagus is a disease of the oesophagus caused by excess exposure to gastric acid.
 Mr Phillips was aware of this fact and aware that he was then engaged in prophylactic medical steps to reduce the risk that the condition posed to his life expectancy.
 Secondly, it was said that Mr Phillips did not disclose that he had undergone, and was required to undergo, medical treatment and surveillance of his Barrett's oesophagus.
 Thirdly, it was said that Mr Phillips had not told Mrs Banks that he had received medical advice to the effect that Barrett's oesophagus increased the risk of developing oesophageal cancer.
 It was also contended that Mrs Banks did not ask Mr Phillips a question the correct answer for which was express reference to Barrett's oesophagus or treatment or risk connected with that condition.
 As to the second misrepresentation, the respondent alleged that Mr Phillips in giving the answer recorded by Mrs Banks to question D(19) of the health evaluation form made a misrepresentation.
 The respondent contended that the answer given by Mr Phillips was false because Mr Phillips did not disclose at the interview with Mrs Banks that he contemplated undergoing a further gastroscopy in November 2003.
 Mr Phillips had after contracting the ulcers been diagnosed with Barrett's oesophagus and was engaged in medical treatment and procedures to prevent the formation of further ulcers.
