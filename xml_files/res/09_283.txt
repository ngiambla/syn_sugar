 Mr Phillips knew that, notwithstanding his fitness, it was still necessary for him to take Zoton daily and to undergo at two-yearly intervals an intrusive day long medical procedure in a hospital.
 As to the second misrepresentation, the respondent alleged that Mr Phillips in giving the answer recorded by Mrs Banks to question D(19) of the health evaluation form made a misrepresentation.
 The respondent contended that the answer given by Mr Phillips was false because Mr Phillips did not disclose at the interview with Mrs Banks that he contemplated undergoing a further gastroscopy in November 2003.
