 The cases have no relevance where income is not derived through labour or employment but is derived from study. " Thirdly, the applicant contended that the Tribunal had erred in taking into consideration the fact that "the income from Youth Allowance cannot be increased or altered by incurring any expenditure".
 However, the Commissioner sought to refute the applicant's contention that such expenses were incidental or necessary to her gaining Youth Allowance, arguing at [34]-[35] of his submissions that; 'The gaining of, or the receipt of such income benefit, is independently determined by the applicant's enrolment in a course of qualifying full time study and by her satisfying and maintaining the eligibility requirements for the receipt of Youth Allowance.
 The expenses may have been a necessary pre-requisite to the applicant undertaking her study but they are not relevant and incidental to her gaining Youth Allowance in a similar way that incurring travelling expenses in getting to and from work are not relevant and incidental to earning assessable income from employment.
 For example, "a person whose business is the publication of a food guide may buy and taste food in the course of his business, so there is a clear nexus between the expenditure and the derivation of income. " According to the Commissioner, the Commonwealth had paid the applicant Youth Allowance because she was a student; however she was not paid for studying per se.
