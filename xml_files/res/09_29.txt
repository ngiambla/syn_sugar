 That document set out background to the SCR technology and the Nonox AdBlue business, distribution channels for AdBlue, projected financial results for the period 2008-2013 (revenue, EBITDA, net cash flow, cumulative cash flow), assumptions underlying the financial projections, and the proposed strategy for achieving the projected financial results. 14.
