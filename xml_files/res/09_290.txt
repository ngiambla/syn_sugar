 Those acting on behalf of Ms Margarula subsequently filed a notice of motion dated 24 February 2009 seeking orders, among others, that: "The Docket Judge, his Honour Justice Reeves, disqualify himself from further hearing or determining the proceedings. " During the hearing of that application on 5 March 2009, it was agreed between the parties that my advice was given to the ACD Corporation.
 However, on the present question whether a notice of motion is appropriate, I respectfully agree with the conclusions of Finkelstein J in Centro about the explanation for the apparent conflict between Brooks and Parramatta Design and would therefore follow both Brooks and, particularly, Centro , on the appropriateness of entertaining a formal notice of motion in a disqualification application.
