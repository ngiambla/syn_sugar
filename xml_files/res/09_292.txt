 On 15 September 1999, Proctor, the company secretary of Dundee Beach P/L, copied a facsimile to Booth in which he referred to "the new shareholders" of Dundee Beach P/L having made "us" (presumably Territory Realty) a nominal offer for their shareholding.
 It was with that understanding, which was erroneous, and which was an error induced by the misleading conduct which I have found to have been made out, that Territory Realty did not take action to endeavour to frustrate the transaction which in fact occurred.
 Since 4 May 1999, when it was apparent that Kendray had sold his interest in Dundee Beach P/L and (apparently also his interest in H K Earthmoving), neither Booth nor Sanders made any step to participate in any ongoing quasi-partnership with Hassall.
