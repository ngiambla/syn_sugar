 The ground upon which the winding up itself of the company is sought is that specified in s 461(1)(k) of the Corporations Act , namely the just and equitable ground.
 My attention has helpfully been drawn to a decision of Barrett J in CIC Insurance Limited v Hannan and Co Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 437 ; (2001) 38 ACSR 245 ( CIC Insurance case).
 Of course, if the position changes, then doubtless there may be a need to review the appropriateness of Mr Khatri and Mr Worrell continuing in their capacity as provisional liquidators.
 I should expect them, given their position as court-appointed provisional liquidators and, as well, experienced practitioners in the field, to raise that of their own motion, in any event, should there be an apprehension as to conflict which did manifest itself.
