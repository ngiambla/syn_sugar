 I delivered judgement on 26 March 2009 in respect of the substantive application made by ASIC: Australian Securities and Investments Commission; in the matter of Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) v Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 269.
 Contrary to the submission made on behalf of Mr and Mrs Cassimatis, it is not correct to state that neither Exhibit MRR1 nor Exhibit MRR2 feature in the reasons for judgement in respect of ASIC's substantive application.
