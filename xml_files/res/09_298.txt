 I delivered judgement on 26 March 2009 in respect of the substantive application made by ASIC: Australian Securities and Investments Commission; in the matter of Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) v Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) [2009] FCA 269.
 They drew particular attention to Exhibits MRR1 and MRR 2 to the affidavit of Mr Ryan, an officer of ASIC, whose affidavit had been filed in Court by leave on 18 March 2009 when the originating application was likewise filed.
 Contrary to the submission made on behalf of Mr and Mrs Cassimatis, it is not correct to state that neither Exhibit MRR1 nor Exhibit MRR2 feature in the reasons for judgement in respect of ASIC's substantive application.
 In any event, the only use made of them by me is recorded in my reasons for judgement with the result that it became unnecessary to consider, given the objection, whether they had any other relevance to the proceeding.
