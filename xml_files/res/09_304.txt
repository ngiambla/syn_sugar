 The letter also proposed that the various facilities be " cross collateralised " and that all of the arrangements be formalised by way of a " multi partite deed '.
 Mr Rose said that, as a director of Riva, he was not in a position to allow Riva to incur additional debts and financial obligations without the means to repay them.
 It is significant that, at that stage, Mr Rose accepted the need for agreement between Sakkara Properties and Moruben as to the profit share, before finalisation of the Moruben Road Project.
 Mr Bevan then observed that Mr Rose was maintaining that he would not permit cross-collateralisation to the Moruben Road Property for the possible shortfall from Riva and would not provide a personal guarantee.
