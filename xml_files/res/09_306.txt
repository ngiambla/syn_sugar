 The visa application of the appellant wife is substantially dependent on the appellant husband's claim, in that although the appellant wife also claims membership of the AISSF she primarily relies on her husband's fear of persecution as supporting her claim to refugee status.
 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant husband had been arrested and abused on a number of occasions by the Punjab police in the late 1980's and mid 1990's, and that he was again beaten and tortured for 3 days in November 2001 and subsequently hospitalised.
