 I am therefore inclined to accept Mr Nobes' opinion that Wyeth will need to implement a 12.5% price reduction in Efexor-XR approximately one month before the anticipated PBS listing of the generics on 1 August 2009.
 It follows that Wyeth would need to have any claim for interlocutory relief determined by no later than 1 July 2009 to avoid passing on a reduction of 12.5% in the price of Efexor-XR.
 Second, the assumption which underlies Wyeth's claim for identity discovery is that if I were to make an order now, it would be in a position to have a claim for interlocutory relief determined by 20 July 2009.
