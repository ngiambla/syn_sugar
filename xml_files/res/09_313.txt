 Wyeth therefore requested the Department of Health and Ageing ("the Department") to provide it with information under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (the " FOI Act ") in relation to those applications.
 Wyeth's request under the FOI Act was denied in December 2008 but the information supplied in answer to the request suggested that five applications to the ARTG were made to register medicines containing venlafaxine.
 Thus, Wyeth seeks to obtain preliminary discovery at the earliest possible date, in order to provide the foundation for injunctive proceedings, including a claim for interlocutory injunctive relief.
