 Merim says that its purpose in applying for an order to inspect Style's books is to investigate whether directors and officers of Style have exercised their powers reasonably, in good faith and for a proper purpose consistent with their statutory and fiduciary duties.
 Although Style has no record of any documents being provided to Hartleys Limited at any time, the report of 31 July 2007 set out a forecast of actual results for Style for the year ended 30 June 2006, and forecasts for the financial years 2007, 2008 and 2009.
 In the course of argument I indicated to counsel for Merim that I considered some of the categories of documents sought by Merim for inspection were widely expressed and some categories were not relevant to the purpose for which the inspection was sought.
