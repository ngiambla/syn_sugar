 It is sufficient to say at this point that the Tribunal rejected the appellant's claim on this basis because the risk of harm arises from "a non-discriminatory penalty for contravention of a law of general application".
 The Tribunal then turned to consider whether the appellant's treatment following her third pregnancy, and the termination thereof, may have been influenced by a number of factors involving discrimination, which may have led to her being treated unduly harshly.
 The Tribunal referred to what it said was well established, namely, that enforcement of a generally applicable law does not ordinarily constitute persecution for the purposes of the Convention, for the reason that enforcement of such a law does not ordinarily constitute discrimination.
 The Tribunal found the appellant had a well-founded fear of serious harm (that is, forced sterilisation) and it seems to me that it would be open to it to conclude that the harm was for reasons of her membership of the social group and not for the reason of the application of a law of general application.
