 It is sufficient to say at this point that the Tribunal rejected the appellant's claim on this basis because the risk of harm arises from "a non-discriminatory penalty for contravention of a law of general application".
 The Tribunal referred to what it said was well established, namely, that enforcement of a generally applicable law does not ordinarily constitute persecution for the purposes of the Convention, for the reason that enforcement of such a law does not ordinarily constitute discrimination.
