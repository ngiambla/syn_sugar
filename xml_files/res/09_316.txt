 Prior to 10 March 2009, Mr Campbell was able to gain access to the Computershare full registry service provided to the Company by remote electronic access and the use of a password provided to him as a director.
 Counsel for the Company submitted that the common law right arises on the basis of a director having access for the purposes of the Company, and that if that access is not sought in the interests of the Company, then the common law right could not be availed of.
 It is important to emphasise that on this application, having regard to the fact that no parties have been cross-examined, and that the matter has been brought on as a matter of urgency, that I form no view as to the merits or demerits of the matters raised by Mr Campbell or Mr Pursell.
