 On that occasion, the Court directed the applicants to serve a document by 16 March 2009, no longer than two pages, setting out the orders which they seek from the Court, including the persons against whom the orders are sought, and a very brief reference to the facts on which they relied to claim each of the orders.
 Furthermore, the motion of 26 March 2009 was short served, and at least the first respondent was not in a position to obtain instructions about the contents of the affidavit in support.
 In order to understand the need for urgent relief which the applicants claim, the Court asked Ms Lydia Desai, the first applicant who speaks on behalf the second applicant, to explain what was sought as a matter of immediate relief.
 By this, it is understood that the applicants seek that the Court declare that the alleged persecution of the staff and students of the BOSS School in India by the Indian judiciary amounts to a genocide.
