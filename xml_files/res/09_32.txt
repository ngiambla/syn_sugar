 It is important to note that the decision of Moore J in relation to security for costs was an interlocutory decision and that consequently leave must be obtained, and also that the current application was out of time so that an extension of time is required.
 In addition, the order in relation to security for costs was a discretionary judgment which on accepted principles will not be varied unless it is shown that exercise of that discretion was miscarried for specific reasons, or more generally that the decision is outside the limits of what could be considered to be sound discretionary judgment: see House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5.
