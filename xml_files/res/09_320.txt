 The applicants stated that, at the trial, they proposed to allege that the Court should infer that there were other such reports, although they are not now in the respondent's possession.
 In addition, as indicated above, the applicants sought discovery of two categories of documents: (a) the Respondent's policies or practices with respect to the retention and/or destruction of documents (including, but not limited to, email and MySingle correspondence); and (b) any variations or exceptions to those policies or practices implemented since November 2006.
 The respondent noted (and it may be accepted for present purposes) that [28F] was not concerned with all emails but with a specific category of in-house emails, which was in the nature of an in-house instant messaging program and subject to the respondent's email management policies.
 The respondent noted (and it may be accepted) that the applicants did not allege that there was any reprehensible aspect to these policies or that any deleted emails were likely to have included emails relevant to an issue in the proceeding.
