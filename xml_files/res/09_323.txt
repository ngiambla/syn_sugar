 This is an application filed on 9 February 2009 made under sections 480 and 542 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Corporations Act ") for orders for the release of a liquidator of Lynari Pty Ltd, the deregistration of the company and the destruction of the books of the company.
 The application is supported primarily by an affidavit sworn 9 February 2009 by Mr Nick Jim Combis who was appointed liquidator of the company on 20 March 2008 pursuant to an order of the court winding up the company in insolvency.
 The material demonstrates that the requirements of rule 7.5(2)(a) of the Corporations Rules have been met and a statement setting out the terms of section 481 subsection (3) of the Corporations Act is incorporated within the application.
