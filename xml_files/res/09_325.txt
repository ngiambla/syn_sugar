 I directed that that letter be sent by prepaid post to each of the persons detailed in letters which were exhibits A, B and C to an affidavit of Susan Jane Gilmore filed on 29 September 2008.
 I directed that on or before Friday, 13 March 2009, any affidavits to be relied on by the State in respect of the show cause requirement be filed and served and that the Applicant show cause today why the application should not be dismissed pursuant to s 84D of the Act for want of authorisation.
 I further directed that a copy of the order be sent by the Deputy District Registrar to the persons mentioned in the letters which are exhibits A, B and C in Ms Gilmore's affidavit to which I have previously referred.
 The wider background to this case is that an application for the review of a decision by the Registrar not to register the claim was heard by Collier J on 16 November 2007.
