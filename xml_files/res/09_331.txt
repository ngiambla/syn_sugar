 By reply email dated 18 March 2008, the applicants' solicitors asserted that the patent was granted upon the first divisional application, which was itself a divisional application based on the grandparent application.
 Indeed, at one point, counsel for Screenex submitted that the second request was not to be understood as an amendment to the second divisional application, but as a purported application in its own right.
 Screenex contends that the applicants (and, inferentially, Weatherford's predecessors in title) have not been open and frank about how the second error came about, and have not explained why it was not detected earlier.
 It is true, as counsel for Screenex pointed out, that, since the lapsing of the first divisional application in June 2000, a new divisional application based on that application could not have been made, and could not now be made.
