 Specifically, Roadshow relies upon its claim that iiNet users ' electronically transmitted ' the whole or substantial parts of the films to other BitTorrent users which, according to Roadshow's logic, must be sufficient to give rise to an ' infringing copy ' for the purposes of a conversion by iiNet.
 If iiNet has stored cinematograph films in a similar fashion to their users (albeit for a ' transient ' time) in the course of ' transmitting, routing or providing connections ' such fact appears to raise quite a different issue to that which is considered at [43] above.
