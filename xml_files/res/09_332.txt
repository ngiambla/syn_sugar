 However, iiNet submits that the acts of Mr Herps and Mr Fraser referred to in their affidavits were carried out pursuant to s 104 of the Copyright Act which provides that copyright is not infringed by acts done for the purpose of a judicial proceeding.
 Specifically, Roadshow relies upon its claim that iiNet users ' electronically transmitted ' the whole or substantial parts of the films to other BitTorrent users which, according to Roadshow's logic, must be sufficient to give rise to an ' infringing copy ' for the purposes of a conversion by iiNet.
 If iiNet has stored cinematograph films in a similar fashion to their users (albeit for a ' transient ' time) in the course of ' transmitting, routing or providing connections ' such fact appears to raise quite a different issue to that which is considered at [43] above.
 Paragraph 67F of the ASOC --- primary infringement claim In addition to Roadshow's claim that the iiNet users have infringed copyright in the films and that iiNet has authorised such conduct, Roadshow relies upon some of the same paragraphs as the conversion claim in support of a claim that iiNet itself has infringed the copyright in the films ('primary infringement').
