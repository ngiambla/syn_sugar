 The cross-claimants contend that each group company was solvent prior to the commencement by ASIC of its application to wind up two group members, Ann Street and York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (York Street).
 The result of these procedures is that the creditor is required to establish the insolvency of the company both at the time of filing the application (or under the old procedure the presentation of the petition) and at the hearing.
 He went on to say that "[n]either ASIC nor the administrators were able to point to any reason why the court should not proceed immediately to a winding-up order".
 The third issue is whether the judge's finding of insolvency precludes the cross-claimants mounting a claim against ASIC founded on the assertion that York Street and Ann Street were solvent at the time the winding up applications were filed.
