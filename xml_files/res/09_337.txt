 Rule 7(5) of the 1968 Bankruptcy Rules also stated that where the Registrar was satisfied that the application for a bankruptcy notice had been duly made to him, "the Registrar shall sign each of [the] copies [of the bankruptcy notice furnished in accordance with r 7(2)(b)] and return them to the applicant".
 If that is so, it would be an absurd construction of the Bankruptcy Act and the Bankruptcy Regulations if the practical result was that personal service required that the debtor receive an original notice in some circumstances but not in others.
