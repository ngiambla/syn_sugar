 A bankruptcy notice is a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act : Adams at [17] and the authorities cited and Re Wheeler Reynolds; Ex parte Kerr v Crowe [1988] FCA 381 ; (1988) 20 FCR 185 , 190 (cf T and S Recoveries Pty Ltd v Skalkos in the matter of Skalkos [2004] FCA 816 at [26] ).
 Rule 7(5) of the 1968 Bankruptcy Rules also stated that where the Registrar was satisfied that the application for a bankruptcy notice had been duly made to him, "the Registrar shall sign each of [the] copies [of the bankruptcy notice furnished in accordance with r 7(2)(b)] and return them to the applicant".
 If that is so, it would be an absurd construction of the Bankruptcy Act and the Bankruptcy Regulations if the practical result was that personal service required that the debtor receive an original notice in some circumstances but not in others.
 Secondly, reg 16.01(2) provides that although service in accordance with reg 16.01(1) is prima facie evidence of service, it is at least open to the debtor to adduce evidence to the contrary: see Stephen Mullette, 'Secret Service' (2008) 16 Insolvency Law Journal 195, 199.
