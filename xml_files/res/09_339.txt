 In relation to the investigation of the applicant's complaint, Ms Bradley and Ms Young met in the morning of 24 April 2007 with the applicant to discuss the protocols of the investigation and the processes involved in conducting the investigation.
 At times Ms Fernandes described (to Mr Stokes) the applicant as "unmanageable", while also pointing out that the applicant was argumentative, would not listen and would not provide her with the information that she had requested.
