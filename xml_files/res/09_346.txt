 Mr Skalkos there said, for example, that at his first meeting with Mr Nicols, which he accepted in his oral evidence was 25 February 2005, Mr Nicols made reference to the statement of affairs provided by Mr Skalkos and Mr Nicols then suggested that Mr Skalkos pay a contribution of $200 per week.
 In the proceedings before me there was also other material that suggested Mr Skalkos gave 31A New South Head Road, Vaucluse as his residential address during the relevant period and more recently.
 In the circumstances, an inference is readily available that Mr Skalkos' case would not be assisted either by the evidence of Mr Minas or Mr Thomas, or by the evidence of any person who knew the truth about his domestic arrangements during the period of his bankruptcy.
 I would only have been prepared to interfere with Mr Nicols' administration of Mr Skalkos' estate had I been satisfied that there was a very clear case requiring the correction of unjustified error.
