 In the proceedings before me there was also other material that suggested Mr Skalkos gave 31A New South Head Road, Vaucluse as his residential address during the relevant period and more recently.
 I would only have been prepared to interfere with Mr Nicols' administration of Mr Skalkos' estate had I been satisfied that there was a very clear case requiring the correction of unjustified error.
