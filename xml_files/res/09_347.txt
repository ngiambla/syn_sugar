 Until those facts occur, not only will a prospective applicant not know whether there is a cause of action (which, in the absence of fraud, may be fatal to an applicant's ability to sue), there will be no cause of action in existence.
 It is not the applicant's position that the representations relied on here were not misleading when made but became misleading at some future date, but rather that they were shown to have been misleading at the time they were made by events which occurred at a later date.
 That sub-section rather throws the evidentiary burden on a respondent to establish that reasonable grounds for making the representation existed and in the absence of such evidence the deeming provision has the consequence that the representation is taken to be misleading.
 They do not, any more than do the observations in Wardley , therefore, give direct support to the possibility I earlier discussed that denunciation or failure of the asserted representations might be an integral part of the causes of action.
