 Section 4(3) defines both "Excise Tariff" and "Excise Tariff alteration" as follows: A reference in this Act or in any other Act to an Excise Tariff or Excise Tariff alteration proposed in the Parliament shall be read as a reference to an Excise Tariff or Excise Tariff alteration proposed by a motion moved in the House of Representatives, and an Excise Tariff or Excise Tariff alteration proposed by a motion so moved shall be deemed to have been proposed in the Parliament at the time at which the motion was moved.
 Consistent with the terms of s 4(3) of the Excise Act , the Excise Tariff alteration retains its status as such and, thereby, the protection of s 114 in accordance with the terms of that section.
 Suntory's submission that any new Bill introduced into Parliament would be a different Excise Tariff alteration cannot be sustained in the face of ss 4(3) and 114 of the Excise Act and against the background of s 57 of the Constitution .
 The reference to Excise Tariff alteration in condition 3(c) of Suntory's permission under s 61C of the Excise Act takes the same meaning as the definition of that term in the Excise Act (s 46 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth)).
