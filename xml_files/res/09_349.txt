 Following the issue of the notes, it appears that BBL granted loans to BBIPL and that the amount presently outstanding from BBIPL to BBL, pursuant to the loans, is approximately $621,904,000.
 Mr Lombe has set out in his affidavit the opinion that an extension of the convening period for four months is justified and that it is in the interests of creditors of BBL.
 I am satisfied that it is appropriate to grant an extension of time to convene the meeting, However, I have given careful consideration to the question of what is an appropriate time for an extension.
