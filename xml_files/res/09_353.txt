 This, as Moore J described at [1], was "pleaded in a number of ways in the statement of claim. " Moore J observed that Cowdroy J had heard and dismissed a similar application in the matter of Croker v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 372.
 First, Mr Croker says that the Court does have jurisdiction to hear his claim, referring to s 56 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and other cases in which the Court has heard and determined suits against the Commonwealth in tort.
 Fourth, Mr Croker says that this Court, even if it did not have jurisdiction, could and should make an order transferring his proceedings to a court of competent jurisdiction such as a State Supreme Court.
 The Commissioner said where the Court does not have jurisdiction it would not, or could not, make any order transferring the proceeding and, in any event, this was an application for leave to appeal.
