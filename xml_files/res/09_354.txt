 Charge 1 is a claim that the respondent has been guilty of contempt in publishing information on 18 August 2006 which conveyed the imputations referred to in paragraph 2(a)(iii) and paragraph 3(c) of the September 2002 orders.
 Charge 5 and Charge 16 The publications which are said to breach the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking are exhibited as Exhibits "Q", "R" and "S" to the affidavit of the applicant's solicitor Mr Lewis sworn on 10 December 2007.
 I find that charges 12 and 23 have been proved and that, contrary to the September 2002 orders and the November 2007 undertaking, the respondent published the AI Document on the Adelaide Institute website.
