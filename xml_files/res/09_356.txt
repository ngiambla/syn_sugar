 First, I think s 31 and s 40, and other sections in the Act which refer to matters being prescribed by regulations, are at least part of the regulation-making power because they identify expressly a subject matter about which regulations may be made.
 The combined operation of reg 2.12 and cl 850.211 means that the group identified in s 48 of the Act, other than those persons who have been the subject of a s 501 refusal or a s 501 cancellation, may apply for the relevant visa.
 The argument is that it is not open to the regulation-maker to prescribe a class of visa for the purposes of s 48 of the Act if a criterion for that class of visa immediately disentitles a sub-group of the group identified in s 48 from applying for that class of visa.
