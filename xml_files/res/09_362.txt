 The appellant said that she signed the forms because she trusted her migration agent to include all of her story in the application and to know the procedures for becoming a refugee.
 The appellant went on to depose that she had subsequently found out that the address which was included in her protection visa application prepared by the migration agent was false.
 The appellant submitted that the Federal Magistrate erred by not giving due weight to the concession by the first respondent that the Tribunal's decision was affected by jurisdictional error.
