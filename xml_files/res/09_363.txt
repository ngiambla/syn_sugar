 Specific Claim --- Confidential Information The applicant in the present case has made a specific, not a global, claim for protection, in relation to the subject information, and which, in particular, extends beyond identification of documents to identifying certain features and advantages included in the design of a new or improved design of a rail freight wagon: (a) as at circa April 1996 (Lynx 1996 Confidential Information).
 Section 52 TPA In relation to the pleading under s 52 of the TPA, Lynx argues that Bradken has conducted itself in a manner that is false and misleading in trade and commerce, in that it has represented: Lynx argues that the design for the Lynx Golynx Wagon is 'well and favourably known' in the Australian rail freight market.
