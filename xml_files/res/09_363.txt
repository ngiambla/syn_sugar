 Specific Claim --- Confidential Information The applicant in the present case has made a specific, not a global, claim for protection, in relation to the subject information, and which, in particular, extends beyond identification of documents to identifying certain features and advantages included in the design of a new or improved design of a rail freight wagon: (a) as at circa April 1996 (Lynx 1996 Confidential Information).
 Pursuant to the 1996 Confidentiality Agreement, as pleaded in para 8, the particulars of disclosure of the relevant Lynx 1996 Confidential Information are particularised in (1)-(4) therein; and (b) in relation to the Lynx 1997 Confidential Information, which concerned an extension of the project in respect of the Lynx 3CR12 Wagon Project, extended to various modifications, enhancements and improvements to the Lynx 3CR12 Wagon design ("Improved Lynx 3CR12 Design") .
 Section 52 TPA In relation to the pleading under s 52 of the TPA, Lynx argues that Bradken has conducted itself in a manner that is false and misleading in trade and commerce, in that it has represented: Lynx argues that the design for the Lynx Golynx Wagon is 'well and favourably known' in the Australian rail freight market.
