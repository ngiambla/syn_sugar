 To ensure that grants under the EMDG Act might continue to be payable to a grantee, s 93(2) of the EMDG Act provides: To achieve this, this Division requires the CEO of Austrade to treat certain particulars of the previous owner of the business as being those of the new owner.
 Austrade has carefully examined and taken into account the criteria set out in the Ministerial Guideline EMDG (Change of Ownership Guideline) 2006 in deciding whether Isaac Jewellery P/L should be treated as a continuation of the old business.
 Having taken into account the criteria specified in the Guidelines, the Senior Member concluded: I have therefore come to the view, having regard to the factors identified in the Guidelines, that Isaac Jewellery is [sic] neither carries on the same business, or part of the same business, carried on by ABJ, nor does it carry on a business similar to the business, or part of the business, carried on by ABJ to such an extent that the new business should be treated as a continuation of the old business.
 Isaac Jewellery also submits that Austrade did not contend that any of the matters advanced by Isaac Jewellery under s 94(1)(b)(i) of the EMDG Act were irrelevant to the consideration of the matters in that subparagraph and refutes the submission of Austrade that the Tribunal conflated its task by considering ss 94(1)(b)(i) and 94(1)(b)(ii) together.
