 I was informed when the case was called on for trial in Jemella Australia's opening that it was not desired on its part to press for either an account for profits or for damages.
 At an earlier stage in the proceedings, and at a time when Jemella Australia envisaged that it would seek a default judgment, an affidavit of Kelly Maree Gardner was filed on 12 March 2009.
 I say "unnecessary" because it seems to me that, on any view, a taxing officer would necessarily allow at least the sum of $8000 on a party and party basis in respect of the costs incurred by Jemella Australia up to and including trial.
