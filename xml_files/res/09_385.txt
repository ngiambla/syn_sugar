 I informed the parties that I proposed to hear their respective arguments on the grounds set out in the applicant's draft notice of appeal accompanying her application for an extension of time and deal with both that application and, if it be granted, the appeal, at the same time.
 It is not possible, in my view, to read that paragraph as a conclusion or finding on a material question of fact or mixed fact and law for which there was no evidence or for which the only evidence was to the contrary of the finding.
