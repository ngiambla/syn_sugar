 In response to Mr Watts' communication, Registry staff informed him that he would need to make the application which he was seeking to make in the correspondence to which I have referred by way of formal Notice of Motion supported by an affidavit or affidavits.
 The notice disputing the Bankruptcy Notice is dated 8 April 2009 and has attached to it a calculation which Mr Watts submits constitutes the correct calculation showing the present state of the account between the plaintiff and the first defendant in respect of the two loans made by the first defendant to the plaintiff in 2004.
 With the exception of the two paragraphs to which I have already referred and Annexure 2A to the affidavit, the annexures to Mr Watts' affidavit of 14 April 2009 comprise documents all of which could have been tendered at the hearing before me on 10 December 2008.
 Mr Watts told me that his main concern was to ensure that I had, in the one place and in a manner which was clear and coherent, his contentions concerning the correct way of calculating the amounts due under the loan agreements (if any).
