 If the Tribunal had proceeded to such a decision before the passage of a reasonable time, in the circumstances of the case, it would not have performed its statutory function of reviewing the decision of the Minister's delegate.
 The appellant informed me in the course of the hearing of the appeal that he had been ready and able to pay the fee, if his application for a decision that the fee should not be paid were to be unsuccessful.
 It is likely that, in those circumstances, the Tribunal would have determined that a reasonable time had not elapsed, would have accepted the fee from the appellant, and would have proceeded to deal with his application for review of the decision of the Minister's delegate.
