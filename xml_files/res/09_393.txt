 On 15 January 2009, the applicants commenced proceedings against the respondent in the Court's Western Australia District Registry at Perth for damages and injunctive relief for infringement of registered trade marks and design, and misleading and deceptive conduct.
 The Western Australia District Registry is the "proper place" within the meaning of that expression in O 1, r 4 of the Federal Court Rules (the Rules) unless a transfer is ordered.
 By motion dated 31 March 2009, the respondent applied, pursuant to s 48 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and O 10 r 1(2)(f) of the Rules, for an order transferring the proceedings to the Court's New South Wales District Registry at Sydney.
 The Court also stated (at page 162) that due weight should be given to the reason for which the party commencing the proceedings chose the particular place in which the proceedings were commenced and the stage of the proceedings.
