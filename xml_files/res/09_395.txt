 The notice, amongst other things, stated that the Chairman of ACCC believed that Narnia was capable of furnishing information and producing documents relating to the matters that may constitute contravention of ss 51AB, 52 and 53 of the Act.
 ACCC suspected that Narnia and Mr Clarke did not follow the complaints handling procedure so that they could mislead Mr Hack into believing that he was not entitled to get his $1,800 back and that he should pay a further $1,950 before he would be released from the agreement.
 That response was false in that Mr Clarke never invoked cl 3 of the agreement and never notified Mr Hack that the $1,800 payment would be sufficient to cover the administrative costs and expenses of ordering and procuring the hairpiece.
