 These reasons which relate to the costs of the proceeding should be read in conjunction with the reasons given today in Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited ACN 111 052 585 v Hardel Investments Pty Limited ACN 083 276 000 [2009] FCA 399.
 Those proceedings were brought on 28 March 2008 by Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited (CBH) and Alpha Asset Group Pty Ltd (Alpha) to wind up Hardel Investments Pty Limited (Hardel) and Avpri Pty Limited (Avpri) (the winding up proceedings).
 In the winding up proceedings CBH and Alpha claimed that they had served statutory demands upon Hardel and Avpri on 18 December 2007 for debts which were then due and payable together with an affidavit that verified that the debts were then due and payable: s 459E(2) and s 459E(3).
 Hardel and Avpri claimed in the winding up proceedings that they did not receive or were not served with any statutory demand prior to the issue of the winding up proceedings on 28 March 2008 or service of the winding up proceedings on 7 April 2008.
 CBH and Alpha were always on notice before the commencement of the winding up proceedings that the debts were a matter of dispute and that Hardel and Avpri claimed they had never been served with any statutory demands.
 An affidavit was filed in accordance with rule 5.4(2) which purported to verify service of the statutory demand, the failure of Hardel and Avpri to comply and a claim that the debts were still due and payable.
 The statutory demand and the affidavit accompanying the statutory demand which were said to be served on Hardel and Avpri on 18 December 2007 were exhibited to the affidavit.
 I have never sighted a copy, and neither Hardel nor Avpri has received, or had delivered to it, an original or a copy of a statutory demand signed on behalf of CBH or Alpha.
 The grounds on which the applications to set aside have been brought are as follows: 101.1. the statutory demands were defective and/or not statutory demands for the purposes of section 459E of the Act in that: 101.1.1.
 The plaintiffs and each of Mr James Warren Byrnes, Mrs Catherine Gina Byrnes, Dr Justin Peter Low, Mrs Elizabeth Laura Low and Messrs Simmons and McCartney pay the defendant's, [Hardel Investments Pty Limited ACN 083 276 000 and Avpri Pty Limited ACN 109 814 057], costs on an indemnity basis.
 They contend that this proceeding was unnecessary and whatever the fate of the winding up proceedings, this proceeding should be dismissed and Hardel and Avpri should pay their costs.
 I am mindful of the definition of "statutory demand" in s 9 of the Corporations Act as it means a document that is or purports to be a demand under s 459E.
