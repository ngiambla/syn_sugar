 I draw attention to the following aspects of the proxy form: (a) On the first page under the heading " Appointment of Proxy " the following was stated: " Voting 100% of your holding : Direct your proxy how to vote by marking one of the boxes opposite each item of business.
 The applicants submitted that the central issue for determination was whether the conduct of the Chairman in not voting the undecided proxies in favour of each item of business constituted a breach of one or more of: (a) clause 50.6 of the Company's Constitution in effect at the time of the meeting; (b) section 250A(4)(c) of the Act; (c) the Chairman's relevant duty at common law.
 It was submitted that those words must be read together with the Chairman's intention and so read together, the reference to "the following directions" in "STEP 1" must be a reference to all of "STEP 2" of the proxy form which included the indication of the Chairman's intention.
 By marking the box in "STEP 1" appointing the Chairman of the Meeting the proxy, or by not completing that box or the box next to it for the appointment of another person to be the proxy and by not completing or marking any of the boxes in "STEP 2" marked "For", "Against" and "Abstain", the member was giving a direction to the Chairman of the Meeting to vote as the proxy, that is as the Chairman, saw fit.
