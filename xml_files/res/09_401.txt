 By marking the box in "STEP 1" appointing the Chairman of the Meeting the proxy, or by not completing that box or the box next to it for the appointment of another person to be the proxy and by not completing or marking any of the boxes in "STEP 2" marked "For", "Against" and "Abstain", the member was giving a direction to the Chairman of the Meeting to vote as the proxy, that is as the Chairman, saw fit.
