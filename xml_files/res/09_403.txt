 That affidavit had been sent to Paul Drabsch on 30 March 2009 and Paul Drabsch confirmed at the directions hearing on 8 April 2009 his receipt of that affidavit on or about that date.
 The material establishes that Paul Drabsch was the registrant for the website and that in the face of letters of complaint Paul Drabsch caused steps to be taken to remove the material complained of by the applicant from the first respondent's website.
 That ground goes to the directions hearing on 8 April 2009 and the service on 7 April 2009 of the proposed notice of motion and the affidavit of Ms Barrett.
