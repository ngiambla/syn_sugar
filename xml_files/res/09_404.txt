 Subsequently, the judgment was obtained, Adelaide Bank entered into possession of the property, the property was sold by Adelaide Bank as mortgagee in possession and the net sale proceeds were brought to account against the judgment debt.
 At the hearing on 10 December 2008, Mr Watts conceded that there was in existence as at 21 August 2007 a debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank but submitted that the correct amount of the debt due from BMG to Adelaide Bank at that time was $16,281.29.
 However, Adelaide Bank did not seek to vary the amount of the Statutory Demand and informed me that it intended to proceed upon the basis of the amount set out in the Statutory Demand.
