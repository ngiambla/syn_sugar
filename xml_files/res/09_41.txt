 Edmonds J decided (at [31]) that the expression "the Australian income tax" in subpara (1)(a) of Art 2 of the Swiss Agreement meant income tax as assessed under the ITAA 1936, and (at [49]) that the expression included tax on net capital gains under the Pt IIIA rgime.
 If the assumption to be made is that the Pt IIIA rgime tax is not within the expression "the Commonwealth income tax" because the latter expression embraces only tax on income according to ordinary concepts, then the Pt IIIA rgime tax is not substantially similar to "the Commonwealth income tax".
