 Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) (hereafter Storm Financial) has, on the initiative of its present liquidators, previously the administrators of that company, made application for the winding-up of Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group Pty Ltd (Provisional Liquidators Appointed) (hereafter Victorian Families).
 The shareholding of Storm Financial in Victorian Families is one of the assets subject to the charge which led to the appointment of the receivers and managers to Storm Financial.
 I will make an order that the Applicant's costs be costs in the winding up, and I will direct that the applicant bring in short minutes to reflect the orders made today.
