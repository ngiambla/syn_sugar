 This is an appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (Smith FM) given on 14 November 2008 ([2008] FMCA 1576) ('the Judgment') dismissing an application to set aside Bankruptcy Notice No.
 The notice of appeal in this Court seeks an order that the Judgment be set aside and an order that the Bankruptcy Notice be stayed until the High Court of Australia has determined the appellant's application for special leave to appeal from a judgment of the New South Wales Court of Appeal (see Miller v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2008] NSWCA 222).
 The two certificates related to party and party costs orders which had been made in the District Court by Delaney DCJ on 31 January 2008 and by Beazley JA in the New South Wales Court of Appeal on 16 June 2008.
 The existence of the costs orders, the assessments and the judgment debt is not in dispute, but the appellant invited the Federal Magistrates Court, and invited this Court, to look behind the costs order of Delaney DCJ so as to find that, in effect, it ought not to have been made because the appellant's substantive claim in the District Court should not have been dismissed.
 He also invited the Federal Magistrates Court to examine the reasoning of Beazley JA, who refused the appellant an extension of time for bringing an appeal from the judgment of Delaney DCJ (see Miller v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2008] NSWCA, unreported, 16 June 2008), and also to examine the reasoning of Hodgson JA, Bell JA and Gyles AJA in the Court of Appeal when refusing his application for review of Beazley JA's judgment.
 After service of the Bankruptcy Notice, the appellant unsuccessfully applied to the New South Wales Court of Appeal for a stay on the two costs orders and the judgment debt based on the costs assessments.
 The Federal Magistrate considered the appellant's submissions in that regard concluding at [12]: None of the points raised by Mr Miller before me today, in my opinion, raise anything near a sufficient case to justify this Court doubting the foundation for the judgment debt, either in relation to Delaney DCJ's substantive judgment, or the costs orders and assessments which have resulted in the bankruptcy notice.
