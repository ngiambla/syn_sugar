 This is an appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (Smith FM) given on 14 November 2008 ([2008] FMCA 1576) ('the Judgment') dismissing an application to set aside Bankruptcy Notice No.
 The notice of appeal in this Court seeks an order that the Judgment be set aside and an order that the Bankruptcy Notice be stayed until the High Court of Australia has determined the appellant's application for special leave to appeal from a judgment of the New South Wales Court of Appeal (see Miller v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2008] NSWCA 222).
 The two certificates related to party and party costs orders which had been made in the District Court by Delaney DCJ on 31 January 2008 and by Beazley JA in the New South Wales Court of Appeal on 16 June 2008.
 The existence of the costs orders, the assessments and the judgment debt is not in dispute, but the appellant invited the Federal Magistrates Court, and invited this Court, to look behind the costs order of Delaney DCJ so as to find that, in effect, it ought not to have been made because the appellant's substantive claim in the District Court should not have been dismissed.
