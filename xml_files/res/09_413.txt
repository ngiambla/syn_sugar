 DR FLICK: No, that's not --- confidentiality is a basis and it may be a material basis upon which a claim for privilege is made but it is not - - - HIS HONOUR: What is the other basis?
 Mr Watson repeatedly denied that he had this knowledge and, in substance, said that he was diverted from considering that informer immunity or whistleblower immunity was the basis for ASIC's PII claim by the statements made by ASIC's counsel on 7 August 2007 and 11 September 2007.
 I have no doubt that Mr Watson was diverted from concluding that the basis of ASIC's PII claim was whistleblower or informer privilege by the stance taken by ASIC through its counsel on 7 August 2007 and 11 September 2007.
 As I have noted earlier, Mr Watson's evidence was that for the reasons he gave extensively in examination-in-chief and cross-examination he was diverted from, or turned away from, considering or believing that the basis for ASIC's claim for PII was informer privilege or protection of the identity of informers.
