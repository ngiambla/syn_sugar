 Federal Magistrate erred in law in the exercise of his discretion in that he failed to take into account relevant factors, namely that the previous proceedings instituted by the appellants were flawed and contrary to the documentary evidence.
 It is plain from this affidavit and from the written and oral submissions advanced by Mr and Mrs Scott that they are dissatisfied with the Magistrate's order because they consider that the earlier cases in the High Court, this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court were all wrongly decided.
 It was plainly open to him to conclude that the human rights case which he had determined was a vexatious proceeding and that Mr and Mrs Scott had "habitually, persistently and without reasonable grounds instituted other vexatious proceedings" in this Court over many years.
 In oral argument, Mr and Mrs Scott sought to introduce an additional argument with a view to persuading the court that the Federal Magistrate was in error in holding that their arguments were utterly hopeless.
