 Federal Magistrate erred in law in the exercise of his discretion in that he failed to take into account relevant factors, namely that the previous proceedings instituted by the appellants were flawed and contrary to the documentary evidence.
 It is plain from this affidavit and from the written and oral submissions advanced by Mr and Mrs Scott that they are dissatisfied with the Magistrate's order because they consider that the earlier cases in the High Court, this Court and the Federal Magistrates Court were all wrongly decided.
