 The first respondent to the proceedings, Leveraged Capital Pty Ltd ("Leveraged") and the proposed fourth respondent, Opes Prime Stockbroking Ltd ("OPSL") are members of what I will call the Opes Prime Group.
 On the same day, ANZ Banking Group Limited ("ANZ") appointed Receivers and Managers to Leveraged, OPSL and other members of the Opes Prime Group pursuant to fixed and floating charges held by ANZ.
 The Liquidators accepted that it was appropriate for leave to be granted to proceed against Leveraged but that leave should be limited to the "proprietary claims" against Leveraged and the question of liability for damages.
 Fourth, there is some force in the Liquidators' submission that many of the claims made by Altinova against OPSL can sound only in damages and that Altinova seeks to improve its position by agitating the claims as proprietary in nature.
