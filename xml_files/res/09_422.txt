 It lies at the heart of Optus' case that Telstra used Optus' traffic information in the preparation of the market share reports; that that information was Confidential Information for the purposes of the Access Agreement; and that the use of that information in that way, and the use to which the market share reports were themselves put by the management of Telstra, was an impermissible use of that information under the Access Agreement.
 In response to Optus' pleading at [15] of its FCASC that Telstra has used until at least September 2003 the traffic information for purposes which are not permitted purposes pursuant to the Access Agreement, namely, in the preparation of market share reports, Telstra denied these allegations: see [9] of its ADFCASC.
 In response to Optus' pleading at [22] of its FCASC, Telstra said that the market share reports were partly generated from Aggregated Traffic Information which was recorded in NUMIS 100 but denied that information which was used to prepare the market share reports was confidential information for the purposes of the Access Agreement: see [15] of its ADFCASC.
