 THE APPLICANT'S ALLEGATIONS The Applicant carries on the business of what it describes as a " Premium SMS services aggregator ". " SMS " apparently is an abbreviation for " short message service ".
 Reliance is placed by the Applicant upon what are said to be " representations " set forth in this letter and costs thereafter incurred by the Applicant in seeking to address the concerns raised by Telstra.
 Again, a review of the terms of that letter is susceptible of being undertaken on an application for interlocutory relief --- or on an application made pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
