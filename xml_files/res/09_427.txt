 This is an application under section 447A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ( Act ) for an extension of the period fixed by section 439B(2) for the adjournment of a meeting of the South Wagga Sports and Bowling Club Ltd (Administrator Appointed) held pursuant to Part 5.3A of the Act.
 On 14 January 2009, I made an order under section 447A(1) that the period within which the administrator of the company must convene a meeting of creditors under section 439A of the Act be extended up to and including 16 February 2009: see Chamberlain, in the matter of South Wagga Sports and Bowling Ltd (Administrator Appointed) [2009] FCA 25.
 The order which I made on 14 January provided for the meeting to be held during the extended convening period or within five business days of 16 February and the meeting was duly held on 20 February 2009.
 At that meeting, the creditors resolved to adjourn the meeting to 6 March 2009, in view of the matter put before the meeting which indicated that a number of parties had expressed the possibility of the company entering into a deed of company arrangement.
 Mr Chamberlain informed the creditors that a further extension would involve the necessity for an application to the court, and the creditors resolved that Mr Chamberlain should make that application for an extension of the adjournment period to 1 June 2009.
 If the minimum deed fund of $250,000 is provided, Mr Chamberlain estimates that the return to creditors would be approximately 20 to 25 cents in the dollar, whereas if the company is wound up, the estimated return to creditors would be between zero and 10 cents in the dollar.
