 Mr Swinkels says that Bavaria NV began using the Bavaria NV device on its beer sold in Australia in 1995 and that it began exporting beer featuring the trade mark to Australia in 2000.
 The reference to the product as "Bavaria", the prominent word on Bavaria NV's labels (including the trade mark), has been not only by distributors and in advertising but also by Bavaria NV in its own historical material.
 BBA submits that, properly construed, the trade mark is a geographical name against a backdrop of generic heraldic symbols and is incapable of distinguishing Bavaria NV's goods from the goods of other traders.
 Bavaria NV emphasises that there was no evidence that any other trader wishes to use, or would wish to use, the word "Bavaria" in Australia together with heraldic material as in the trade mark.
