 The reference to the product as "Bavaria", the prominent word on Bavaria NV's labels (including the trade mark), has been not only by distributors and in advertising but also by Bavaria NV in its own historical material.
 BBA submits that, properly construed, the trade mark is a geographical name against a backdrop of generic heraldic symbols and is incapable of distinguishing Bavaria NV's goods from the goods of other traders.
