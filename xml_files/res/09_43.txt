 Phisci engaged Opes Prime Paradigm Pty Ltd (OPP), a company that is related to OPS, to act on its behalf in relation to the acquisition of the shares in RBNZ.
 Its primary claim is that it purchased the shares pursuant to a line of credit agreement, the terms of which were partly formed by representations made by OPS, OPP and Green Frog.
 Phisci alleges that OPS, OPP and Green Frog made misleading representations in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth).
 Then there is a non-proprietary claim by which Phisci seeks damages for the misleading conduct under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act or s 12GF of the ASIC Act.
