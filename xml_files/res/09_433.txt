 Initially, in late 2007, it proposed the making of admissions "subject to appropriate qualifications" and the giving of a further undertaking under s 87B of the TP Act rather than for the matter to proceed to Court.
 The letter of offer of 2 May 2008 from solicitors for Harris Scarfe was not one, in my view, which was constructed so as to constitute a reasonable basis for compromising or proposing to settle the proceeding.
 It was a letter which denied any contravention of the TP Act by Harris Scarfe in respect of the television advertisements or the sale catalogue complained of, and asserted that there was a significant risk of the ACCC's claim not succeeding and its claim being dismissed with costs.
