 It further appears that a copy of the agreement signed by Mr Scott Bedford purportedly on behalf of the employees on 13 December 2007 was lodged by Nicole Dempsey by post with the Workplace Authority and, by inference, the Workplace Authority Director.
 The applicant's case is that as a 'person affected by the industrial action' alleged but not 'the employer concerned' (see s 494(7)) , it was entitled to apply for relief under s 494(5) of the Workplace Relations Act in respect of the alleged contravention of s 494(1).
 In the circumstances it was found that all of the persons employed by Karellas in April 2007 whose employment would be subject to the 2007 Agreement, if approved, were not given by Karellas a 'reasonable opportunity to decide' whether they wanted to approve the 2007 Agreement or not.
