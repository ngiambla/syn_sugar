 The GSA provided for the supply by GMA Garnet (as Seller) to Barton International (as Buyer) of garnet from the mine and included responsibilities, which are now disputed, with respect to the branding (or labelling) and the distribution and sale of GMA garnet by Barton International.
 Barton International emphasise that cl 4.2 of the GSA does not confer on GMA Garnet a right to have GMA garnet distributed in North America, nor does it confer on GMA Garnet a right to have GMA garnet promoted in North America.
