 The GSA provided for the supply by GMA Garnet (as Seller) to Barton International (as Buyer) of garnet from the mine and included responsibilities, which are now disputed, with respect to the branding (or labelling) and the distribution and sale of GMA garnet by Barton International.
 What can be said now is that in the course of negotiations Mr Cole was adamant that neither BMC nor Barton International would not undertake the obligations of distributor of GMA garnet supplied under the GSA, and GIRL understood that.
 Barton International emphasise that cl 4.2 of the GSA does not confer on GMA Garnet a right to have GMA garnet distributed in North America, nor does it confer on GMA Garnet a right to have GMA garnet promoted in North America.
