 As I have already observed, a key plank of the respondent's case is that payment at the "ordinary rate" within s 46 means that relevant employees are entitled only to be paid long service leave at the ordinary weekly adult rates of pay specified in cl 5.2.1 of the PSA.
 Even if the "ordinary rate" for such employees is that specified in cl 5.2.1, it is clear that relevant employees engaged under the terms of cl 6.3.3(c) or cl 6.3.3(d) or cl 6.8 are paid "a higher rate than the ordinary rate" for ordinary hours, as contemplated by s 46(2), and that accordingly such employees are entitled to that higher rate for the purposes of long service leave.
