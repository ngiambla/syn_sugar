 The applicant submits that this rate was incorrect --- relevant employees of the respondent should have been paid (and should be paid) for the period of long service leave taken the total amount calculated by the combination of: (a) the appropriate rate of pay contained in cl 5.2.1 of the PSA; and (b) additional amounts contained in cll 6.3.3(c), 6.3.3(d) and/or 6.8 of the PSA, as the case may be.
 Section 43 does not deal with rates of pay. "Ordinary Time Earnings" are defined in cl 1.5.12 of the PSA to mean "the actual ordinary rate of pay the employee receives for the ordinary hours of work performed, excluding overtime, annual leave loadings, shift allowances or other penalty rates, fares and travelling time and other extraneous payments including bonuses and over-award payments".
 As I have already observed, a key plank of the respondent's case is that payment at the "ordinary rate" within s 46 means that relevant employees are entitled only to be paid long service leave at the ordinary weekly adult rates of pay specified in cl 5.2.1 of the PSA.
 Even if the "ordinary rate" for such employees is that specified in cl 5.2.1, it is clear that relevant employees engaged under the terms of cl 6.3.3(c) or cl 6.3.3(d) or cl 6.8 are paid "a higher rate than the ordinary rate" for ordinary hours, as contemplated by s 46(2), and that accordingly such employees are entitled to that higher rate for the purposes of long service leave.
