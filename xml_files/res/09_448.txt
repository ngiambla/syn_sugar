 Mr Harper's claims are as follows: The express representations (1) During discussions between Mr Harper and Mr Hobson in April 2005 Mr Hobson, as agent for Reg-Air, represented that he was "an authorised aircraft engineer" and it would take Reg-Air or Mr Hobson "four months to get [Mr Harper's] aircraft [ONC] into the air" (the express representations).
 Mr Harper denied that Mr Hobson had done so and said that, instead, Mr Hobson had made the statement referred to in Mr Harper's second affidavit (quoted at [27] above).
 The context indicates that the second statement (if made) must have been made some months after Mr Harper moved aircraft ONC into hangar 273 (that is, two to three months after May or June 2005) and thus after the alleged express representations.
