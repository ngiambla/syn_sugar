 Mr Hobson never made the express representations to Mr Harper (other than to the extent that he was, and could have said, he was an aircraft engineer).
 The implied representation The implied representation alleged by Mr Harper depends on Reg-Air and Mr Harper having agreed that it would take Reg-Air four months to have aircraft ONC in the air.
 Mr Harper's case was to the effect that Mr Hobson took the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC and deliberately substituted it with the faulty trim servo motor from aircraft TSO.
