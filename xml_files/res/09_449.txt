 Advice privilege is concerned with direct communications between a lawyer and his client, or their respective agents or employees: Greenough v Gaskell [1833] EngR 333 ; (1833) 1 My K 98; [39 ER 618] ; Anderson v Bank of British Columbia [1876] 2 Ch D 644 , 649.
 They went on to hold (at 688) that unless documents are brought into existence for the sole purpose of submission to legal advisers for advice or for use in legal proceedings, the privilege would not attach.
 First it was contended that the communications were made by MBC not for the dominant purpose of giving legal advice but for the dominant (or equally important) purpose of establishing a solicitor-client relationship with registrants.
