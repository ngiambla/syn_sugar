 Citrus, Mr Tracy and Citrus No. 2 claimed against Sunstate Orchards and Mr Strahley (the respondents in the proceeding) damages for the contended losses suffered in reliance upon the representations.
 Citrus, Mr Tracy and Citrus No. 2 (the appellants) have filed a notice of appeal from the whole of the judgment of the primary judge.
 Mr Tracy has not filed any affidavit that gives content to how he would actually fund the deed and the obligations he has assumed under the deed to fund the costs of the appeal and any consequential proceeding.
 Mr Tracy must then fund Citrus's costs of that action to trial and judgment and satisfy any security for costs orders likely to be made against Citrus.
