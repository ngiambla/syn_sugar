 On 1 April 2009 Graham J made an order in this proceeding granting counsel for the plaintiffs access to documents contained in three numbered packets which had been produced to the Court by the defendant; Ron Medich Properties Pty Ltd v Bentley-Smythe Pty Ltd (No 2) [2009] FCA 334.
 All bank statements, cheque books and cheque butts for the bank accounts BSB 484799 account no 034207092 and BSB 484799 account no 002405415 of the second defendant for the period 1 October 2007 to 28 February 2009.
