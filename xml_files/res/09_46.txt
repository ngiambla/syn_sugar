 Although he recognised that a possibility would have been to file a further appeal immediately, in circumstances where that may be unnecessary because the first appeal may not be struck out, it appeared to be a waste of money.
 According to the applicants, Mr Mitry's explanation of the delay in filing the notice of appeal after the final orders of the Federal Magistrates Court of 22 July 2008, in short, were not as unsatisfactory as Moore J appears to have concluded.
 It therefore followed that if the decision to cease trading was unrelated to injury to the respondent, the respondent cannot have been terminated for the prohibited reason identified in s 659(2)(a) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth).
