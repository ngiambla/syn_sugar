 The nature and history of the proceeding This proceeding concerns the proper construction of a provision in an undertaking, given by the first applicant, Toll Holdings Ltd ("Toll Holdings"), to the respondent, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the ACCC").
 Under its standard terms and conditions, Toll Personnel was responsible for the payment of salaries, taxation, superannuation and workers' compensation insurance for those employed by it as casual employees for the purpose of providing labour hire services to its clients.
 It follows that, on the ordinary meaning of the words "share" and "second", the provision of labour services of its employees by Toll Personnel to Asciano amounted both to sharing employees between Toll Personnel and to seconding employees from Toll Personnel to Asciano.
