 On reading that affidavit it appears to me (and the Minister's legal representative did not disagree with this proposition) that the applicant, in fact, seeks to challenge the decision of the Minister to cancel his visa.
 The applicant's affidavit and some short written submissions filed in Court by the applicant suggest that the Minister's decision to cancel the visa was affected by jurisdictional error in that the Minister did not give primary weight to the best interests of the applicant's two children.
 In this regard, I give weight to the fact that the applicant has appeared in Court today unrepresented (although the application, the affidavit and the applicant's submissions seem to disclose the hand of someone perhaps with some legal training or otherwise familiar with the statutory regime).
