 On 14 December 2007, the Farinhas were ordered to file and serve an affidavit that disclosed relevant financial information with respect to Bondi Junction, Piccolo and World Square for the years ended 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2007.
 The letter did not dispute that the plaintiffs would be entitled to a reasonable amount in respect of the costs they had incurred up to that stage, taking into account the factors that were outlined in the letter.
 In particular, the letter asserted that the commencement of the proceeding by interlocutory process was unnecessary and could have been avoided and that the costs of the proceeding had been unnecessarily increased by the way in which the plaintiffs were conducting the litigation.
 Further, if both parties act reasonably in commencing and defending a proceeding, and the proceeding is ultimately resolved by settlement, it is appropriate that there be no order as to the costs of the proceeding.
