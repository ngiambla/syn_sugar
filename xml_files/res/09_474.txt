 The applicant submits that pursuant to ss 13(1) and 15AB (2)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), both the heading of the Division as well as the heading of the section can be considered when construing the operation of s 261A.
 The applicant refers to extrinsic material, being the Second Reading speech of the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 (Cth) ('the Border Protection Bill '), in which the Immigration Minister referred to the forfeiture and disposal of ships and aircraft ' used in people smuggling operations '.
 This Court, as stated at [33] of this judgment, finds that the word 'contravention' in s 261A means contravention of the Migration Act generally and not only of the offence provisions, and that contravention is not to be interpreted as being confined to conviction for an offence.
 As was stated at [30]-[31] of Tran No. 1 , following the decision of French J in Olbers , for the automatic forfeiture to arise the Court ' must be satisfied to a high degree of probability ' that contraventions of the Migration Act exist.
