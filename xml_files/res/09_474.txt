 The applicant submits that pursuant to ss 13(1) and 15AB (2)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), both the heading of the Division as well as the heading of the section can be considered when construing the operation of s 261A.
 This Court, as stated at [33] of this judgment, finds that the word 'contravention' in s 261A means contravention of the Migration Act generally and not only of the offence provisions, and that contravention is not to be interpreted as being confined to conviction for an offence.
