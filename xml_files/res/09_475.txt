 The Tribunal recorded (at [150]) that in relation to Sisterella "the items of correspondence" on which ASIC relied were: The Tribunal noted that in his oral evidence, Mr Gould said that he did not have any separate company letterhead made up, and that he corresponded in relation to each company on his own letterhead.
 The proceeding before the Tribunal was a new and independent proceeding in which the Tribunal was required, for the protection of the public, to arrive at the correct or preferred decision on the evidence before it.
 In relation to Contention 2.1, the Notice of Contention asserts that the Tribunal erred in "finding that the resolution of [Trinbay] appointing [Mr Gould] as voluntary administrator could and did operate on a prospective or nunc pro tunc basis".
