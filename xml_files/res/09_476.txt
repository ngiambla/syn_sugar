 The application for winding up is made on the basis of a failure on the part of WPS Motorsport to comply with the terms of a statutory demand and its consequential deemed insolvency.
 If I am satisfied that it is in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration then I am obliged, as I have said, by s 440A(2) to adjourn the winding up application.
 The relevant consideration under that subsection is, as the subsection states, is it in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up?
 Nonetheless, the public interest is a relevant consideration in the event that I were not satisfied that it was in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up.
