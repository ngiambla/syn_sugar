 One of the judgments delivered by the primary judge on that day, Luck v University of Southern Queensland (No. 2) [2008] FCA 1594 , considered an application made by Ms Luck that the primary judge should disqualify himself from hearing the matter which was before him in proceeding VID 476 of 2008.
 The other judgment given on the same day, namely 22 October 2008, was the primary judge's judgment in Luck v University of Southern Queensland [2008] FCA 1582 , in which his Honour refused an application for adjournment of the hearing of VID 476 of 2008 and ordered that an appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which was then before his Honour, be dismissed with costs.
 On 1 May 2009, Ms Luck filed a Notice of Motion in the appeal in this matter in which she sought the disqualification of various judges, including Moore, Rares, Tracey and Bennett JJ, although the only relevant part of that Notice of Motion was contained in paragraph 2 in which she sought an order in relation to disqualification of Rares J.
