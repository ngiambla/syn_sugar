 That is, at least to the extent that the respondent's claim was based on the Clerks NAPSA (the federal instrument), there is exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Court to deal with that part of any appeal.
 The appellant submitted that approximately 80% of the respondent's claim (both in terms of the period covered and the amount recoverable) was derived from the Clerks Award whereas only approximately 20% of the claim is derived from the Clerks NAPSA.
 The question remains whether the reasons of the Industrial Magistrate constitute a determination, binding upon the parties and determinative of their legal rights, notwithstanding that there is no formal or separate sealed order recording such a determination.
 In the alternative, the respondent submitted that the appellant should pay the costs of and incidental to the stay motion under s 824(2) WR Act, because those costs had been incurred by an unreasonable act or omission in connection with the appeal.
