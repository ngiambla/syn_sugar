 The appellant submitted that approximately 80% of the respondent's claim (both in terms of the period covered and the amount recoverable) was derived from the Clerks Award whereas only approximately 20% of the claim is derived from the Clerks NAPSA.
 In the alternative, the respondent submitted that the appellant should pay the costs of and incidental to the stay motion under s 824(2) WR Act, because those costs had been incurred by an unreasonable act or omission in connection with the appeal.
