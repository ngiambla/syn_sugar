 The Commissioner identified a number of occasions when, before the appeal was commenced, the taxpayer had an opportunity to disclose the underlying facts and circumstances relating to the loss incurred in the development and sale of the property.
 During that period, an officer of the Australian Taxation Office, by a letter dated 14 September 2006, wrote to the taxpayer and requested that the taxpayer provide "the workings on the capital gain or loss on the sale of the property including documentary evidence for the relevant transaction".
 Mr Romano, who appears for the taxpayer, said that that the taxpayer's conduct prior to the commencement of the proceeding was not relevant in the costs context because this was a tax case.
 In my view, the evidence does not sufficiently explain why the information and documentation was not provided to the Australian Taxation Office, either during the audit process or subsequently whilst the taxpayer's objection was under consideration by the Australian Taxation Office.
