 The Tribunal is of the view that the lack of claims in the protection visa application and before the Tribunal supports a finding that the applicant was not in fear of persecution, as now claimed. ...
 The Minister had there contended that if s 91R(3) were: ... interpreted in the manner contended for by the Appellants it would require the [Tribunal] to disregard any steps that the applicant took in Australia to make a claim for refugee protection.
 Contrary to the conclusion of the Federal Magistrate, and assuming that s 91R(3) was engaged by reference to the 1999 application and the 2000 request for Ministerial intervention, it is further considered that the Tribunal did reach the requisite state of satisfaction as required by s 91R(3).
 The letter cannot be read as anything other than an invitation to comment or respond to the concern of the Tribunal that the claim of the now Appellant to be a refugee because he feared persecution was a claim that could not be believed.
