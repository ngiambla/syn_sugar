 SECTION 355(A) AND SECTION 355(AA) Section 355(a) requires a petition to " set out the facts relied on " and s 355(aa) further provides that (subject to s 358(2)) those facts are to be set out " with sufficient particularity to identify the specific matter or matters on which the petitioner relies ... ".
 These two requirements are directed to two different objectives --- one objective is to require a petitioner to " set out the facts relied on "; the other objective is to ensure that from those facts " the specific matter or matters on which the petitioner relies " may be identified " with sufficient particularity ".
 Despite that " obscurity ", it is " clear from s 358(1) that no proceedings may be had on the petition unless it sets out the facts relied on to invalidate the election ": McClure v Australian Electoral Commission [1999] HCA 31 at [23] , [1999] HCA 31 ; 163 ALR 734 at 739 per Hayne J.
 Given the manner in which the " Statement of Facts " in the petition has been expressed, it is perhaps not surprising that there is some divergence between the submissions of both the Corporation and the Commission as to the identification of those " facts ".
