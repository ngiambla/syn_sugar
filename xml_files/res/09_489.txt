 At the time of the application, there was in existence a proceeding in the Supreme Court of Victoria that related directly to the activities of Australvic.
 The liquidator does not seek the removal of the restriction on the use of Mr Mason's evidence because there is now no proceeding in which the evidence could be used.
 In those reasons I said it was clear that the liquidator was not seeking to conduct a dress rehearsal of a possible cross-examination of Mr Mason, who at that time was a potential witness in the Supreme Court proceeding.
