 The Tribunal accepted the Authority's contentions in the following terms: I conclude that Mr Fawcett and the Company failed in the duty imposed upon each of them with respect to a matter affecting the safe operation of an aircraft, that is the Cirrus aircraft (CAR 269(c)).
 However, the Authority had also contended that neither Mr Fawcett nor Central were fit and proper persons to hold a certificate of approval or licence so that the discretionary power to vary, suspend or cancel them also arose by reason of reg 269(1)(d).
 On the other hand, it found that Mr Fawcett and Central were fit and proper "to have the responsibilities and exercise and perform the functions and duties of a holder of a licence and a certificate of approval respectively" (at [127]).
