 The applicant also seeks an order requiring the respondent to change its name with a view to removing any possibility that the use of the respondent's current name might mislead or deceive members of the public and might also constitute passing off.
 In fulfilment of that claim, I propose to make the following order, namely that: Within 14 days of the date of the making of this order, the respondent is to do all things necessary to effect a change of its name to a name which does not include the words "Sumitomo" or "Mitsui" or any combination of those words.
 Doing the best I can and appreciating that the assessment which I am about to make is rather broad, but taking into account my detailed knowledge of the matter and the work that was done in order to bring the proceedings forward, I propose to order that the respondent pay the costs of the applicant of and incidental to these proceedings, including reserved costs assessed at the amount of $40,000.
