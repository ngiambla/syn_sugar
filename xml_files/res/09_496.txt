 The applicant also seeks an order requiring the respondent to change its name with a view to removing any possibility that the use of the respondent's current name might mislead or deceive members of the public and might also constitute passing off.
 In fulfilment of that claim, I propose to make the following order, namely that: Within 14 days of the date of the making of this order, the respondent is to do all things necessary to effect a change of its name to a name which does not include the words "Sumitomo" or "Mitsui" or any combination of those words.
 That rule is in the following terms: Substituted performance (1) Where a judgment or order requires the person bound to do an act and the person bound does not do the act, the Court may: (a) direct that the act be done by a person appointed by the Court; and (b) order the person bound to pay the costs incurred pursuant to the direction. (2) Subrule (1) does not affect any other mode of enforcement of the judgment or order, or the powers of the Court to punish for contempt.
 Doing the best I can and appreciating that the assessment which I am about to make is rather broad, but taking into account my detailed knowledge of the matter and the work that was done in order to bring the proceedings forward, I propose to order that the respondent pay the costs of the applicant of and incidental to these proceedings, including reserved costs assessed at the amount of $40,000.
