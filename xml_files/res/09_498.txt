 In summary, the applicants' argument is: Notwithstanding these submissions, I do not accept that the power of the Court to make orders as to non-party costs in these proceedings has been exhausted simply because costs orders have already been made and entered against the applicants.
 LIABILITY OF MRS TRACY FOR NON-PARTY COSTS Submissions of the parties I turn now to the key issue in this case, namely whether Mrs Tracy is liable for non-party costs in respect of the costs of the first and second respondents in the primary proceedings.
 That is not to say, of course, that non-party costs will not be awarded against a spouse or other family member should the circumstances warrant --- for example Thistleton v Hendricks (1992) 32 Con LR 123 , Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd [1999] 20 LS GazR 39.
 Second, while I note that the proceedings were actually initiated by Janling Pty Ltd following the purported assignment of the causes of action, I also note that costs were awarded to the first and second respondents after the applicants were substituted for Janling Pty Ltd by consent on 15 February 2006.
