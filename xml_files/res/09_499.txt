 The representative with which Adnunat corresponded was a Mr Bob Connell, who was at the same time both the General Manager of Reid and Marketing Manager of ITW, then named Ramset Fasteners (Aust) Pty Ltd.
 Second, by its letter dated 1 March 2005, ITW notifed Adnunat that Reid's business had been transferred to it, that the change reflected "only a change in the legal ownership of the Reid business", that ITW would thereafter be conducting the business under Reid's existing trading name, Reid Construction Systems, and Adnunat was to deal with ITW instead.
 Applying that result to this case, Adnunat contended that the necessary consent as between ITW and Adnunat should be found given the existence of the enurement clause and ITW's conduct in accepting both the benefit and burden of the Settlement Deed.
