 In the further amended statement of claim, the applicants say that on 24 March 2004 the Principal's representative under the Willowdene Head Contract, for and on behalf of the first respondent, issued to Willowdene a notice purportedly given under clause 16 of that contract prohibiting Willowdene from using the second applicant in the performance of any works under that contract.
 The applicants also plead, in effect, that nobody informed them about, or provided them with any opportunity to respond to, allegations relating to alleged misconduct of a Departmental employee, and a pending investigation by the Department into any alleged association of the applicants with a Department employee.
 Finally, the applicants plead that the opinion held and expressed by the Principal's representative for and on behalf of the corporation on 24 March 2004, namely, that the second applicant was an unsuitable contractor, was unreasonable.
 The reference in the pleadings to the opinion held and expressed on 24 March 2004 is to the notice given by the first respondent to Willowdene under clause 16 of the general conditions of contract.
