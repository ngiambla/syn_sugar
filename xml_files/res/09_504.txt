 The conditions that the Tribunal concluded could be considered ailments within the meaning of s 4 of the SRC Act that are relevant to these proceedings relate to Mr Mellor's kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine, degenerative change in the lumbar spine and a congenital anomaly at the lumbosacral junction (at [223]-[224]).
 Mr Mellor raises issues which, in turn, he relies upon as questions of law for an appeal under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act') and as errors of law for the purposes of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('the ADJR Act').
 The questions of law, as framed in the notice of appeal and at the hearing, are: (i) Did the Tribunal err at law in: (a) Having found that [Mr Mellor's] lower back injury was aggravated by work, not finding [that Mr Mellor] suffered an injury for the purposes of s 4 of the Act; (b) Having found that [Mr Mellor's] thoracic back injury was aggravated by work, not finding [that Mr Mellor] suffered an injury for the purposes of s 4 of the Act; (c) Determining that a material change to the pathology in [Mr Mellor's] back was required to found injury for the purposes of s 4 of the Act; These same questions form the grounds of review under the ADJR Act.
