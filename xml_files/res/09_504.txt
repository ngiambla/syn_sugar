 Accordingly, the Tribunal did not fail to appreciate that: an aggravation of an existing ailment may constitute an injury; that an aggravation can be a compensable injury without any change in the pathology of the ailment; or that pain can constitute a compensable injury.
 The Tribunal's conclusions on aggravation and materiality In the case of each of Mr Mellor's thoracic kyphoscoliosis and lumbar spine, the Tribunal concluded that the requirement of materiality was not satisfied.
 This was because the Tribunal did not accept that a temporary increase in symptoms represented an aggravation of the thoracic spine condition in a material degree and found that the temporary aggravation of the lumbar spine condition meant that the contribution to the lower back condition was not sufficiently significant to meet the threshold of "in a material degree".
