 For these reasons the omission of the words "substantially continuously" in claim 1 of the specification for application 855 does not place the invention therein disclosed outside the scope of the claims of the accepted specification for application 364.
 Memcor said that the alternative approach of Dr Baker (in which claim 1 of the accepted specification for application 364 includes an embodiment of the invention in which the open ends of the fibers are flush with the permeate-discharging face) was thus incorrect.
 GE (and Dr Baker) observed that the phrase "extending from" could be contrasted with that of fibers which "protrude through a permeate-discharging face" as referred to in claim 4 of the accepted specification for application 364.
 Accordingly, the reference to the "permeate collection means to collect said permeate sealingly connected in open fluid communication with the or each permeate discharging face" in the specification for application 855 is within the scope of claim 1 of the accepted specification for application 364.
