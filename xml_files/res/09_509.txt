 Tramanco Pty Ltd (Tramanco), has today instituted proceedings against BPW Transpec Pty Ltd (BPW Transpec) for injunctive relief and ancillary orders, as well as either damages or an account of profits in respect of an alleged infringement of its patent, Australian Patent Number 2004264997 (the patent).
 That is the day upon which the docket judge will be able to hear an application for the renewal or dissolving of the injunction, and to give directions in respect of the further conduct of the proceeding.
 Equally, I am not persuaded that an injunction which would, even for the short term, require BPW Transpec to make a value judgment about whether it was infringing claims 1, 12, 19, 21, 22 and 23 in terms of para 1(b) of a draft provided to me ought to go.
