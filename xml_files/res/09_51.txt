 Having regard to the Amended Reply, relevant parts of Mr Roberts' affidavit and the applicants' counsel's statement of the applicants' case today, I am not persuaded that the proposed interrogatories are relevant to any material fact in dispute.
 I do not recall the date, and have no written record or any other way of identifying the date, on which I, or any other person employed by Porter Davis, first became aware that Metricon was offering for sale the First Respondent's Houses.
