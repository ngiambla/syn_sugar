 The issue of the Notice and accompanying Explanatory Memorandum on 18 February 2009 was preceded by a meeting of the board of directors of Aurium on 17 February 2009 at the offices of the company at 35 Great Eastern Highway, Rivervale, Western Australia.
 The important point to note here is that an assessment of the materiality of a personal interest is not made in some generalised way, but in relation to "the matter that relates to the affairs of the company", or as Murray J put it at 304, "to the matter under consideration or the contract or arrangement which is proposed".
