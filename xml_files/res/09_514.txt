 It is common ground that as of 29 January 2008, Mr Deng advised Mr Tay that the plaintiffs were not prepared to provide interim funding and would not provide guarantees for the proposed St George Bank Ltd loan.
 GAS and Mr Tay oppose any such orders, deny they acted unreasonably and say that the parties to the proceedings should bear their own costs following the making of the consent order for discontinuance of the winding up application.
 Mr Tay and GAS deny that they effectively surrendered to the plaintiffs on the application and insist that the consent order in these proceedings was as a result of the change of circumstances mentioned in para 19 of Mr Tay's costs affidavit.
