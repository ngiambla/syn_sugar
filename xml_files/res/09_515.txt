 The claim made in the proceeding is said by the applicant to be within the original jurisdiction of the Court, "being an application for a declaration as to the proper construction of s 494C of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)".
 Giving by hand (2) If the Minister gives a document to a person by the method in subsection 494B(2) (which involves handing the document to the person), the person is taken to have received the document when it is handed to the person.
 The Court held that the effect of the section was to identify the date of receipt of a document and that it was not open to a person to establish that in fact he received the document on another date.
 The relief sought should be refused in any event because an adequate alternative remedy is available, being a review by the first respondent, the Migration Review Tribunal, and, if appropriate, an application for constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal.
