 The claim made in the proceeding is said by the applicant to be within the original jurisdiction of the Court, "being an application for a declaration as to the proper construction of s 494C of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)".
 The legislative basis for the Court's jurisdiction to hear the application and grant the relief sought is said by the applicant to be s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ("the Judiciary Act ") and s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ("the Federal Court Act").
 The only substantive relief which the applicant seeks is a declaration in the following terms: "A declaration that subs 494C(5) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) creates a rebuttable statutory presumption of the existence of the fact that, on 22 September 2008, the Applicant received notice of a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a Class VC Subclass 485 Skilled (Provisional) Graduate visa. " Under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ("the Act"), the Minister is required or permitted by various sections in the Act to give a document to a person, and may be required to give the document to the person by one of the methods in s 494B.
