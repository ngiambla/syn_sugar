 THE SETTLEMENT The terms of settlement provide that the parties to the agreement are the applicants in each proceeding, the respondents and the group members referred to in each of the proceedings.
 The group members were informed of all of the terms of the settlement; they were also informed of the consequences of a decision by any of them not to accept the settlement.
 Group members were informed in the letter of 14 April that the Court would be likely to hear an application for approval of the settlement on 28 April 2009.
 The letter observed in [26] that the solicitors for the respondents have expressed a view that the settlement agreement reached on 27 March 2009 prevents group members from opting out.
