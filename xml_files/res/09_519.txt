 On 24 November 2006, each defendant entered into an employment contract with Lodge which provided that in certain circumstances Lodge would pay him an "Introduction Fee" in respect of new clients introduced by him to Lodge.
 The circumstance relevant to the present case is that the Court is satisfied that there is a genuine dispute between the company and the defendants about the existence of the debt to which the demand relates.
 The Court referred to issues as to the admissibility of post-contract conduct of the parties and the question whether the heads of agreement represented a concluded contract at all.
 Thirdly, he submits that the percentage payable is to be determined at Lodge's discretion and that Lodge should be taken to have exercised its discretion against paying any percentage in respect of the second tranche.
