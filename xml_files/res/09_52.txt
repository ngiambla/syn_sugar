 Accordingly, I find that Mr Mates, in his own right, and the Union, through Mr Mates' conduct on 17 February 2006, breached s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act .
 Mr Cahill also alleged that, on 21 February 2006, Mr Mates telephoned the office of Independent Cranes and said that its crew were not to work on the Mount Street project.
 Mr Cahill further alleged that, around the same time as Mr Mates shut down the crane, Mr Mates telephoned the Union's offices or a representative of the Union (whose identity is unknown) to instruct Mr Hill (the Union organiser responsible for crane services in Victoria (FEDFA Division)) that he should ring Sergi Cranes and other crane operators to warn them off working at the Mount Street site.
