 An employer may make an agreement (a union collective agreement ) in writing with one or more organisations of employees if, when the agreement is made, each organisation: (a) has at least one member whose employment in a single business (or part of a single business) of the employer will be subject to the agreement; and (b) is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the member in relation to work that will be subject to the agreement. ...
 Application of the law to the facts Whilst the legislature's intention was to have collective agreements, whether employee collective agreements or union collective agreements, cover 'a single business or part of a single business', that was clearly to be the case 'unless' one of the 'exceptions' covered by s 322(2) applied (see Explanatory Memorandum paragraphs 790, 793 and 794).
 More importantly, it is clear from paragraph 793 that '95A(2)(b)(ii)' was in contemplation when the paragraph was drafted (see 'and the single businesses may be treated as one single business') and that the omission of 'each' was inadvertent, otherwise the reference to 'single business es ' (emphasis added) being treated as 'one single business' would be otiose.
 The employer companies within the VersaCold group were not obliged by s 328(a) or any of the other provisions of the Act to have separate union collective agreements for parts of the single businesses which, by virtue of s 322(2)(b)(ii) were to be treated as 'one single business', such as geographically distinct parts like Minto, Girraween, Arndell Park or, as the applicant would seek, Eastern Creek.
