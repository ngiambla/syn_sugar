 The Tribunal found that the appellant is not a "refugee" within the meaning of Art 1A of the Convention and therefore is not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations.
 His Honour found that the Tribunal had dealt with and assessed all of the claims, evidence and information in an orderly and coherent way and the appellant had not pointed to any information which the Tribunal failed to consider.
