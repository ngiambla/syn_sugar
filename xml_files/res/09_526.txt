 The Tribunal found that the appellant is not a "refugee" within the meaning of Art 1A of the Convention and therefore is not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations.
 His Honour held that the Tribunal had considered all of the appellant's claims and the evidence put to it, and gave the appellant an opportunity to comment on information which the Tribunal considered relevant.
 His Honour found that the Tribunal had dealt with and assessed all of the claims, evidence and information in an orderly and coherent way and the appellant had not pointed to any information which the Tribunal failed to consider.
 In any event, the Federal Magistrate has pointed out that the Refugee Review Tribunal had before it a variety of information and that appellant had the opportunity to make written and oral representations to it, which he did.
