 Equally, a decision to set aside the decision under review and remit the matter for reconsideration pursuant to s 43(1)(c)(ii) requires the original repository of the powers and discretions to exercise them afresh: they are not exercised by the Tribunal.
 In SZANI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1298 at [25] Tamberlin J said that a failure by the Refugee Review Tribunal in its reasons to refer to, consider, or give reasons for rejection of documents which were strongly corroborative of an applicant's claim constituted a jurisdictional error.
 Since I have found that the tribunal ignored and thus, failed to have regard to the strongly corroborative and relevant material in the daughter's 2001 interview and 2007 letter, I am satisfied that it committed a jurisdictional error: Craig 184 CLR at 179.
 I discussed the principles applicable to a statutory duty of, or requirement for, a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to factors in Telstra Corporation Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2008] FCA 1758 at [103] - [112] .
