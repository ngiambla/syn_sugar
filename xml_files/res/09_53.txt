 PRELIMINARY MATTERS As I indicated in both Kowalski (No 1) and Kowalski (No 2) , the actual dispute between Mr Kowalski and MMAL has a long history dating to before 16 March 1994 when his employment with that company ceased.
 The following day Mr Kowalski wrote to the Trustee attaching documents to prove that the Trustee was not a party to the mediation and settlement agreement and that he was not in 1998 paid his correct entitlement according to law.
