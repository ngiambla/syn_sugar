 PRELIMINARY MATTERS As I indicated in both Kowalski (No 1) and Kowalski (No 2) , the actual dispute between Mr Kowalski and MMAL has a long history dating to before 16 March 1994 when his employment with that company ceased.
 Mr Kowalski made a claim for Total and Permanent ("TPD") benefit on 20 February, 1992 claiming that the Life Insured had been absent from employment since 16 August, 1991 as a result of emotional stress and pathologically intense state of anxiety and that he was TPD.
 The following day Mr Kowalski wrote to the Trustee attaching documents to prove that the Trustee was not a party to the mediation and settlement agreement and that he was not in 1998 paid his correct entitlement according to law.
