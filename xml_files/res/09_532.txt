 The evidence before me today from a solicitor for the administrators, Ms Markovic, is that on or about 23 October 2007, the company notified insurer A of the council's claim and other claims and circumstances which had the potential to give rise to claims.
 The report to creditors also identified that the company had notified claims and circumstances to insurer B, a United States company, and cover was provided by that insurer under a global arrangement put in place by a related Lehman Brothers company to cover its worldwide operations.
 The report said that there were a number of complex legal issues and commercial considerations that must be considered in pursuing any claim for indemnity from insurer B, and that it was not presently known whether or not the limits of indemnity for that cover were exhausted by claims made in the United States and or elsewhere against the policy holder for its global operations.
 In her affidavit filed today, Ms Markovic, the solicitor for the company has said that it notified insurer B of the council's claim and other claims and circumstances on about 5 November 2007, and insurer B had been provided with copies of documentation relevant to the council's claim.
 One of those terms was that releases were to be given by creditors to Lehman Brothers (the respondent in these proceedings), the directors, company officers and employees of Lehman Brothers, and its affiliated and associated companies, including subsidiaries and Lehman Brothers Asia Holdings.
 In other words, one of the proposals of the deed of company arrangement put forward by a related company of Lehman Brothers was that all claims would be released that might otherwise have been able to be made by creditors, such as the council, against Lehman Brothers, its related companies and the directors and officers of Lehman Brothers themselves.
 Secondly, Lehman Brothers argues that the provisions of Pt 5.3A of the Act themselves identify a legislative choice made by the Parliament, in the interests of the efficient and timeous conduct of administrations, about the kind of information that creditors are entitled to receive.
 Secondly, Lehman Brothers argued that the Parliament has provided a creditor, whose position may have been prejudiced by a vote to enter into a deed of company arrangement, with a right of action under s 445D to have the Court terminate that deed.
 The administrator must also provide a statement setting out his or her opinion about whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the company to execute a deed of company arrangement, for the administration to end, or for the company to go into liquidation.
 Further bases for termination of a deed under s 445D(1) is that effect could not be given to the deed without injustice or undue delay, or that, in substance, the deed or one of its provisions or an act or omission done or made under it, or proposed to be done or made, was oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, one or more creditors, or contrary to the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole, or for some other reason (see s 445D(1) , (d), (e), (f) and (g)).
 The council's ability to use the information in the documents to be produced extends to include, in my view, informing itself as to how it ought approach voting on any proposals for a deed of company arrangement, or liquidation, of Lehman Brothers, since those matters affect its entitlement to enforce, or may affect its entitlement to enforce, any judgment and the quantification of that judgment.
