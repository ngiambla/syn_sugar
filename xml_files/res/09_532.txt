 The evidence before me today from a solicitor for the administrators, Ms Markovic, is that on or about 23 October 2007, the company notified insurer A of the council's claim and other claims and circumstances which had the potential to give rise to claims.
 The report to creditors also identified that the company had notified claims and circumstances to insurer B, a United States company, and cover was provided by that insurer under a global arrangement put in place by a related Lehman Brothers company to cover its worldwide operations.
 One of those terms was that releases were to be given by creditors to Lehman Brothers (the respondent in these proceedings), the directors, company officers and employees of Lehman Brothers, and its affiliated and associated companies, including subsidiaries and Lehman Brothers Asia Holdings.
 The administrator must also provide a statement setting out his or her opinion about whether it would be in the creditors' interests for the company to execute a deed of company arrangement, for the administration to end, or for the company to go into liquidation.
