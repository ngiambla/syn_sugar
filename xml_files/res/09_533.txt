 Affidavits from the following persons were also read: Mr Simon Blackshield, a legal representative employed by SWALSC, deposing to the steps taken to give notice of the 1 December 2007 meeting and the proceedings at the meeting; Ms Jo-Anne Jones, a legal assistant employed by SWALSC, also deposing to steps taken to give notice of the meeting; and Ms Yvette Bradley, an anthropologist, deposing to the steps taken to identify those persons who qualified as a member of the Wagyl Kaip native title claim group before, and at the 1 December 2007 meeting.
 Of the 72 who attended, 29 opposed the resolution to revoke the authorisation of the current Wagyl Kaip applicant, and to appoint the proposed replacement applicant. 29 The respondents contended that the resolution passed at the 1 December 2007 meeting was not effective to revoke the authorisation of the current Wagyl Kaip applicant and to authorise the proposed replacement applicant.
 In the circumstances, said the respondents, the meeting could not properly be described as a claim group meeting for the purposes of s 66B of the Act. 30 Further, said the respondents, none of them had ever exceeded their authority and they did not consent to be removed as members of the Wagyl Kaip applicant.
