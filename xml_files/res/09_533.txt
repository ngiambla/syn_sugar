 Of the 72 who attended, 29 opposed the resolution to revoke the authorisation of the current Wagyl Kaip applicant, and to appoint the proposed replacement applicant. 29 The respondents contended that the resolution passed at the 1 December 2007 meeting was not effective to revoke the authorisation of the current Wagyl Kaip applicant and to authorise the proposed replacement applicant.
 In the circumstances, said the respondents, the meeting could not properly be described as a claim group meeting for the purposes of s 66B of the Act. 30 Further, said the respondents, none of them had ever exceeded their authority and they did not consent to be removed as members of the Wagyl Kaip applicant.
