 The appellants submitted that the Tribunal considered the appellants' father to be their representative, yet he was not appointed by them as their representative and was therefore not able to lawfully represent them before the Tribunal.
 The appellants alleged that the evidence provided by the appellants' father was not information provided by the appellants and accordingly was not excluded from the requirements of s 424A(1) of the Act by s 424A(3)(b).
 The Tribunal decision records the appellants' claim that 'they [the appellants] were born in Australia, they are not familiar with Bangladesh, its language and culture and...they will be unable to settle there' .
