 THE APPLICANT'S CLAIM The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) seeks declaratory and other orders under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TP Act) in relation to conduct of Harris Scarfe Australia Pty Ltd (Harris Scarfe) which took place in October 2006.
 I therefore conclude that, at least in respect of those two televisions as depicted, that the sale catalogue made the 15% Off Home Entertainment Representation, and that it contravened both s 52 and s 53(e) of the TP Act.
 I further find that, in respect of the five items listed in [20] above, that representation was misleading and deceptive contrary to s 52 of the TP Act and was false and misleading as to the price of those items contrary to s 53(e) of the TP Act.
 It follows that I am not satisfied that, by the television commercial, Harris Scarfe made the Storewide Discount Representation or the 20% Off Storewide Representation as alleged by the ACCC.
