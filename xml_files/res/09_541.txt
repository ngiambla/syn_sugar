 The applicant seeks leave to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 6 February 2009 ( SZHLW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Anor [2009] FMCA 51).
 The application is accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the applicant on 12 February 2009, as well as a draft notice of appeal also filed on 12 February 2009.
 I am further satisfied that there should be an order for costs in the first respondent's favour and that the amount of $1,550 is an appropriate amount having regard to the matters set out in the affidavit of Rohan White of Sparke Helmore, solicitors for the first respondent, sworn 15 May 2009.
