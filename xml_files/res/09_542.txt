 The applicants seek leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Marshall J given on 9 April 2009: see Jemena Asset Management (3) Pty Ltd v Coinvest Limited [2009] FCA 327.
 Those questions related to the alleged inconsistency between various federal industrial instruments to which the applicants are party on the one hand and the Construction Industry Long Service Leave Act 1997 (Vic) on the other.
 It is sufficient for present purposes to observe that the draft notice of appeal raises substantial issues relating to the interrelationship of the federal instruments and the State Act, and whether inconsistency in the constitutional sense arises between them.
