 The Tribunal has rejected the applicant's claims of being a leader or a high level member of the BNP and does not accept that he had a significant political profile in his locality, district or at any other level.
 The appellant contended that by his response of 17 January 2008 [mistakenly dated 17 January 2007], he "squarely" put to the Tribunal that the caretaker government in Bangladesh is "particularly severe" on those people the government considered to have been involved in agitating against it in other countries.
 The appellant contended that notwithstanding the Tribunal's adverse findings as to credit, the Tribunal nevertheless accepted that the appellant was a "low level member" of the BNP in Bangladesh and had been assaulted on two occasions in the 1990s.
