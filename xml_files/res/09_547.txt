 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 19 March 2009 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal.
 When the matter came before it, the Tribunal held that it had no jurisdiction to reconsider Mr Bagwe's application because, at the date of lodging his application with it on 10 July 2008, Mr Bagwe had no approved sponsor, and there was, therefore, no MRT-reviewable decision for the purposes of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 Accordingly, whilst the challenged decision satisfied s 338(2)(a), (b) and (c), the challenged decision did not satisfy s 338(2)(d) and, accordingly, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to review the decision.
