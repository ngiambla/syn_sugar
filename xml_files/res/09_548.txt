 It is inappropriate to take account of conduct of the first defendant through various Branches, Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in question and are contraventions of different legislation.
 In the present case, the applicant invites the Court to have regard to previous contraventions by the CFMEU of the WR Act in determining the appropriate penalty for the CFMEU's contraventions of the BCII Act.
 In the present case, the prior contraventions on which the applicant relies are those of ss 38 and 43 of the BCII Act, and of ss 170NC, 298P(3) and 187AB of the WR Act (as those provisions were numbered at the relevant times).
