 The transcript reveals that the appellant made the statement " [m]y father received a warning from the police and he was arrested in the name of disturbing the peace" however she neither attributes this to 2001 or 2004 .
 The Member immediately sought clarification and the appellant confirmed that the she did not say now or previously, that her father had been detained or arrested in 2004 .
 It was also submitted by the appellant that the Tribunal failed to give appropriate weight to the consideration that the appellant was a minor at all times in China and at all material times in Australia.
 The Tribunal found that the appellant had sufficient maturity to prosecute her case - a finding which was open to the Tribunal on the evidence and material before it and for the reasons it gave.
