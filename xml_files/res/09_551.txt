 On 1 May 2009, I dismissed a Notice of Motion which had been filed by the respondents on 16 April 2009, which sought orders that certain paragraphs of the Statement of Claim be struck out pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules .
 For the purposes of deciding a strike-out motion, or whether the pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action, the Court is obliged to assume the truth of the allegations in the Statement of Claim, and draw all inferences favourable to the party against whom the strike-out motion is brought.
 If the Responding Recipient does not pay the invoice, after several subsequent reminder notices Australialink sends a letter of demand purporting to be from a commercial collection agency. 5.9 If the Responding Recipient does not comply with the letter of demand then Australialink sends a document entitled "Notice of Intention --- Notice of Creditor's Commencement Proceedings" (" Notice of Intention ").
 The respondents attack paragraphs of the Statement of Claim which relate to the representations which the ACCC alleges are made by the sending out of the LAN documents and by the Notice of Intention document, which are annexed to the Statement of Claim.
