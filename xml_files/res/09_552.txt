 Order 11 r 1B(1) provides: 1B Pleading prepared by legal practitioner (1) If a pleading is prepared by a legal practitioner representing a party, the pleading must, when filed, be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Form 15B signed by the legal practitioner. ...
 Further, the Further Amended Defence admits the allegation made in the Statement of Claim that the second respondent, Mr Dargie, at all material times "is and was a director, shareholder and the accounts manager of Australialink"; and admits that the third respondent, Mr O'Keefe, at all material times, "is and was the general manager and computer systems manager of Australialink".
 The position, in my opinion, is that should that remain the position on the pleadings, and the ACCC succeeds in its allegation that the representations were made, the consequence is that the effect of O 11 r 13 is that the allegations of the untruth of the representations is deemed to be admitted.
