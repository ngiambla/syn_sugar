 The Tribunal accepts, on the basis of the applicant's evidence, there is a real chance he may refuse to serve because of his opposition to fighting and as such he may be liable to punishment.
 The Tribunal as then constituted did not consider that the imposition of any punishment on him would amount to him being treated any differently or in a discriminatory way because of his objection to serve, and so did not consider that he would be vulnerable to persecution for a Convention reason.
 The Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant would make known his views about objection to military service when he was in Israel nor that he would refuse to serve if he returned to Israel.
 What appears to have occurred, however, is that the Tribunal has not recognised that there was an apparently cogent body of evidence on that issue and so it has not addressed that issue.
