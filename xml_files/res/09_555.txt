 This is an application for extension of time to file and serve a Notice of Appeal from a decision of Jarrett FM in proceedings BRG 514 of 2008, given on 9 September 2008 in Cairns.
 The grounds of the applicant's application to the Federal Magistrates Court were expressed as: Delegates of the Respondents severally and jointly have deprived the Applicant of 7 years lawful Age Pension rights, totalling $93,173, as detailed in ANNEXURE B, page 13 of this application.
 Delegates of the Respondents severally and jointly have severely injured the Applicant's health and existential well-being through unwarranted stress over a 7-year period, for which the Applicant claims damages of $337,500, as detailed in ANNEXURE B, page 15, of this application.
 Following several successful Federal Court appeals by my brother on my behalf, the Full Federal Court finally ordered that my visa be granted on 23 March 2006. 5.
 On that day, I also made orders relevant to the applicant's requests concerning the application for fee waiver and review application, and on 11 January 2006 the MRT reviewed and approved the applicant's fee waiver application.
 The application is misconceived as remedies sought by the applicant in proposed Orders 1, 2 and 4 are not available pursuant to section 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).
 To be qualified for Age Pension, a person must have reached pension age and in this instance have 10 years 'qualifying Australian residence' as per Section 43(1) of the Social Security Act 1991 .
 Also attached to that supplementary submission is a letter dated 6 January 2009 from the applicant's brother, Joseph Moder, to Centrelink which says, in part: Mrs Sochorova holds a permanent residency visa granted on 23 March 2006.
 These proceedings are an application for an extension of time to appeal from the orders made by Jarrett FM in proceeding BRG 514 of 2008 given on 9 September 2008 in Cairns.
 They cannot therefore consider the correctness of any decision or direction which was made by Centrelink on or shortly before 16 January 2009 as to when the applicant would be entitled to an age pension.
 This application was filed promptly after the applicant was advised by the Australian Human Rights Commission determined that it was not the appropriate body to review the applicant's case.
 It is obvious that the "Notice of Appeal (Amended)" referred to in the submissions of the applicant filed 13 January 2009 relates to three separate matters: the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of 9 September 2008; the communication by the Australian Human Rights Commission to the applicant on 17 October 2008; and the communication by the Minister to the applicant on 11 December 2008.
 This document purports to appeal not only the judgment of Jarrett FM in Cairns of 9 September 2008, where his Honour dismissed the applicant's application in the Federal Magistrates Court for want of jurisdiction, but also seeks to challenge what is said to be decisions by the Australian Human Rights Commission of 17 October 2008, and by the Minister on 11 December 2008.
