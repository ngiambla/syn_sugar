 The subject matter of an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act is (shorn of the requirement to determine what, if any, entitlement to relief flows from the answer to the question or questions of law) of the same character as the subject matter of a reference of a question of law to the Court made under s 45 of the AAT Act.
 On 25 January 2008, the SSAT decided to: ... (2) set aside the decision relating to the rate(s) payable in the period 27 March 2002 to 9 September 2003 and send the matter back with the directions that the rate(s) be reassessed once Mr Theo supplies Centrelink with details of the Solon Family Trust sufficient for the purposes of an assessment under Part 3.18 of the Social Security Act 1991 .
 The AAT said, "It is true that he obliquely raised his single status in correspondence with Centrelink dated 11 July 2003", and the rate of $446.10 per fortnight was a reference to the then current single rate.
