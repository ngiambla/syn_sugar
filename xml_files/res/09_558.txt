 A taxpayer who claims a deduction under a particular description, and who does so in a way that is not, having regard to the disclosure made, false or misleading in relation to the facts, will not incur a penalty even though the amount may not be deductible as a matter of law.
 The relevant provision for these years is s.226H, which provides: 226H Subject to this Part, if: (a) a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and (b) the shortfall or part of it was caused by the recklessness of the taxpayer or of a registered tax agent with regards to the correct operation of this Act or the regulations; the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 50% of the amount of the shortfall or part.
