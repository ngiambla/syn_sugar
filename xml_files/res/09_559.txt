 Mr Wang asked the appellant to tell him his story and said that he, Mr Wang, would do everything else to get the appellant a visa and would speak to the Department.
 With respect to the Minister's submissions, it is true that Mr Wang did not advise the appellant not to open letters, not to get letters translated, and not to attend the Tribunal's hearing.
 Having dishonestly concealed his involvement from the Department and the Tribunal and nominated the appellant's address for service of correspondence, Mr Wang told the appellant to do nothing as he, Mr Wang, would look after everything.
