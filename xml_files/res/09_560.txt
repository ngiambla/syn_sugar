 In relation to the third of the matters for which Mr Priestley requested reasons, Mr Budak stated that Mr Priestley's letter of 27 August 2007 did not contain a request for investigation of the conduct of the former Merit Protection Commissioner.
 Therefore, the reasons set out by Mr Budak in the 17 October 2007 statement of reasons related only to his decision not to conduct further inquiries into the allegations made by Mr Priestley against the Parliamentary Service Commissioner.
 Ms Godwin submits that the statement of reasons was specifically drafted in response to the request made by Mr Priestley for such reasons and that the reasons addressed each of the decisions that, in his letter of 25 September 2007, he asserted had been made.
