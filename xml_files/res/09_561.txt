 BACKGROUND On 12 April 2007 Mr Priestley wrote to each of the then Presiding Officers concerning allegations in respect of the Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner, the Secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services, the Parliamentary Librarian and certain other persons.
 There is no evidence to suggest that the Presiding Officers made a decision not to include a reference to s 40(1)(b) of the Parliamentary Service Act in the letter of referral so as to deprive the Parliamentary Service Commissioner of her powers under that Act.
