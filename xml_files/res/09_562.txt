 As to the Registration and Collection Act, if a person to whom a liability in respect of child support is owed chooses to seek registration, the Registrar is required to register the liability, with the legal consequences earlier described.
 As explained by the High Court in Luton [2002] HCA 13 ; 210 CLR 333 , the Registrar must register in the Child Support Register kept under the Act a registrable maintenance liability once such a liability arises (see ss 23, 24 and 24A of the Collection Act).
 The obligation to register such a liability does not arise if the carer to whom the maintenance is owed elects to pursue his or her own remedies and not to take advantage of the Commonwealth's collection scheme under the Collection Act (s 23(3) and s 24A(2) of the Collection Act).
