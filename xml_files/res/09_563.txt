 The Tribunal is therefore satisfied the applicant and his family, were able to reside and work safely on their farm in Nepal, between July 2006 and February 2008 (at which time the applicant departed Nepal and his wife and children returned to reside in his parent's home in Ghorahi City).
 The Tribunal is also satisfied the applicant was able to obtain work commensurate with his skills in Nepal (between July 2006 and February 2008) as a farmer and there is no evidence before it that has satisfied the Tribunal he would not again be able to do so should he return to Nepal.
 That he did not do this has formed part of the reason the Tribunal is satisfied the applicant did not fear he had a real chance of persecution in his village between July 2006 and February 2008.
 For that reason the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a real chance of being persecuted for a Convention-based reason should he return to his village and work as a farmer: [64] of the Tribunal's reasons.
