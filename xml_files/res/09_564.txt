 The applicants say there is no evidence of KMF having acted as the responsible entity for any other scheme and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the insurers must be taken to have known the business of their insured.
 The insurers say this explains why (1) of the exclusion clause excludes "any Claim made against You, or any claim by You for indemnity under this Policy directly or indirectly arising out of work performed for or on behalf of Philips Fox (sic) Solicitors".
 The applicants say that similarly although cl 1.1 of the Policy would appear unlikely to cover KMF against loss suffered through the non repayment of loans to KMF in its capacity as lender, the effect of the exclusion is to make that clear out an abundance of caution.
