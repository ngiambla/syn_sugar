 The plaintiffs allege that they are not liable to ABB Grain for these amounts because ABB Grain failed to comply with various obligations placed on it under the Corporations Act and because it was in breach of a duty of care it owed to the plaintiffs.
 It is not disputed that the plaintiffs entered into a forward contract with Glencore Grain whereby the plaintiffs were under an obligation to deliver 1070 tonnes of barley to Glencore Grain at Port Lincoln in November/December 2007 at $203 per tonne.
 The plaintiffs allege that, in so far as the information was not known, ABB Grain and Glencore Grain each had a duty of care to ascertain the information and include it in the PDS.
 The alleged duty of care is said by the plaintiffs to arise from the fact that the parties entered into a contract or contracts and ABB Grain and Glencore Grain were required to provide PDS documents.
