 On 11 March 2008, in reasons for judgment published on that day, I declared that Australian Patent 774224 A barrier is, and has been at all material times, invalid, and I ordered that that patent, and each of the claims of the complete specification thereof, be revoked.
 The respondents also cross-claimed against the applicant, asserting that the patent was invalid on the grounds: (a) lack of novelty; (b) lack of inventive step; (c) not a patentable invention; (d) not a manner of manufacture; (e) lack of clarity; (f) no utility; (g) lack of fair basis.
 The usual order as to costs The expression the "usual order as to costs" embodies the important principle that, subject to certain limited exceptions, a successful party in litigation is entitled to an award of costs in its favour.
