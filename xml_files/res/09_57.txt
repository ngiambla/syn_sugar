 On 11 March 2008, in reasons for judgment published on that day, I declared that Australian Patent 774224 A barrier is, and has been at all material times, invalid, and I ordered that that patent, and each of the claims of the complete specification thereof, be revoked.
 The respondents also cross-claimed against the applicant, asserting that the patent was invalid on the grounds: (a) lack of novelty; (b) lack of inventive step; (c) not a patentable invention; (d) not a manner of manufacture; (e) lack of clarity; (f) no utility; (g) lack of fair basis.
 While it is not relevant on the question of costs in the principal proceedings, it is to be noted that an appeal against the judgment pronounced on 11 March 2008 was dismissed with costs by a Full Court of the Federal Court (Sundberg, Emmett and Greenwood JJ) on 31 October 2008.
 The question of costs is governed by s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which provides: (1) ... the Court or a Judge has jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before the Court (including proceedings dismissed for want of jurisdiction) other than proceedings in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded. ... (2) Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge.
 The general principle as to costs was expressed by Toohey J in Hughes v West Australian Cricket Association Inc Ors [1986] FCA 382 ; (1986) 8 ATPR 40-748 , at 48,136, where his Honour said: Ordinarily, costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives his costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order.
 As Devlin J said in Smeaton Hanscomb Co Ltd v Sassoon I Setty, Son Co [No 2] [1953] 1 WLR 1481 at 1484; [1953] 2 All ER 1588 at 1590, when setting aside an arbitrator's costs award: "the arbitrator is not directing his mind to one of the most, if not the most, important of the elements which ought to affect his discretion, namely the result of the case.
 To deprive him of his costs or to require him to pay a part of the costs of the other side is an exceptional measure. " The combined force of the sentiments recognised above by Mason CJ, regarding the need for consistency in order to avoid injustice, and by Devlin J, regarding the most significant factor affecting the costs discretion, provides the jurisprudential basis for the important principle commonly referred to as the "usual order as to costs".
 The primary purpose of an award of costs is to indemnify the successful party [ Latoudis [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 543, per Mason CJ; at 562-563, per Toohey J; at 566-567, per McHugh J; Cachia v Hanes [1994] HCA 14 ; (1994) 179 CLR 403 at 410; per Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson and McHugh JJ].
 Thus, the court may properly depart from the usual order as to costs when the successful party by its lax conduct effectively invites the litigation [ Jones v McKie [1964] 1 WLR 960; [1964] 2 All ER 842 ; Bostock [1900] 2 QB 616 at 622, 625, 627]; unnecessarily protracts the proceedings [ Forbes v Samuel [1913] 3 KB 706] ; succeeds on a point not argued before a lower court [ Armstrong v Boulton [1990] VR 215 at 223]; prosecutes the matter solely for the purpose of increasing the costs recoverable [ Hobbs v Marlowe [1978] AC 16] ; or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute [ Jenkins v Hope [1896] 1 Ch 278].
 Pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), on the whole of the material in these proceedings, I order that the applicant pay the respondents costs of and incidental to the proceedings, to be taxed if not agreed.
