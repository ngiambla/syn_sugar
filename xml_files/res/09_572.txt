 The first and second applicants commenced the proceeding as a representative proceeding under Part IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act by an application and statement of claim filed on 27 February 2008.
 In an earlier affidavit of 23 April 2009, Mr Reidy informed the Court that the Union would not look to the second applicant or any of the group members for any amount as contribution towards its costs and would not seek an order under s 33ZJ of the Federal Court of Australia Act for reimbursement of its costs.
 Mr Reidy further said that the deed of settlement provided that: (a) Contract Blinds would pay a total of $280,000 by way of wages in settlement of the claims of the second applicant and the group members; and (b) Contract Blinds would pay an additional $40,000 to the Union on account of its costs of the proceedings.
