 Section 249D(5) does not oblige the directors both to call and to arrange to hold the meeting within the 21 day period: it obliges them only to call it within that period.
 NSX contends that the condition precedent to the enlivening of the power of the shareholders under s 249E(1) found in the words "if the directors do not do so" is only the directors' failure to call a meeting within the 21 day period.
 It follows that the power conferred by s 249E(1) was enlivened and the defendants' notice given on Saturday 18 April 2009 validly called the meeting to be held on 28 May 2009. 3.
 It has not been suggested that there was any good reason for the directors to exercise their cl 10.2 power to call, or complete the calling of, a meeting by sending out the notice of meeting on 27 April 2009.
