 The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal from an order made by a judge of this Court on 16 April 2009.
 The respondent brought a notice of motion seeking the punishment of the applicant for contempt of court, in disobeying orders of this Court and failing to honour undertakings given to the Court.
 On 22 May 2009, the applicant filed and served a notice of appeal against the orders made on 13 May 2009 and, if pursued, that appeal will in due course be heard and determined by the Full Court of this Court.
 The applicant also wishes to appeal against the primary judge's declaration made on 16 April 2009, but he needs an extension of time to do that because he did not file and serve a notice of appeal within the 21 day period prescribed by O 52 r 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules .
 On 20 May 2009, the applicant issued an application for leave to appeal, supported by his own affidavit and an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal.
 At the outset of his submissions, I asked counsel for the applicant to formulate the orders he was seeking; the applicant is seeking either leave to appeal or an extension of time within which to appeal.
 The respondent filed an outline of submissions before the hearing and in that outline he submitted that the primary judge's orders made on 16 April 2009 and, indeed those made on 13 May 2009, were interlocutory orders.
 It is fully set out in the primary judge's reasons for finding the applicant guilty of contempt ( Jones v Toben [2009] FCA 354) and on penalty ( Jones v Toben (No 2) [2009] FCA 477).
 If a proposed appellant is unable to demonstrate any prospect of success in the appeal then that will be a reason to refuse an extension of time: Jeffers v The Queen [1993] HCA 11 ; (1993) 67 ALJR 288 ; 112 ALR 85 at 289; 86 per Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ.
 In this case, the respondent submits that the proposed appeal has no prospects of success and that, despite the other circumstances suggesting an extension of time should be granted, this factor is of sufficient weight to justify a refusal of the application for an extension of time.
 However, I cannot reach the conclusion that the proposed appeal has no prospect of success without hearing a good deal more from the parties, and any further hearing would approximate the hearing of the appeal itself.
