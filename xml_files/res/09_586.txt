 THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS Section 347(1)(b)(i) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) provides that an application for review in the present circumstances has to be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed period being a period ending not later than 28 days after the notification of the decision.
 Where the Minister gives notification in accordance with s 494B(4)(a) the person is taken to have received the document seven working days after the date of the document (s 494C(4)(a)).
 It qualifies the operation of the second sentence and makes clear that receipt of the letter for the purpose of the running of 21 days is the end of the seven days from the date of the letter.
