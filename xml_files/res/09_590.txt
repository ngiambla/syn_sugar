 As has been made clear in many cases (recently, for example, in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Prouds Jewellers Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 199 at [69] ), the only limitation on the exercise of the Court's discretion as to costs is that the discretion be exercised judicially.
 The confusion of the first and second respondents arose because Mrs Tracy's principal written submissions were filed late, and from what appeared to be the belief of the first and second respondents that the direction concerning the filing of any supplementary written submissions concerning a jurisdictional issue by 9 February 2009 limited the written submissions which the parties were entitled to file by 6 February 2009.
