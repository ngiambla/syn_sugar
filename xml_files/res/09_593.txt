 Plastics alleged that the patent in suit and its claims were invalid on the grounds of lack of novelty and lack of inventive step, as well as various other grounds.
 Plastics argued that the interpretation of the patent in suit and the Hancock et al patent would require expertise in the relevant technological art, which the Commissioner (but not a judge) might be said to have.
 In written submissions, VIP Plastic submitted that re-examination by the Commissioner would not relieve the Court of the task of deciding the questions of novelty and lack of inventive step for itself, assisted by expert evidence tested in the usual way.
 VIP Plastic went on to say that it did not anticipate that this would be a "particularly lengthy or involved matter" and would involve 3 or 4 witnesses.
