 The Visy respondents contend that nothing material has changed since those orders and that there is no need for further orders of discovery because the present application seeks documents that were sought but not ordered to be produced on the previous application.
 Professor Rubinfeld has read and refers to an affidavit of Ms Rebecca Gilsenan (Ms Gilsenan), the solicitor acting for Jarra Creek, dated 9 December 2008, which sets out inconsistencies and gaps in the material produced on behalf of the Visy respondents and notes that some of this discovered material also refers to low level specific data known to exist from documents discovered and information given to her.
 She states that she does not have sufficient data at customer and product levels to allow the Jarra Creek's representatives to ascertain the process by customer or product or by classes of customer or product.
 The material presently furnished is at a high level of generality and Ms Gilsenan says that while she has some low level data of a specific nature, it is restricted to particular customers or limited time periods, and there is not enough to determine net pricing even for those customers.
