 Secondly, and in the alternative, a more specific order is sought seeking discovery and production of a Logistics Database referred to in an affidavit of Mr Zwier, filed on behalf of the Visy respondents in this matter, as well as discovery of other electronic records so far as they contain data of CFP sales, and production data, and also information relating to Pulp Paper Products (PPP), as to sales and production data at a low level of particularity, together with details of sales/price, costs of production and production data for the products at customer level.
 The Visy respondents contend that nothing material has changed since those orders and that there is no need for further orders of discovery because the present application seeks documents that were sought but not ordered to be produced on the previous application.
 It is submitted for Jarra Creek that the court should note that since the earlier discovery order the Amcor respondents have agreed to provide documentation at a far greater level of specificity than in the original orders and further that there is additional material from Professor Rubinfeld (of 19 Nov ember 2008), an economic expert, retained on behalf of Jarra Creek, to the effect that in order to determine whether the alleged cartel arrangement can be properly the subject of an expert opinion, it is necessary to have discovery in relation to the sales/price, costs of production and production data at the production facility level.
 Also, in order to construct a proper economic model, and conduct a detailed analysis of conditions conducive to cartel formation and quantify the effect on market process, Professor Rubinfeld considers that is necessary to obtain sales/price, costs of production and production data at customer level and product level.
 Professor Rubinfeld has read and refers to an affidavit of Ms Rebecca Gilsenan (Ms Gilsenan), the solicitor acting for Jarra Creek, dated 9 December 2008, which sets out inconsistencies and gaps in the material produced on behalf of the Visy respondents and notes that some of this discovered material also refers to low level specific data known to exist from documents discovered and information given to her.
 In summary, Ms Gilsenan says that the financial data discovered by Visy is aggregated at the level of production facility which would allow Jarra Creek to calculate the difference between costs and sales prices on average for all, but not each, of the customers of a particular facility, but that the coverage is incomplete and it would be necessary to make assumptions.
 She states that she does not have sufficient data at customer and product levels to allow the Jarra Creek's representatives to ascertain the process by customer or product or by classes of customer or product.
 Mr Leon Zwier (Mr Zwier), solicitor for the Visy respondents, has filed evidence in this matter and in his Fourth Affidavit of 8 December 2008 he refers to the earlier discovery decision over a year ago.
 In paragraphs 22-28 of his affidavit he spells out further details of the database and points to the extremely large volume of documents arising from the fact that at any given time between 1 January 1998 and 1 May 2005 Visy had between approximately 5,000 and 7,000 different customers from time to time.
 He expresses the view of the Visy respondents that to the extent that financial information at the customer level is relevant to the issues in the proceeding, it is in substance only relevant to the calculation of alleged loss or damage of individual customers who are group members, and that the calculation of any loss or damage suffered by individual customers who are group members should await the determination of liability and other common issues in the proceeding.
 Mr Zwier says that if the Court proposes to order discovery in respect of the alleged loss or damage suffered by individual customers of Visy who are group members, it would be necessary to identify which of its customers are group members.
 The Visy respondents contend that the production of the material is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings and that the degree of detail extends to particulars of damages or loss in relation to individual customers and that it is not appropriate to provide this material.
