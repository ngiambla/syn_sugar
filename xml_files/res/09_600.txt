 It would be embarrassing for the Commissioner to be required to provide such particulars when the existence of a tax benefit obtained in connection with a scheme does not turn on his opinion and he is not a party to any of the transactions and other conduct of Futuris relevant to the Part IVA inquiry before the Court.
 In other words, the applicant seeks to get particulars of the transactions or arrangements the respondent says would have occurred, leading to the relevant amount of the tax benefit being included (or being reasonably expected to have been included) in the assessable income of the applicant.
 The applicant submitted that the particulars sought go to that matter, and drew a direct link between the language used in s 177C(1) and the particulars sought, being particulars of the events which the respondent alleges would have occurred had the scheme not been entered into.
 The issues in the proceeding will be whether the applicant obtained a "tax benefit", and if it did, whether it could be concluded that the relevant scheme was entered into or carried out for the dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit.
