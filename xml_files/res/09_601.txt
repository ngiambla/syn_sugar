 One fundamental difference is that when undertaking the task of considering whether a sequestration order " ought not to have been made ", the Court is not confined to a consideration of only that material which was before the person making the order.
 As Heinrich and Bulic make clear, " the Court is not confined to a consideration of whether the order should have been made on the facts known to the Court at the time at which it was made.
 After the expiration of that period, it was contended there was either: (i) no power to extend " the life of the petition "; or, alternatively (ii) the Appellant had been denied natural justice by the Magistrate who made that order in April 2008.
