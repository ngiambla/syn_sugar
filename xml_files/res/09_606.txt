 The Choc a Block range was blue and bore a product descriptor depending upon which bite size confectionary happened to be in the package.
 That is, there were Choc a Block choc balls, Choc a Block malt balls, Choc a Block wafer bites and Choc a Block "cha cha" (chocolate lentils).
 The link between the appearance of the red and orange jars and the supposed product equivalence must, therefore, be founded upon some aspect of the reputation inhering in the Maltesers product.
 The consequence of that conclusion is that there was trade mark use by Sweet Rewards but that it was only the Delfi mark which constituted that use.
