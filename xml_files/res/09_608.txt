 Firstly, it claims that employees have not had a ' reasonable opportunity to decide whether they want to approve the agreement ' as required by s 340(2) of the Act.
 Secondly, the AMWU claims that Luxottica's business is a multiple-business within s 331 of the Act and accordingly the Commission cannot approve the proposed agreement since it is not a single business agreement as defined in s 328 of Act.
 The AMWU submits that, contrary to the statements, if a 'no' vote resulted it would have the direct and immediate consequence that the extant Retail Agreement and Distribution Agreement would continue to operate.
 As a consequence, the AMWU submits that the proposed agreement cannot be submitted to the Workplace Authority Director as a ' single business agreement ' in accordance with s 342 of the Act.
