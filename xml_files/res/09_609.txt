 On 20 April 2009 I delivered reasons substantially declining the applicant's motions for further particular discovery, refusing an order to direct the respondents to respond to its notice to admit facts and refusing any order for leave to serve notices to produce ( Austal Ships Pty Ltd (ACN 079 160 679) v Incat Australia Pty Ltd (ACN 051 556 855) [2009] FCA 368).
 By far the majority of the hearing both in terms of actual hearing time and preparation for the hearing was taken up in the applicant's pursuit of wide ranging discovery which I described as fishing.
 I have accepted the assurance given by senior counsel for the respondents which was that if formalisation of discovery was all that had been sought, it would have been provided promptly.
 I remain of the view that the more appropriate exercise of discretion is that there be no order as to costs because the applicant substantively failed in pursuit of its relief and the pursuit of its relief took up much more time than did the motion for judgment pursued by the respondents.
