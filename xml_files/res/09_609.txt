 By far the majority of the hearing both in terms of actual hearing time and preparation for the hearing was taken up in the applicant's pursuit of wide ranging discovery which I described as fishing.
 I remain of the view that the more appropriate exercise of discretion is that there be no order as to costs because the applicant substantively failed in pursuit of its relief and the pursuit of its relief took up much more time than did the motion for judgment pursued by the respondents.
