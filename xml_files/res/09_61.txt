 Order 2 as proposed by Optiver is expressed to be without limiting Order 1, and particularises a series of detailed orders relating to computer program source codes and object codes, to be produced by the Respondents within 7 days.
 Mr King's evidence is that to produce an object code for a particular version of the source code it would be necessary to obtain the source code from the historical source repository and run the program.
 I do not therefore accept the submission by Tibra that Optiver's entitlement to inspect source codes should be limited to computer programs which performed the functions for example as at 5 September 2006 and 19 June 2007.
