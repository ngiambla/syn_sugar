 National Biofuels began these proceedings in November 2008 seeking declarations that, in effect, it was entitled to, and had validly, terminated an agreement made in September 2008 with the defendant, Elbow River concerning the importation into Australia from Canada of 3,500 metric tonnes of biodiesel fuel.
 In addition, National Biofuels pleaded that around 4 November 2008 it received a copy of the asserted terms relied upon by Elbow River, which are at the heart of Elbow River's case but which National Biofuels said formed no part of the contractual arrangements.
 Elbow River pleaded that it was at all material times ready and willing to perform the contract alleged by it but that by reason of National Biofuels' wrongful rejection of the cargo and its failure to pay the price, Elbow River accepted National Biofuels' repudiation and resold the cargo in Malaysia, suffering a loss of approximately USD1,900,000.
