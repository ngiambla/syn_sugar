 This is, or at least purports to be, an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") instituted pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ("the AAT Act").
 There was material before the Tribunal which admitted of a conclusion that the payment that came to be made to Mr Borcherdt, pursuant to the order of the court, was one which was made in respect of economic loss.
