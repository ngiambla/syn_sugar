 The Tribunal erred in law in concluding that an application of a fund 'substantially in accordance with its constituent terms' satisfies the requirement of section 50-60 that the fund 'is applied for the purposes for which it was established', and should have held that application of part of the fund otherwise than for the purposes for which it was established caused the Respondent to fail to meet the requirement in section 50-60.
 Hence it was necessary to do in relation to ss 50-57, 50-60 and 50-65 what it was not necessary to do in relation to s 50-50, namely make express provision for loss of tax exemption where the trust or fund was not applied for the purposes for which it was established.
