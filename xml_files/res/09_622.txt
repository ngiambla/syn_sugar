 On 25 October 2007 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant inviting him to comment on the fact that no mention had been made of his political activities until the letter from his agent dated 2 July 2007.
 The Federal Magistrate identified the relevant test to be applied when considering whether a duty to inquire arises and he applied that test to the circumstances of the case.
 The Federal Magistrate did not err in concluding that the Tribunal did not fall into jurisdictional error by refraining from making inquiries of the agent about the circumstances in which the political claims were not included in the visa application.
