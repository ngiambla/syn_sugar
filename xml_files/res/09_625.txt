 Because Mr Den Boer and Mr McInerney believed that MCA was about to fail due to the apparent imminent loss of business from Tony Ferguson Licensing, they decided that Mr Den Boer (through MCA's sole shareholder, RSW) should cause MCA to go into voluntary liquidation.
 As explained below, since the commencement of the winding up on 17 April 2009, an accommodation has been reached between Mr Cain, Mr Den Boer and Mr McInerney.
 Mr Den Boer states in para 12 of his affidavit of 12 May 2009 that the effect of the settlement was that SC would release MCA from all of its claims.
 As noted at [13] above, the total of the unit holders' loan account balances at the date of the Liquidators' appointment was $443,109 and the revised total remains that figure.
