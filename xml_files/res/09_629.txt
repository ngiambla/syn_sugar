 The sale agreement is to be completed on 10 June 2009, however the purchase price is payable in two instalments: As the obligations of the parties will extend beyond three months after the sale agreement is entered into, the liquidators require approval pursuant to s 477(2B) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) before entering into the sale agreement on behalf of Victorian Families.
 Mr Khatri also deposes that he is not aware of any circumstances that would give rise to a concern by the Court, whether by way of error of law, bad faith, impropriety or otherwise, that it should not grant its approval for the liquidators on behalf of Victorian Families to enter into the sale agreement on its behalf.
