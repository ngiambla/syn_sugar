 Sixth, it is clear that under s 29 Bankruptcy Act the Court has power to appoint a receiver of the respondent's property in Australia in aid of the administration of the respondent's insolvent estate in the United Kingdom: Re Ayres; Ex parte Evans (1981) 51 FLR at 408-409; Ayres v Evans (1981) 56 FLR at 240, 247, 255; Radich v Bank of New Zealand at 121-122; Dick as Trustee in Bankruptcy v McIntosh at [19].
 Finally, I note that s 21 Cross Border Insolvency Act 2008 (Cth) provides: If the Model Law (as it has the force of law in Australia) or a provision of this Act is inconsistent with section 29 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 , the Model Law or the provision of this Act prevails, and that section has no effect to the extent of the inconsistency.
 However in the circumstances I consider that: Were the respondent a bankrupt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act I consider that, on the evidence before me, the Court would have both jurisdiction and cause to make a freezing order to prevent frustration or abuse of the Court's process pursuant to O 25A Federal Court Rules .
