 In proceeding 4111 of 2006 in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (the Supreme Court Proceeding), Mr Carroll as trustee for the Hobbs Carroll Property Trust sought against Benson Communications Pty Limited as trustee for the Grantham Project (Trust), amongst other things a taking of accounts to determine what amount, if any, was owed by one partner/joint venturer to the other.
 On 7 October 2008, the solicitor for Mr Carroll as trustee for the Hobbs Carroll Property Trust signed a statutory demand addressed to Benson Communications Pty Limited as trustee for the Grantham Project (Trust) for the said sum of $446,314.14.
 This led to the commencement of this present proceeding (the Statutory Demand Proceeding) by which Benson Communications Pty Limited as trustee for The Grantham Project (Trust) applies for an order setting aside the statutory demand.
 Notwithstanding this, Benson Communications Pty Limited has appealed the Supreme Court decision on the basis that it was not aware of or overlooked the fact that it was consenting to a judgment in favour of Mr Carroll as trustee of the Hobbs Carroll Property Trust.
