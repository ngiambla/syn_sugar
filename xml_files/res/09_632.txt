 On 7 October 2008, the solicitor for Mr Carroll as trustee for the Hobbs Carroll Property Trust signed a statutory demand addressed to Benson Communications Pty Limited as trustee for the Grantham Project (Trust) for the said sum of $446,314.14.
 This led to the commencement of this present proceeding (the Statutory Demand Proceeding) by which Benson Communications Pty Limited as trustee for The Grantham Project (Trust) applies for an order setting aside the statutory demand.
