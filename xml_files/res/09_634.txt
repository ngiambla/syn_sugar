 The first respondent, Jeff Jackson, however, claims that the proceeding is incompetent --- at least to the extent that it relies on ss 163 , 164 and 164A of the Schedule --- because it should have been commenced by rule to show cause under Division 3 of O 48 of the Rules.
 Section 163 of the Schedule permits a member of an organisation to apply to the court for an order declaring the whole or any part of a rule of the organisation to be in contravention of s 142 of the Schedule, or for an order that the rules of the organisation contravene s 142 in a particular respect.
 Subsection (2) contains an extensive list of the persons who may apply for financial assistance, including the following: (a) a person who made an application under section 163 , 164 or 164A, where the Federal Court granted a rule calling on another person, or an organisation, to show cause why an order should not be made under section 163 , 164 or 164A in relation to the other person or organisation; (q) a person who made an application under section 167 , where the Federal Court granted a rule calling on another person, or an organisation, to show cause why an order should not be made under subsection 167(2) in relation to the other person or organisation.
 As will be apparent presently, the significance of these provisions is that they make the grant of a rule to show cause a condition of a person's entitlement to apply for financial assistance where the person is an applicant in a proceeding in the court under ss 163 , 164 or 164A of the Schedule.
 A "rule to show cause" is defined in r 5 as --- ... a rule calling on a person, or an organisation, to show cause why an order should not be made under section 163, 164 or 164A, or subsection 167 (2) of the RAO Schedule in relation to the person or organisation.
 The respondents' argument is based upon the provisions of r 6 of the order, which are as follows: (1) This Division applies to an application for a rule to show cause. (2) However, this Division does not apply unless the granting of a rule to show cause is necessary, under paragraph 324 (2) (a) or (q) of the RAO Schedule, for the Minister to authorise payment of financial assistance to an applicant for an order under section 163, 164 or 164A, or subsection 167 (2) of the RAO Schedule.
 She says that a rule to show cause may well be a necessary precondition to an entitlement to apply for financial assistance under s 324 of the Schedule, but it is not a mandated procedure for the commencement of a proceeding which relies on ss 163, 164 or 164A.
 Subrules (1) and (2) were as follows: (1) This rule shall operate only for so long as sub-section 141A(2) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 specifies the making of a rule as a condition precedent to the grant of financial assistance. (2) A proceeding under section 140 of section 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 shall be by rule in accordance with Form 6 calling upon the person or organization concerned to show cause why the order should not be made.
 Subrules (1) and (2) of O 4 r 15 were as follows: (1) This rule operates only for so long as paragraph 342(2)(a) of the Act specifies the making of a rule as a condition precedent to the grant of financial assistance. (2) A proceeding under sections 208 or 209 of the Act must be by rule, in accordance with Form 6, calling upon the person or organisation concerned to show cause why the order should not be made.
 All of the provisions to which I have referred --- whether it be reg 70 of the Regulations made under the C A Act or relevant rules of court --- down to 1997 required a proceeding under the provisions which are now ss 163 and 164 of the Schedule to be commenced by rule to show cause.
 Most recently, O 4 r 15(2) of the Rules of the Industrial Relations Court provided that a proceeding under what were then ss 208 and 209 of the IR Act "must be by rule ... calling upon the person or organisation concerned to show cause why the order should not be made".
