 As will be apparent presently, the significance of these provisions is that they make the grant of a rule to show cause a condition of a person's entitlement to apply for financial assistance where the person is an applicant in a proceeding in the court under ss 163 , 164 or 164A of the Schedule.
 A "rule to show cause" is defined in r 5 as --- ... a rule calling on a person, or an organisation, to show cause why an order should not be made under section 163, 164 or 164A, or subsection 167 (2) of the RAO Schedule in relation to the person or organisation.
 According to the respondents, that history explains why r 6 is to be construed as setting up a mandatory requirement that a proceeding under s 163 , 164 or 164A be commenced by rule to show cause, notwithstanding that no such requirement appears explicitly stated in the terms of that rule.
 Although there was then no equivalent to the present s 164A of the Schedule, provisions equivalent to the present ss 163 and 164 were to be found in ss 140 and 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth) ("the C A Act").
