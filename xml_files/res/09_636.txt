 At the first meeting of creditors of AGL, Mr Silvia as Chairman informed those present that he and Mr Green proposed to seek the extension of the convening period for up to four months.
 In Daisytek [2003] FCA 575 ; 45 ACSR 446 , I noted that the granting of an extension of time left untouched the problem that s 439A(2) required that the meeting be held within five business days after the extended convening period.
 The 2007 Act altered the position to require that the meeting be held within five business days before or within five business days after the end of the convening period or that period as extended.
