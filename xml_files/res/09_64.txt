 Sections 48B and 417 of the Act, referred to by the Federal Magistrates Court, empower the Minister to make certain decisions in favour of an applicant for a protection visa (despite other provisions of the Act) if satisfied it is in the public interest to do so.
 I agree with the conclusion of the Federal Magistrates Court that the appellant's claims about the circumstances in Nepal that postdate the Tribunal's decision cannot found any claim of error by the Tribunal.
 The Tribunal's reasons for its decision of 31 October 2007 disclose that the appellant attended the further hearing and gave evidence about, amongst other things, the kidnapping of his son which prompted the appellant to move his family to Kathmandu.
