 I agree with the conclusion of the Federal Magistrates Court that the appellant's claims about the circumstances in Nepal that postdate the Tribunal's decision cannot found any claim of error by the Tribunal.
 The Tribunal's reasons for its decision of 31 October 2007 disclose that the appellant attended the further hearing and gave evidence about, amongst other things, the kidnapping of his son which prompted the appellant to move his family to Kathmandu.
