 The Blue Water Joint Venture is engaged in a project (the Blue Water Project) on 28 hectares of land in the Kurnell area of Sydney (the Kurnell premises) to design and construct a seawater desalination plant and associated infrastructure.
 It is convenient to consider, as the first legal issue, whether the second and third respondents held, at the time of the events just described, a right of entry under state occupational health and safety law.
 The first is what is meant by "officer of that organisation (including any person who is concerned in, or takes part in, the management of that organisation)" in s 76 of the OHS Act.
 The applicants in their further amended statement of claim alleged the second and third respondent were at all material times employed by the first respondent in the capacity of organiser.
