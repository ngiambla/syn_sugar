 The CFMEU was determined not to obey the Order and did not make a reasonable attempt to comply with the Order: see Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 ; (2003) 196 ALR 350 at 358.
 On appeal, a Full Court found that the CFMEU was guilty of contempt on a more limited basis than that found by her Honour: see Construction, Forestry, Mining Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1758.
 Courts, however, have awarded costs on a party and party basis (see: for example, Jones v Toben (No 2 ) [2009] FCA 477) and on an indemnity basis (see: for example, BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 702).
