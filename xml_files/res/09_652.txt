 The Respondents are to pay their own costs of and in connection with the application for leave to re-open made by the Respondents on 7 May 2009 (including the preparation of all evidence the subject of the application for leave to re-open).
 During the hearing on costs I observed that the practical effect of the respondents' submissions is that the respondents would obtain orders entitling them to claim all of their costs from one or other of the applicants.
 The defendant, having been found to be in the wrong, will be partially immunised against the proper costs of the successful plaintiff by the unmeritorious circumstance that the action was simultaneously brought by other, unsuccessful, plaintiffs".
 Nor, however, do I accept the applicants' approach that the usual order as to costs should be made, excluding only the costs relating to the two claims which the applicants abandoned at the start of the hearing.
