 With the assistance of the National Native Title Tribunal (the Tribunal) the parties reached agreement in February 2009 as to the terms of a determination of native title and orders in respect of the land and waters covered by part of the first application and all of the second application.
 Further, in broad terms the effect of the proposed determination is to recognise in relation to the Mandora, Wallal Downs and Anna Plains pastoral leases falling within Determination Area Part A non exclusive rights, including the right to access and move through the areas and the right to live on the area.
 Thus, the main concern of the Court when considering an application under s 87 and s 87A is whether there has been a genuine agreement which was made freely and on an informed basis: Nangkiriny v State of Western Australia (2002) 117 FCR 6 ; [2002] FCA 660 at [14] .
 A relevant consideration on this aspect will be whether the parties have had independent and competent legal representation and, in the case of State parties, whether they have given appropriate consideration to the claims of the applicants: Munn (for and on behalf of the Gunggari People) v Queensland (2001) 115 FCR 109 ; [2001] FCA 1229 at [29] .
 One of Mr Matthews' affidavits proves that the Corporation was registered under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (Cth) on 11 March 2009 and was thus a prescribed body corporate for the purposes of ss 56(2) and (3) (see reg 4(1) of the Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 (Cth) (the Regulations).
