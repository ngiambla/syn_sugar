 A relevant consideration on this aspect will be whether the parties have had independent and competent legal representation and, in the case of State parties, whether they have given appropriate consideration to the claims of the applicants: Munn (for and on behalf of the Gunggari People) v Queensland (2001) 115 FCR 109 ; [2001] FCA 1229 at [29] .
