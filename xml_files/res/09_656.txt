 Ms Yousif gave evidence that Mr Porter told her she was greedy and selfish and Ms Yousif felt that he was angry with her.

 Mr Monopoli told Mr Porter that he would not look to hire Ms Yousif until Mr Porter had a week to work through her concerns and then he would revisit the situation.
 Mr Porter recalls telling Mr Carney that he had held several telephone conversations with Ms Yousif and thought that he could not persuade her to stay in the Western Region.
