 The applicant, Linda Yousif, filed this application on 20 February 2009 following the termination of her employment by the respondent, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the Bank) which occurred on 8 December 2008.
 As you must appreciate, your employment with the Bank cannot continue in circumstances where there is no longer a relationship of mutual trust and confidence and you have clearly indicated that you do not wish to return to work.
 She didn't trust the Bank and she didn't trust the senior executives of the Bank; and, therefore, I took that as an irretrievable breakdown and I took the --- the decision to terminate the services.
