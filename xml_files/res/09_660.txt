 Although not a matter of exact consensus between the parties, it seems from the pleadings that the contract by which Yarra Trams engaged for these construction works to be performed was made between itself and John Holland.
 I agree, with respect, that O 6 r 8(1)(b) is not brought into operation merely by the circumstance that a cause of action may be legitimately prosecuted against the proposed respondent in the existing proceeding.
 John Holland also submits that, if O 6 r 8 is available as a source of power in the present circumstances, the court should nonetheless, as a matter of discretion, decline to make the order sought by the applicant.
