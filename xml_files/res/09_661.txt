 Mr Zoia, however, did not wish to make such an amendment and opposed the amendment being made by the Court.
 Although the 'appeal' was listed for hearing, Mr Zoia did not wish to and did not address any of the grounds in his notice of appeal but rather chose to address the procedural point.
 Rule 8 of O 1 is a slightly different provision entitling the Court to dispense with compliance of the requirements of the Rules where appropriate.
 As this case illustrates, the approach contended for by Mr Zoia would cause the wheels of justice to grind to a holt.
