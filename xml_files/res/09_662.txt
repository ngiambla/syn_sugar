 But the argument for the Inspector-General was that the simple application of the ordinary meaning of the words in s 139L(1)(a)(vii) BA meant that the fees paid to the Company were still assessable income as determined by the Inspector-General.
 But it was still necessary that there be undertaken a characterisation of those payments in order to determine whether or not they were 'income derived by the bankrupt' as distinct from income derived by a third party.
 It followed, accordingly, by virtue of s 139M(1)(b) and (c) respectively that the Company's income as derived by Mr McGushin was his income for the purposes of assessment even though it was not received by him.
