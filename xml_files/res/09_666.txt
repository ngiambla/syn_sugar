 The urgency comes about by reason of the fact that over eight million of the scratch cards are in circulation and a further large number of approximately 1.3 million cards will be distributed this Thursday 11 June 2009.
 I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that both of the scratch cards are misleading and deceptive in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth).
 The second is that the prize most likely to be won is a voucher for a "FlexiBreak weekend holiday" which entails the payment of a sum of money to a hotel operator or other party in order to obtain the benefit offered by the voucher.
 The cost to Clarion of the voucher is $1 but the value to a successful subscriber will depend upon whether, in the usual circumstances, the subscriber wishes to pay for one night's accommodation to get a second night free.
