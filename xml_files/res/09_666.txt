 The first is that the cards misrepresent to consumers that if they match the necessary symbols, they will be able to claim a prize by sending an SMS to Clarion (at normal SMS charges) whereas in truth a subscriber is required to pay a $10 "joining fee" which may be valid for six days, and a subscription fee of $10 every six days to obtain the content promoted by Clarion.
 The second is that the prize most likely to be won is a voucher for a "FlexiBreak weekend holiday" which entails the payment of a sum of money to a hotel operator or other party in order to obtain the benefit offered by the voucher.
 The cost to Clarion of the voucher is $1 but the value to a successful subscriber will depend upon whether, in the usual circumstances, the subscriber wishes to pay for one night's accommodation to get a second night free.
 In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 ; [2006] HCA 46 at [65] , Gummow and Hayne JJ said that it is enough for a plaintiff to show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify, in the circumstances, the preservation of the status quo pending trial; how strong the probability need be depends on the practical consequences likely to flow from the relief.
 He pointed in particular to the observations of the High Court in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited (2000) 202 CLR 45 ; [2000] HCA 12 at [101] to [103], and he emphasised the full wording of the scratch cards and the leisurely circumstances in which a hypothetical, reasonable consumer will be likely to be able to study the full details.
 I accept Mr Webb's submission that the observations of Logan J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Mobilegate Ltd A Company Incorporated in Hong Kong [2009] FCA 539 at [1] and [28] are distinguishable from the present matter.
 It merely requires Clarion to send an SMS to a scratch card winner informing him or her that to claim a prize it is necessary to pay the subscription fees to which I have referred, as well as to give some indication of the value of the prize that has been won.
 The orders I will make are as set out in the short minutes of order handed up by Ms Higgins for the Commission, save that the form of the SMS message set out in paragraph 1.1 is to be as follows: Free Msg Must subscribe 2 Mobyplanet 2 get prize $10 every 6 days.
