 I am satisfied that Mr Collett was not confined once he and the two other Australians left the surrender area and, accordingly, he was not interned at any time thereafter.
 The absence of such confinement is demonstrated by his capacity to retain possession of his rifle and ammunition for some 2 hours and then to leave the area and go to the beach.
 In the result then, for the reasons given, the meaning of the definition of "confined in ... other place" in para (a) of the definition of "interned" is tolerably clear without recourse to secondary materials.
