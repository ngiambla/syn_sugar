 It follows, the Commissioner argued, that 'juices of fruits' and 'fruit juice' are not synonymous and any purported trade meaning as to 'fruit juice' in the beverage industry (being the definition in the Foods Standard Code ) has no relevance to the interpretation of the expression 'juices of fruits'.
 The Commissioner's position is that in order for Items 11 and 12 to be satisfied, the beverage must be constituted by the mixing (through some mechanical process) of the juices of fruits with the other part of a beverage so as to produce the final beverage.
