 According to the Commissioner, the applicant is not correct in submitting that the expressions 'juices of fruits' is an anachronism resulting from the history of the sales tax legislation and that the meaning intended to be conveyed by the draftsman by the use of that expression was the same as 'fruit juice'.
 It follows, the Commissioner argued, that 'juices of fruits' and 'fruit juice' are not synonymous and any purported trade meaning as to 'fruit juice' in the beverage industry (being the definition in the Foods Standard Code ) has no relevance to the interpretation of the expression 'juices of fruits'.
 The Commissioner's position is that in order for Items 11 and 12 to be satisfied, the beverage must be constituted by the mixing (through some mechanical process) of the juices of fruits with the other part of a beverage so as to produce the final beverage.
 When the final beverage is being made by the mixing of the addition of grape juice concentrates, the low sugar juice and the de-alcoholised base wine it is not possible to say that something has been added to a beverage that consisted either wholly or of least 90% by volume of juices of grapes.
