 THE OFFICE OF THE EMPLOYMENT ADVOCATE AND THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK The dispute between the parties involves the interpretation of an undertaking which had been given by Harbour City and Ms Robertson to the OEA and which was incorporated into the AWA.
 The solicitor for Harbour City and Ms Robertson swore an affidavit saying that the case had been conducted on the basis that it would be left for her Honour to construe the various instruments arising for consideration.
 For Ms Cargill it is conceded that her Honour erred in applying the post-reform WR Act and the guarantee of basic rates of minimum pay in the post-reform WR Act to the construction of the AWA.
 Her Honour did consider the no-disadvantage test pointing out: The principle of no-disadvantage is not only enshrined in the Act via the no-disadvantage test but also within the principal object of the WR Act as set out in section 3.
