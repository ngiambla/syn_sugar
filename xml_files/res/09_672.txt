 Since Mrs Vranic was a person who was receiving Newstart allowance on 21 April 2008 and who on that date was characterised by Centrelink as a person who "has not been receiving a social security benefit [relevantly here a Newstart allowance] for a continuous period of at least 9 months", Centrelink determined that the maximum rate of benefit payable to her was $437.10 per fortnight.
 Thus, it follows, she contends, that she has received Newstart allowance for "a continuous period of at least 9 months" which satisfies the requirements of item (c) of clause 5 and qualifies her for the higher rate of benefit.
 Similarly, by clause 5 of Table B, once Mrs Vranic has been receiving for a continuous period of at least nine months a social security benefit (or other entitlement identified in clause 5) she is entitled to then receive the higher rate of benefit.
