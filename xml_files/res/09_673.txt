 Could it ever be permissible under the terms of the Old Agreement for the respondent to require a renewing franchisee to accept terms in the form of the New Agreement submitted to the applicant or substantially in that form?
 The respondent objects to claim 9J, which pleads that: The actions referred to in paragraph 9H were substantially commenced before Allphones proposed to introduce new agreements substantially less favourable than the terms of the Old Agreement and without prior notice of that intention.
 The respondent says the allegations are irrelevant in the absence of an allegation that the group members would not have so acted in the manner pleaded therein in the absence of the specified conduct of the respondent, which conduct must be identified.
 The respondent objects to claim 12F, which alleges that Allphones "has applied undue pressure to franchisees to induce them to accept new terms and give the releases" referred to in claim 12E, in a number of ways particularised in claims 12F.1 --- 12F.10.
