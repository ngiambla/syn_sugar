 For these reasons, it is important to say something about the source, origin and nature of the rights of the Kuuku Ya'u People; the application which is today resolved by this determination; and, the agreement reached by the parties which has led to the proposed consent orders.
 Because such orders necessarily and critically provide for a determination of native title, the order must, by operation of s 94A of the Act, set out details of the matters addressed by s 225 of the Act.
 I am satisfied the material has been made available to the Commonwealth and the State and the material has been taken into account, in particular, by the State of Queensland in evaluating the claims of the Kuuku Ya'u People.
