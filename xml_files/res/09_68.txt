 Section 56 of the Court Act in conjunction with Order 28 of the Federal Court Rules contemplates an order for security directed to a person who makes a claim for relief in the relevant proceeding.
 Nevertheless, s 197(e) of the Act confers broad power to "... give any judgment, or make any order , that, in all the circumstances, it thinks fit on hearing an appeal against a decision or direction of the Registrar" [emphasis added].
