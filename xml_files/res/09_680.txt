 However, I accept Ms Poniatowska's evidence that she expressed a concern about working with Mr Lotito, and I find that Ms Sharrad's acknowledged comment was made in that context.

 I will address the consequences of the sexual harassment constituted by the May 2005 allegations and the Lotito allegations when I turn to the question of relief.
