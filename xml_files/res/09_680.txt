 I have come to the view that I should, as I do, accept some of the evidence of Ms Poniatowska and some of the evidence of Mr M Hickinbotham, Ms Sharrad and Mr Daminato.
 I accept that Ms Poniatowska sat next to Mr Flynn on the bus and at the lunch, but on each occasion it was with a group of building consultants.
 However, I accept Ms Poniatowska's evidence that she expressed a concern about working with Mr Lotito, and I find that Ms Sharrad's acknowledged comment was made in that context.
 It is also supportive of, and consistent with, what I have found to have been a robust environment that Ms Sharrad made that comment, and did so in the office area where others could hear it.
 He said that Ms Poniatowska then started to discuss Ms Sharrad and the warning letters and invited him to agree that Ms Sharrad had victimised her.
 Ms Poniatowska confirmed that on 12 December 2005 she sold Lot 20, rather than Lot 21, to Ms Scoble and Mr Jones (the fourth of the four extracted entries).
 I also find that in the circumstances a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that Ms Poniatowska would be offended and humiliated by that conduct.
 I will address the consequences of the sexual harassment constituted by the May 2005 allegations and the Lotito allegations when I turn to the question of relief.
 I have referred above to my findings about why Ms Poniatowska was given the three warning letters, the suspension letter, and ultimately the termination letter.
 I accept Ms Poniatowska's evidence that the response of Ms Sharrad, when Ms Poniatowska expressed to her some concern about being assigned to work with Mr Lotito, was made in a public environment in a robust setting.
