 If your client has documents which [the applicant] is seeking but which have not been discovered in the arbitration, please let us know if your client will agree to produce those documents.
 First, the first respondent submits that the application in this Court was unnecessary, in the face of the existing arbitration, as the applicant could have brought (and ultimately did bring) its claims under the TP Act in the arbitration.
 The fact that the applicant could, and ultimately did, pursue its claims under the TP Act in the arbitration does not, in my view, make its application to this Court either unnecessary, or inappropriate.
 The fact that the arbitration was then on foot, and that any contemplated claims under the TP Act against the first respondent might have been (and were) brought within the arbitration does not diminish that entitlement.
