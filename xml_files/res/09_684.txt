 The question is whether s 30C of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ("the Act") has the effect of requiring that payment to be offset against the war service pension Mr Smith was receiving when he recovered the payment as the fruits of an action which he had brought at common law.
 No interest shall be payable in respect of the judgment if payment is made within 28 days from either:- a. the date of Judgment; or receipt of an original Authority to Receive satisfactory to the Defendant; or receipt by the Defendant of advice or notice in writing from Centrelink, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service of any amounts due; whichever is the latter.
 The Memorandum recited; 'Division 4 of Part IV of the Veterans' Entitlements Act provides that compensation payments and damages recoverable at law, whether from the Commonwealth or otherwise, should be offset against any pension payable for the same injury disease or death for which compensation or damages is paid.
