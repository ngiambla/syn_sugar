 Section 601FJ provides: (1) Despite anything in this Division, the company named in ASIC's record of registration as the responsible entity or temporary responsible entity of a registered scheme remains the scheme's responsible entity until the record is altered to name another company as the scheme's responsible entity or temporary responsible entity. (2) A purported change of the scheme's responsible entity is ineffective unless it is in accordance with this Division.
 Section 601FP provides that on an application under s 601FL or s 601FN , the Court may, by order, appoint a company as the temporary RE of a registered scheme if the Court is satisfied that the appointment is in the interest of the members.
 Likewise, if, as AOL alleges, the purported removal of AOL and the choice of Huntley to be the new RE in its place were not carried out in accordance with s 601FM , the removal and replacement would be ineffective.
