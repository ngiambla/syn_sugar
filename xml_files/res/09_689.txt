 The outcome would have been the same (at [116]). (o) The appellant was not, because of the disability imputed to her by the Council, treated less favourably than, in circumstances that were the same or were not materially different, the Council would have treated a person without the disability.
 Indeed the Council would not have treated the appellant less favourably if she were without the disability that had been imputed to her (at [116]). (p) The termination of the appellant's appointment was not unlawfully discriminatory pursuant to s 15(2)(c) of the Act (at [117]).
 Whilst the learned Federal Magistrate found that, on the basis of Ms Nolan's investigation report of 30 April 2006, the Council imputed to the appellant a personality disorder 'of some kind' it does not follow that, on learning of that report, the Council imputed to the appellant a disorder that affected the appellant's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that resulted in disturbed behaviour within the meaning of paragraph (g) of the definition of disability in the Act.
