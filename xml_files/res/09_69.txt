 As the Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner it was not necessary for it to consider whether she would face persecution in China by reason of her practice of Falun Gong should she return.
 Further, the appellant says that she was not put on notice as to the critical issues for the purposes of the review and that it was not apparent from the delegate's decision what were likely to be issues on the review.
 The first respondent submitted that where the issues had been squarely raised with the appellant at the first hearing, the appellant may be taken to have been put on notice of the issues arising in relation to the review.
 The Tribunal gives weight to the Applicant's claim that she only decided to claim protection in Australia after she witnessed Falun Gong practitioners doing exercises in Sydney, after she came to Australia for another purpose, which other purpose she then went on to pursue.
