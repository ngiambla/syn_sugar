 Markethaven alleges that the expert advisory group did not find that there was an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury, and did not recommend a product recall of products manufactured and/or supplied by Pan.
 Markethaven alleges that, by reason of the foregoing, it was unable from 28 April 2003 to obtain supply of, and therefore distribute, Pan's products, and consequently suffered a catastrophic loss of business and revenue.
 The Suspension Notice and the Recall Notice were issued to Pan during a meeting between representatives of Pan and of the TGA that took place at Pan's premises in Sydney, New South Wales, on 28 April 2003.
