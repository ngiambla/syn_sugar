 Indeed Target itself issued a letter to all shareholders responding to the further extension of offer lodged by Blaze on 11 June 2009, extending the offer period to 17 July 2009, recommending that the offer be rejected and that shareholders do nothing.
 By analogy, counsel for Target contends, assuming that order 2 is made, s 1322(4)(d) of the CA does not permit the re-establishment of the offer contained in the SBS when that offer expired because of the very terms of the SBS.
 What Blaze now asks the Court to do is make an order permitting it to lodge a notice under s 650D(1) that would achieve, in substance, what the purported notice of variation lodged with ASIC on 11 June 2009 would have achieved if the SBS had been regularly lodged.
 If this is the case, this time for payment would be affected by the remedial orders sought and, in ASIC's view, it would be preferable for Blaze to be required to offer withdrawal rights (or accelerated payment terms of equivalent effect) to those accepting shareholders affected, in addition to Blaze immediately declaring the bid unconditional.
