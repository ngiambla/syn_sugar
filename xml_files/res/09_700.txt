 Subsection 11(2) of the OHS Act very deliberately excludes the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities (other than Government business enterprises) from liability for prosecution for an offence under the Act.
 The death of Nathan Francis exposed systemic faults involving the procedures and policies relating to the supply and permitted consumption of foodstuffs that might contain food allergens, namely Combat Ration Packs, to food allergic persons.
 In oral submissions Mr Livermore explained that the Commonwealth accepted liability for contravention of the Act and also accepted that the contravention was a serious breach of the duty imposed by the Act.
 I infer from the change in the Scotch College medical form for use in the 2007 enrolment that the school was aware of the peril of anaphylaxis to people suffering food allergy.
