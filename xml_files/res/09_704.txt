 As stated in its outline of submissions dated 28 August 2007, SMS contended that there were three fundamental deficiencies in the case pleaded by Dr Windsor: (1) that Dr Windsor did not have a cause of action against SMS in contract, (2) that the claim advanced under the Trade Practices Act was time barred; and (3) that Dr Windsor did not propose to advance part of her pleaded case.
 I'm not going to deduct 50% of the pay like the tax department want us to do. ' It was submitted on behalf of Dr Windsor that it is inappropriate in a summary judgment application to determine the question of law whether post-contractual conduct or communications can be used to identify the parties to the contract for the provision of medical services entered into by SMS.
 I am also conscious that if Dr Windsor is ultimately successful in establishing that the relevant contract was between herself and SMS and not InterNEOn and SMS then this will give rise to significant adverse income tax consequences for her having regard to the way in which income was returned by herself and InterNEOn for the relevant years of income.
