 Blake Dawson also stated that in the days leading up to the termination of his employment at Total, Mr Iannello had access to a new agreement between Total and BP executed in June 2008.
 Specifically, Darren Iannello emailed Giovenco on 28 May 2008, forwarding client details and information to Giovenco, and asking Giovenco to provide quotes on work that had been referred to Darren Iannello as an employee of TCC, for the purpose of obtaining a quote from TCC.
 The applicants' evidence on this issue does not give rise to a reasonable cause to believe that Mr Iannello used or threatens to use confidential information, or may have done so, in his dealings with BP.
 The evidence of Mr Kua and Mr Newton establishes that before the meeting Mr Iannello made known that he was working for Giovenco and that the purpose of the meeting was to introduce Giovenco to BP.
