 On 19 September 2007, so Mr Pakula deposes, he informed Mr Mario Zacaropoulos that, "because of persistent and flagrant breaches of our agreement", he was "terminating his rights to produce and sell Pakula Lures".
 He told Mr Mario Zacaropoulos that he wanted: (a) return of "my" capital equipment used to manufacture lures; (b) money owed for stock used and royalties; and (c) that "he" cease using any equipment, stock and intellectual property of "Pakula Tackle Australia".
 The oral and written submissions made on behalf of both Pakula Tackle and Zacatak in respect of trade mark law pertinent to whether there existed a serious case to be tried in respect of infringement were noteworthy for their generality.
