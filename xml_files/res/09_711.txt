 In the notice of withdrawal filed in the Court on 4 December 2008 Mr Mapleston indicated that the appellant's last known address for service was care of Longreach Australia Pty Ltd, Level 6, 409 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.
 In this case the appellant has, since the withdrawal of Mr Mapleston, no address for service and hence the proper address for her under O 7 r 4(2) includes her last known place of business, namely Level 6, 409 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.
 Alternatively, that address might be viewed as the appellant's last known address for service, in which case the terms of O 7 r 4(2) would similarly apply.
 WANT OF PROSECUTION Order 52 rule 38(1)(a) provides that an appeal may be dismissed for want of prosecution where the appellant has not, inter alia, prosecuted the appeal with due diligence.
