 The mortgage origination and securitisation business of the trust is in run off and it is estimated that the run off period will occupy approximately five years.
 The liquidators consider that the preferable means by which to transfer control of the financial facilities and securities to the new trustee is to execute the power of attorney and the deed of acknowledgement.
 The liquidators have satisfied themselves that: The power of attorney which is the subject of the present application is an irrevocable power of attorney and will survive the company's deregistration.
