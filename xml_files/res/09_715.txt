 INTRODUCTION In these proceedings, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("the Commission") claimed that a number of large well-known companies entered into arrangements in 2001 and 2002 which had the purpose or effect, or likely effect, of substantially lessening competition in markets for the supply of automotive terminals at ports in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.
 In or about June or July 2001, senior executives of Patrick and PO met to discuss a proposal to share PO's Glebe Island Motor Vehicle terminal in Port Jackson and Patrick's Webb Dock East terminal in the Port of Melbourne as a prelude to the establishment of the AAT joint venture.
 Therefore as at November 2002 in Port Jackson, having regard to the fact that Patrick and PO were the only suppliers of automotive terminal services prior to the Arrangement, and the substantial barriers to entry, the Arrangement was likely to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition in the Sydney terminal services market.
 The making and giving effect to that arrangement, as at November 2002, had the likely effect of substantially lessening competition in each of the following markets: 44.1 Sydney terminal services market; 44.2 Melbourne terminal services market; and 44.3 Brisbane terminal services market within the meaning of sub-sections 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45(2)(b)(ii) of the Act.
