 The cost of hiring videoconference facilities for the estimated duration of the cross-examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses was less than 15% of the total cost of bringing them to Australia. (5) StoresOnline is prepared to make all necessary arrangements and bear the cost of making those arrangements for the effective taking of the evidence of the Cooling Off Witnesses via a videoconference facility or facilities.
 On the other hand, as senior counsel for the ACCC pointed out, it was significant that there was no evidence that any of the Cooling Off Witnesses are not prepared to come to Sydney for the time they are required during the hearing. (4) That for a full week, StoresOnline's business would be completely compromised in the United States by the loss of an entire sales team.
 But if the court can anticipate that the cross-examination of the witness will be lengthy and complex, and that the credit of the witness will be challenged, that combination of factors is likely to persuade the court against audiovisual evidence unless there is a good reason for choosing it (such as, for example, a large difference in costs or the illness of the overseas witness).
