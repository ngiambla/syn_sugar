 On 17 December 2007 Diakyne gave notice terminating the Colorado contract (assuming it had not already been terminated by the events of 4 December 2007 during which the shareholders of Diakyne resolved to remove Mr Ralph from his position as a director).
 The minutes noted that the future role of Mr Ralph and the Colorado contract were "for urgent consideration" but that these issues "may be totally or partially resolved with the termination of Paul Ralph".
 The letter said that, if the Colorado contract were valid and enforceable, then Diakyne was entitled to terminate the contract without notice pursuant to cl 4.3(b) on the basis of alleged grave misconduct by Mr Ralph.
 Mr Ralph intended to and in fact gained an advantage for Colorado by ensuring Colorado received the money without Diakyne having any opportunity to debate or dispute the making of the payment.
