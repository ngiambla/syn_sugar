 The judge deciding a case under s 51AA will be asking himself or herself whether he or she would have been prepared to grant relief at equity on the basis of an assessment of the conduct in question as unconscionable. " Although the application of the principles in that case to a particular circumstance of special disadvantage on the part of a shopping centre tenant was overturned by a Full Court the principles were not impugned --- see CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2001] FCA 757 ; (2001) 185 ALR 555.
 This it did. (c) Insofar as questions of limitation periods and entitlement to relief arise in relation to the unconscionability claim, Telstra was content that those issues be addressed at the second stage of the hearing should the Court find, contrary to the submissions made above, that Telstra has in fact engaged in unconscionable conduct.
 While the Full Court itself acknowledged the list may not be exhaustive, the fact that the terms of the Access Agreement were ultimately concluded in the way they were such that the conduct of Telstra which is impugned in this case was found to be a breach of contract would suggest that Optus was not only aware, which it undoubtedly was, that Telstra would have access to Optus' traffic information but that its disadvantage in this respect --- it did not have access to Telstra's traffic information --- was nevertheless counter-balanced by the restrictions on the use and disclosure of such information.
