 On 30 January 2009, subsequent to the filing of the notice of appeal, the applicant forwarded a letter to the solicitors for the first respondent, with a copy to the Court, stating, amongst other things, that the applicant "would like to withdraw my case", and was waiting for a reply from the Court.
 The solicitors for the first respondent wrote to the applicant on 4 February 2009 stating that the solicitors noted the applicant's wish to withdraw from the proceedings and that, in order to do so, it would be necessary for either a notice of discontinuance to be filed or for consent orders to be executed.
 The first respondent seeks an order that the application be dismissed pursuant to Order 35A r 2(1)(f) of the Federal Court Rules , namely, that the applicant has failed to prosecute the proceedings with due diligence with the consequence that the applicant is in default, and so that the Court may dismiss the proceedings under Order 35 r 3(1)(a).
