 Relevantly, s 21(2)(b) provides that the person must be a permanent resident at the time the person made the application and at the time of the Minister's decision on the application.
 Section 22(5) provides that, for the purposes of s 22(1)(c), the Minister may treat a period as one in which the person was present in Australia as a permanent resident if the Minister considers the person was present in Australia during that period but, because of an administrative error, was not a permanent resident during that period.
 Thus, under s 22(6), a person may be treated as having been present in Australia, as a permanent resident, even though the person was not a permanent resident during the relevant period.
