 Section 440C of the Corporations Act provides: 440C During the administration of a company, the owner or lessor of the property that is used or occupied by, or in the possession of, the company cannot take possession of the property or otherwise recover it, except: (a) with the administrator's written consent; or (b) with the leave of the Court.
 The administrator must convene a meeting of the company's creditors within eight business days of the beginning of the administration in order to determine whether to appoint a committee of creditors: s 436E.
 The giving of the notice of termination could not ipso facto mean that DNPW could not enter into a DOCA which assumes relief from forfeiture or an order under s 444F.
 The Court is also empowered to make an order preventing an owner or lessor of property that is used or is occupied or in the possession of the company from taking possession of the property or otherwise recovering it: s 444F(4).
