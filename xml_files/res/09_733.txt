 The applicant and the Minister agreed that, by reason of s 499 of the Migration Act and the terms of Direction 21, the Tribunal was required to consider "the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community" (paragraph 2.3(a) of Direction 21).
 The applicant also accepted that the Tribunal correctly identified for itself the primary relevant considerations specified in paragraph 2.3 of Direction 21 and that the Tribunal was required to consider, amongst other things, general deterrence by reference to paragraph 2.11 of that Direction (at [101]-[103]).
