 The evidence is that a person voting online in the ballot will be required to enter his or her name and employee identification number on the online voting form in order to vote.
 Accordingly, say the applicants, there will have been a failure to satisfy the requirements of s 340(2)(a) of the Act and, in those circumstances, any subsequent steps taken to lodge the collective agreement will be in contravention of the Act.
 The applicants say that the absence of "reasonable opportunity" arises from the fact that employees are likely to be misled as to whether the collective agreement, the subject of the ballot, is a non-union or union collective agreement.
