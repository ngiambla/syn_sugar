 The matter of giving leave for SFG to proceed with the Supreme Court proceeding against Willow Glade and Pazoluca (see s 471B of the Act) will be able to be dealt with by that Court.
 Mr Feldman has at times expressed to Mr Bamford a desire to move with his family away from Sydney to live in order to mitigate the ramifications of his problems for his family.
 SFG asked for an order that it be at liberty to use Mr Bamford's affidavit in the Supreme Court proceeding and I made an order to that effect on 7 July 2009.
