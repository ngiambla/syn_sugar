 The relevant freezing order also provided that if the unencumbered value of the second respondent's Australian assets was less than the said amount and he had assets outside Australia, he was also restrained from disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of his Australian assets and his ex-Australian assets up to the unencumbered value of the said amount.
 In paragraph 6(1)(c)(ii) of the freezing orders against the first respondent his assets were defined as including '[t]he sums of US $32,142.56 and AUD $14,263,136.36' held in the same ten bank accounts in New Zealand in the name of the fifth respondent.
 Once again the freezing orders extended to assets outside Australia in the event that the unencumbered value of the fourth respondent's Australian assets was less than the said amount in which case the restraint applied to both Australian and ex-Australian assets up to the unencumbered value of the said amount.
 Once again paragraph 6(1)(c)(ii) of the freezing order defined the assets of the fourth respondent to which the restraint applied as including 'the sums of US$32,142.56 and AUD$14,263,136.36' held in the ten bank accounts in the name of the fifth respondent to which reference has already been made.
