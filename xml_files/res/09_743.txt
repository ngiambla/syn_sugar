 On 10 March 2009, an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the Tribunal together with a draft notice of appeal and an affidavit sworn by Mr Hua on 9 March 2009 (Ex. 2) in support of the application for an extension of time were filed in the New South Wales registry of the Court.
 Next, the Commissioner contended that paras 2(a) to 2(j) of the amended draft notice of appeal 'did not disclose questions of law', by which I understand him to mean that they are not pure questions of law, even though they may 'involve' questions of law which, it is conceded by the applicant, is not sufficient to ground an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act.
 This paragraph does not raise a question of law on which to ground the appeal: Commissioner of Taxation v Perkins 93 ATC 4524 at 4526 (Davies J, with whom French and Heerey JJ concurred); Commissioner of Taxation v Glennan [1999] FCA 297 ; (1999) 90 FCR 538 at [80] --- [83] (Hill, Sackville and Hely JJ).
