 It is common ground that notice of any appeal from this decision was required to be filed in the appropriate registry of this Court by 16 December 2008: s 44(2A)(a) of the Administration Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act') and O 53 r 6(1) of the Rules; with a copy to be served on the Commissioner and the Registrar of the Tribunal within seven days after the filing: O 53 r 6(2) of the Rules.
 On 10 March 2009, an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the Tribunal together with a draft notice of appeal and an affidavit sworn by Mr Hua on 9 March 2009 (Ex. 2) in support of the application for an extension of time were filed in the New South Wales registry of the Court.
 Next, the Commissioner contended that paras 2(a) to 2(j) of the amended draft notice of appeal 'did not disclose questions of law', by which I understand him to mean that they are not pure questions of law, even though they may 'involve' questions of law which, it is conceded by the applicant, is not sufficient to ground an appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act.
 This paragraph does not raise a question of law on which to ground the appeal: Commissioner of Taxation v Perkins 93 ATC 4524 at 4526 (Davies J, with whom French and Heerey JJ concurred); Commissioner of Taxation v Glennan [1999] FCA 297 ; (1999) 90 FCR 538 at [80] --- [83] (Hill, Sackville and Hely JJ).
