 Following the first hearing on 2 June 2009, the liquidator (who had filed a submitting appearance) has reviewed the available materials including the transcripts of the public examinations, and has formed the view that the relief sought by the Commissioner is appropriate.
 The liquidator gave his consent under s 588R of the Corporations Act to the Commissioner, as a creditor of PAAN, beginning proceedings under s 588M in relation to PAAN's having incurred debts for payroll tax owed to the Commissioner.
 The Court had to consider whether the action proposed to be taken in the company's name had some arguable foundation; see also Christianos v Aloridge Pty Limited (1995) 59 FCR 273 at 281B-282B, 284A-B per Beaumont, Whitlam and Tamberlin JJ.
