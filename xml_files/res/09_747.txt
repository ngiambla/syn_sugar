 In consequence, on 3 June 2009, the applicant sought, and I granted, leave to the applicant to file notices of discontinuance in both proceedings which he did on 12 June 2009, subject to a claim for his costs in both.
 The applicant submitted that the Court should find that the grant of the s 195A visa upon a ministerial determination of an undisclosed 'public interest' occurred under the pressure of a Full Federal Court hearing on the constitutional validity of Item 7 of the amending statute.
 The Minister further submitted that the applicant's submission in [28] above, namely, '... that the grant of the s 195A visa upon a ministerial determination of an undisclosed "public interest" occurred under the pressure of a Full Federal Court hearing on the constitutional validity of Item 7 of the amending statute' should never have been made.
 The Minster's submission that the declaratory relief sought by the applicant was not rendered 'moot' by the grant of the s 195A visa is, in a juridical sense, correct; but as a practical matter, the grant of that visa rendered the declaratory relief sought futile.
