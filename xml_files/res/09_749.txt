 It is evident that from the allegations made in the proposed cross-claim (and from the terms and conditions of the June 2005 AMSLA, the February 2007 IPBA, the March 2007 IPBA and the November 2007 IPBA) that the proposed claim raises serious questions to be tried.
 Amongst other things, they say that the risk of inconsistency between findings made by this Court in relation to the applicants' claims against Merrill Lynch and findings made by the liquidators in their adjudication of a proof of debt, gives rise to the potential for significant prejudice to Merrill Lynch if they are not granted leave to file the proposed cross-claim.
 Merrill Lynch do not accept that if the applicants were to succeed that the measure of damages would be the marketable value of the relevant securities as at 10 April 2008 less the amounts outstanding to Lift under the relevant loans at that time.
 Same matrix of facts Merrill Lynch submits that it is evident from the matters pleaded in the statement of claim, the defence and the proposed cross-claim that the applicants' claims against Merrill Lynch and Merrill Lynch's claims against Lift arise out of the same matrix of facts.
