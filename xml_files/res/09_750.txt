 Moreover, the employer would not achieve another significant benefit that is obtained from the approval of an employee collective agreement, viz the agreement binding all future employees for the period of its operation.
 On this aspect, Mr Boyce submitted that the expression 'reasonable opportunity to decide' in s 340(2)(a) referred, in this matter, to the opportunity to cast a vote in the postal ballot conducted by Blue Star under s 340(2)(b)(i).
 Given all these circumstances, I consider that the obligation imposed on Blue Star by s 340(2)(a) in this case required it to provide an opportunity for all of the employees affected by the proposed agreement to meet together at the same time and place and discuss the proposed agreement as a group.
