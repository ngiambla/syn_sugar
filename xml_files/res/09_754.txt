 In addition, the parties relied on Radio 2UE's admissions of the contraventions, as acknowledgement of liability and co-operation with the Authority, its contrition and its commitment to improving its compliance program and continued introduction of measures to improve that program.
 Radio 2UE has given substantial attention to developing effective compliance programs since the contraventions and both it and the Authority consider that these will be effective in reducing the risk of future contraventions of the disclosure standard.
 They indicate that there was a significant failure of Radio 2UE to take proper and sufficient steps to ensure that Mr Laws, in fact, complied and continued to comply with the disclosure standard.
