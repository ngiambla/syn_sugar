 Unlike the 2003 ULLS Model Terms, the 2007 ULLS Pricing Principles did not contain indicative prices. 86 Telstra submits, first, that the 2007 ULLS Pricing Principles do not purport to apply retrospectively and have no operation in relation to the price of access in any period prior to 21 November 2007.
 When s 152AQA(6) requires ACCC to have regard to "the determination" it is referring to the determination that is in force at the time when the duty to have regard to it is enlivened. 450 Telstra characterises ACCC's process in arriving at the Adam LSS FD as "picking and choosing" as between the 2002 and 2007 LSS Pricing Principles.
 Again ACCC stated (at [191]) that it had considered the s 152CR(1) criteria and the 2002 and 2007 LSS Pricing Principles. 492 Similarly, ACCC concluded that the MNM charges should be backdated to 9 June 2005, being a date on which Adam and Telstra were negotiating the MNM charges.
