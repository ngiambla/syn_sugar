 The President was satisfied that this aspect of the complaint could be more appropriately dealt with through criminal proceedings under Queensland law and terminated this aspect of the complaint on that basis.
 The issues for consideration are: What is the nature of the application currently before the Court, the subject of the notice of discontinuance, and does s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act apply to it?
 For these reasons, I am satisfied that the application to allow further time under s 46PO(2) is not a representative proceeding within the meaning or application of Pt IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act .
