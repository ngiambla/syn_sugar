 Subsection 28(2) provides that a summons issued under subsection 28(1) must be accompanied by a copy of the determination by the ACC Board that the intelligence operation is a special operation, or that the investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation.
 The second respondent plainly had the power to issue the second summons (see s 33(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act ) and the fact is that, by mistake, the wrong time (that is, 1.00 am instead of 1.00 pm) was included on the first summons.
 As I have already said, s 24A of the Act provides that an examiner may conduct an examination for the purposes of a special ACC operation/investigation and s 28(7) provides that the powers conferred by the section are not exercisable except for the purpose of a special ACC operation/investigation.
