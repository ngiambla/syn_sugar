 The first respondent ( the ACC ) noted in its submissions that during the course of the hearing I in fact indicated that three issues of costs would be reserved.
 The order I made on 29 May 2009 omitted reference to the costs of a video-link during the hearing on 27 March 2009 when Andrew Cann of the ACC gave evidence.
 In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the ACC should have the benefit of a costs order in its favour with respect to the withdrawn application for leave to re-open.
