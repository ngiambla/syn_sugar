 The ACC's application to re-open, made during the hearing, was withdrawn in the face of SS's objection and my indication that an explanation for the late production would be required.
 In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that the ACC should have the benefit of a costs order in its favour with respect to the withdrawn application for leave to re-open.
 The remaining question in respect of this first issue is whether SS should have the benefit of any costs order in its favour in the circumstances identified.
