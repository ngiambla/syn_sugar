 MOORE J: This judgment concerns the question of whether the orders of a Full Court ( Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCAFC 71) and related orders should be stayed pending an application by the appellant, Mr Hogan, for special leave to appeal against the judgment of the Full Court.
 It is true that the Full Court, by majority, has determined that there was no miscarriage of the discretionary power of the primary judge to set aside the order under s 50.
 There is, however, a lengthy and reasoned judgment of a member of the Full Court reaching the opposite conclusion and, in those circumstances, there must be some prospect that the application for special leave will attract the grant of leave.
 The other area addressed by counsel for the interveners (media interests) concerns the nature of the loss the appellant might suffer if, effectively, the orders of Emmett J are not stayed.
