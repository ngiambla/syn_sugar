 The basis upon which this Court's jurisdiction was initially invoked was not self-evident, other than perhaps the reference in the Application as filed to the claim for interest pursuant to s 57 of the 1984 Act.
 But doubt as to whether this Court's jurisdiction has been properly invoked need not presently be resolved because the power to transfer a proceeding exists even where a question arises as to jurisdiction: cf Assad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039.
 Notwithstanding the careful written submissions advanced by Counsel for the Applicant, it is not considered that the proceeding involves any point of general importance, let alone a point which should be resolved by a single judge of this Court --- at least initially.
 Those points of general importance upon which Counsel for the Applicant sought to rely were to be found, so it was contended, not in the Statement of Claim but rather in the Defence --- a document not before the Court when the question of possible transfer to the Federal Magistrates Court was first raised.
