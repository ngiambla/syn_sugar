 The basis upon which this Court's jurisdiction was initially invoked was not self-evident, other than perhaps the reference in the Application as filed to the claim for interest pursuant to s 57 of the 1984 Act.
 But doubt as to whether this Court's jurisdiction has been properly invoked need not presently be resolved because the power to transfer a proceeding exists even where a question arises as to jurisdiction: cf Assad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1039.
 Notwithstanding the careful written submissions advanced by Counsel for the Applicant, it is not considered that the proceeding involves any point of general importance, let alone a point which should be resolved by a single judge of this Court --- at least initially.
