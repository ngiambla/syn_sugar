 As noted above, the third respondent and the applicant have agreed and the Court has ordered by consent that the third respondent's costs be secured up to the stage of mediation, generally speaking.
 In particular, they do not argue at this stage for security for preparation for trial during 2009, trial, all of the general care and conduct required in relation thereto, counsel's fees, or certain other disbursements associated with the final preparation for trial.
 It is this consideration --- in effect that the preparation for mediation will benefit from getting up, and that getting up will benefit the mediation --- that leads me to allow security to the point of entry.
