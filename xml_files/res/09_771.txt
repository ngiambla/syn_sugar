 In this instance, the applicant says that the seriousness arises out of the circumstances in which the injuries occurred and the nature of the injuries sustained to Dwyer, and to a much lesser extent, Gela.
 The respondent submits that the factual matters referred to support the view that the circumstances leading to the incident were an "aberration" of an otherwise safe system of work.
 Clause 5 provides that Comcare or an investigator may apply for a declaration or contravention or a pecuniary penalty order, but no one else is permitted to do so.
 While the parties are not agreed as to the appropriate range of penalty for contravention, the respondent does not contend that a pecuniary penalty is not appropriate and should not be imposed.
