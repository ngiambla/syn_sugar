 In my view the requirement in s 601FM , that the two matters be addressed at the same meeting, and that in s 601NE , are meant to ensure that members address both questions so that a scheme is not left without a responsible entity.
 However, if the scheme is listed, the responsible entity and its associates are entitled to vote their interest on resolutions to remove the responsible entity and choose a new responsible entity.
 In those circumstances, I conclude that neither the purported removal of City Pacific as responsible entity, nor the appointment of Trilogy as its replacement was invalid for non-compliance with that requirement.
 As I understand the BT defendants, they submit that it is just and equitable that an order be made validating any invalidity, and that no substantial injustice has been, or is likely to be, caused to any person.
