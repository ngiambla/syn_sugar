 On 22 May 2009, his Honour made further orders as follows: THE COURT ORDERS THAT: On or before 1 June 2009 the solicitors for the applicants and the fifth respondent hold a conference with a view to agreeing on any aspect of costs in relation to the proceedings.
 The fifth respondent file and serve by 4 pm on 5 June 2009 any evidence and submissions in respect of: (a) costs; and (b) the fifth respondent's proposal for the further conduct of the balance of the cases, including as to how to give effect to the agreement of the parties that is MF15, which is annexed hereto.
 Indeed, having programmed and having heard argument directed to determining what consequences (if any) for the other cases might flow from his Honour's reasons of 1 May 2009, his Honour expressly declined to decide the question and referred that question to mediation.
