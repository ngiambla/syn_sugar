 In Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Mateo [2003] FCAFC 26 ; (2003) 127 FCR 217 the Full Court of the Federal Court held that the effect of consent orders of the Family Court made under s 81 of the Family Law Act pursuant to which the Family Court ordered that the husband transfer his half interest in jointly-owned land to the wife was that the Family Court orders themselves vested in the wife all of the husband's equitable estate in the land.
 Section 35A of the Bankruptcy Act , introduced by the Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (Cth), permits the Federal Court to transfer proceedings to the Family Court on the application of a party to the proceeding or of its own motion.
 Further, in my view the current legislative framework applicable to financial agreements contemplates that a trustee in bankruptcy may make application pursuant to both s 120 and s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act in the Federal Court to set aside a transfer pursuant to a financial agreement executed by the parties.
