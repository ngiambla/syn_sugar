 If they do, the second step also involves determining whether the documents can be redacted or masked in such a way that, in their masked form, it will not be possible, even by the conveying of "a shrewd idea", to identify the informer or informers.
 Notwithstanding my ruling that the applicants are entitled to bring a further motion for production and inspection of the documents and transcripts, I must take into account, follow and apply the relevant and binding reasoning and ratio of the Full Court in its decision on 4 July 2008.
 I am satisfied that ASIC has discharged the evidentiary onus upon it to establish that the informer or informers, other than Mr Cummins, provided ASIC with information voluntarily and on a confidential basis and that the information provided had itself the requisite character of confidence.
 Consistently with the submissions of the applicants, I have felt an "actual persuasion" that the informer or informers provided ASIC with information, that they did so voluntarily, that it was on a confidential basis and that the information provided had itself the requisite character of confidence.
