 The applicant accepts that although it has achieved a substantially more favourable judgment than the terms of its offer of 27 May 2008, this is not sufficient in order to obtain the special costs order it seeks.
 I accept that it is clear that the offers by the applicant were far more favourable to the respondents than the ultimate result in the judgment of the Court.
 I also accept the applicant's submission that hindsight shows that it would have been a prudent choice for the respondents to have accepted one or other of the offers.
