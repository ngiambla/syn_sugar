 The respondent's delegate did not consider and determine these matters, even though she had a report from staff of the Australian Embassy in Manila that the appellant 'was employed as a cook prior to February 2006 on a non-continuing basis '".
 The ground or jurisdictional error raised before the Federal Magistrate was particularised on the basis that the delegate did not take into account the appellant's occupation as a cook with duties and responsibilities from his employer at the time of his application in making the delegate's determination of the application.
 As a matter of legal analysis, in order for the delegate to determine whether she was satisfied as to the nature of the employment of the appellant in the skilled occupation and that he had performed the duties of a cook it was necessary for the delegate to examine, consider and make a finding in respect of the period or periods during which the appellant had been employed in that occupation and performing those duties.
