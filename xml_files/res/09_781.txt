 The respondent's delegate did not consider and determine these matters, even though she had a report from staff of the Australian Embassy in Manila that the appellant 'was employed as a cook prior to February 2006 on a non-continuing basis '".
 The ground or jurisdictional error raised before the Federal Magistrate was particularised on the basis that the delegate did not take into account the appellant's occupation as a cook with duties and responsibilities from his employer at the time of his application in making the delegate's determination of the application.
