 The Federal Magistrate accepted Ms Xie's evidence that the appellant spoke in accurate Mandarin when giving short and simple answers and could express himself adequately in Mandarin when giving longer explanations.
 It would be unreasonable and contrary to the appellant's own evidence to expect the Tribunal to take from that exchange an understanding of the facts asserted by the appellant.
 It must be recognised (as the Federal Magistrate did at [65]) that the appellant made no objections to the interpretation provided and raised no concern with the Tribunal in that respect.
 As to the fifth alleged error, the Federal Magistrate provided reasons for rejecting the appellant's claim that he could not make himself understood by the Tribunal through the interpreter provided.
