 Mr Ingham says the work undertaken by the employees on the X50 work site is work carried out in relation to the matters described in Appendix 1 to the Agreement under the scope of works for X30.
 Mr Bradley also accepted that the entrance signs to the X25 work site refer only to the X25 Project and there is "no reference whatsoever to X30 anywhere" (T71, l 20).
 Mr Bradley and Mr Lowth said they sought entry to the X50 work site in reliance on the notices of 17 November 2008 and a contended right of entry under s 760 of the Act.
