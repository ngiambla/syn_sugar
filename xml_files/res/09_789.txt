 There has been a long history of engagement on the nature of the traditional and customary rights and interests of the Wik and Wik Way Peoples, their connection with their country and the practice over time of those traditional laws and customs.
 Specifically, Professor Sutton has given extensive consideration to the nature and content of the rights and interests possessed by the Wik and Wik Way Peoples under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by them, the continued acknowledgement and observance of those traditional laws and customs and the continued connection of the Wik and Wik Way Peoples to the land and waters of the main application and the land and waters the subject of the present application, through the practice of those laws and customs by the Wik and Wik Way Peoples.
 They must be possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by Aboriginal peoples; Aboriginal people by their law and customs must have a connection with the land or waters; and the native title rights and interests must be recognised by the common law of Australia.
 Regulation 4(1) of the Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 (Cth) ("the Native Title Regulations") provides that an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation is prescribed if it is registered for the purposes of being the subject of a s 57 determination.
