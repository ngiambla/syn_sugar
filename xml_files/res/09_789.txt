 There has been a long history of engagement on the nature of the traditional and customary rights and interests of the Wik and Wik Way Peoples, their connection with their country and the practice over time of those traditional laws and customs.
 They must be possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by Aboriginal peoples; Aboriginal people by their law and customs must have a connection with the land or waters; and the native title rights and interests must be recognised by the common law of Australia.
