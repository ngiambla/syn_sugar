 After considering all of his evidence and that of his half-brother, mother and former de-facto partner, the second Tribunal turned to Dr Banks' report, the same report that was prepared for the first Tribunal hearing.
 The second Tribunal referred to Mr Murdoch's assessment in May 2007 that Mr Aporo presented a high risk of re-offending but noted that Mr Aporo was looking at long-term residential rehabilitation services.
 The second Tribunal then considered the best interests of Mr Aporo's daughter and his nieces and nephew, as well as other considerations such as his ties with the Australian community, including his family ties.
 Mr Aporo complains about what he now describes as "the unfairness" of his interview with Ms Hunt because he was not forewarned as to the consequences of that interview.
