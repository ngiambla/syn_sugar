 On 24 July 2009 I made orders dismissing appeals brought by Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd (in liquidation), Mr Peter Tracy and Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement).
 At the request of the appellants on about 12 June 2009, the Court gave the appellants 14 days to determine whether the appeals were to proceed and, accordingly, the Court adjourned the settling of the appeal books.
 Reference was made to Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 , Davidova v Murphy [2009] FCA 601 at [23] and Khera v Jones [2008] FCA 548 at [24] .
