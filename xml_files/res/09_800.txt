 The primary estate group is the Elliott (Gurungu/Kulumintini) estate group who, in accordance with traditional law and custom are recognised to have exclusive and non-exclusive native title rights and interests within the claim area.
 The other fourteen neighbouring estate group members and their spouses, in accordance with their and the Elliott (Gurungu/Kulumintini) estate group's traditional law and custom are also recognised to have exclusive and non-exclusive native title rights and interests within the claim area.
 In relation to that part of the determination area where native title rights and interests are to be recognised to the exclusion of all others, the rights and interests are to be held by members of all of the fifteen estate groups.
 Satisfying the Court that it is appropriate for an order to be made should not be seen as the last hurdle to be overcome before the parties reach their ultimate goal of a consent determination of native title.
