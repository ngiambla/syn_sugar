 It is important to appreciate - and the reasons for judgment of the learned Federal Magistrate certainly evidence this - that the resolution of matters of factual controversy was a task consigned under our law in this type of case to the AAT, not to the judicial branch.
 Before me, Mr Doelle was concerned that the learned Federal Magistrate had not dealt with the special circumstances test correctly, in that, so he submitted, the court below had failed to appreciate that the ramification of the special circumstances test was that each case is different.
 When one reads the reasons of the learned Federal Magistrate insofar as they address the subject of the special circumstances aspect of the controversy which fell to the AAT to resolve one is left, in my opinion, with two impressions.
 Firstly, that the learned Federal Magistrate correctly apprehended the nature of the special circumstances test which fell for the AAT to apply, and secondly, that the learned Federal Magistrate did appreciate that that test fell for application in the circumstances of Mr Doelle's particular case.
