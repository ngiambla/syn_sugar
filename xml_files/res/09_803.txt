 In this action the plaintiffs alleged that a funded class action constituted a managed investment scheme which was required to be, but was not, registered under s 601EB of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth): s 601ED (MIS action).
 Now the defendants rely on the offer to argue they are entitled to have the costs, which will be awarded in their favour, taxed on a party and party basis up to 5 January 2009 and from then on an indemnity basis.
 First, there is the literal view of O 23 r 11(6) which is that if the rule is attracted, it "creates a presumptive entitlement in the respondent to indemnity costs after 11 am on the day after the offer was made": Review 2 Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1805 at [20] .
 On the one hand, there are cases which hold that "there should be a prima facie presumption ... that the party rejecting the offer should pay the costs of the other party on an indemnity basis from the date of the making of the offer": Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v Federal Airports Corporation (1996) 138 ALR 425 , 451.
