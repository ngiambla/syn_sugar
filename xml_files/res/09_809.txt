 THE ISSUE The issue now before the Court is whether either of the two proposed applications should be the subject of a direction by the Court to a registrar to issue the application to commence the proceeding.
 The Court found it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the application (at [9-13]), and that there was no reasonable prospect of the applicant successfully prosecuting his claim for damages (at [14-17]).
 It will immediately be appreciated that "the other" $514,000.00 is a reference to the initial claim made in the 2005 Centrelink proceeding for $520,000.00, less the $6000.00 settlement received following mediation in that proceeding.
 The action proposed would be a private damages claim against a Federal Court Judge concerning his conduct in the performance of his duties as a Federal Judge under Chapter III of the Australian Constitution .
