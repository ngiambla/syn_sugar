 That application was more in the form of an outline of submissions which appeared to suggest the following five grounds of review: (a) the Tribunal failed to "deal with an integer" of the appellant's claims being that his friend organised his trip to Australia (paras 4 to 7 of the application).
 The Federal Magistrate considered that this ground of review was in substance seeking impermissible merits review (at [13] to [11] at AB 19); (c) the Tribunal failed to give reasons and make a genuine attempt to consider the appellant's claims fairly in relation to his escape from his work and China (paras 12 and 13 of the application).
 Ground 1 in effect invites the Court to undertake merits review of the Tribunal's decision, which is not its function: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] ; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang Ors (1996) CLR 259.
