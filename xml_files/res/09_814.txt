 The Tribunal concluded that there was no plausible evidence before it that the appellant has suffered or will suffer persecution because of his political opinion, his imputed political opinion, because he is a member of a particular social group or for any Convention reason, from Chinese police/authorities or anyone else in the country, either now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, if he returned to China.
 The Federal Magistrate held that the Tribunal had addressed this issue and merely came to conclusions adverse to the appellant (at [11] to [13] at AB 18 to 19); (b) the Tribunal's decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have made it (paras 8 to 11 of the application).
 The Federal Magistrate considered that this ground of review was in substance seeking impermissible merits review (at [13] to [11] at AB 19); (c) the Tribunal failed to give reasons and make a genuine attempt to consider the appellant's claims fairly in relation to his escape from his work and China (paras 12 and 13 of the application).
 The Federal Magistrate held that there was no information to which these sections would relevantly operate in the appellant's case and, even if the sections did apply and had been breached, he would exercise his discretion not to grant relief (at [18] to [19] at AB 20 to 21).
 Further, it should be noted that if the appellant is claiming that the failure to act according "to substantial justice and the merits of the case" amounted to a breach of s 420 of the Act, such a failure would not in any event constitute a jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611.
 Allegations of bias and lack of good faith must be distinctly made and clearly proved ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Jia [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507) , and rarely will bias on the part of the Tribunal be apparent from the written reasons only ( SBBF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 358).
 Nor does a fair reading of the Tribunal's decision disclose a lack of an honest or a genuine attempt by the Tribunal to make a decision, including in the conduct of its review ( NAAG of 2002 v Minister for Immigration Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2002) ALR 207).
 Ground 1 in effect invites the Court to undertake merits review of the Tribunal's decision, which is not its function: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at [67] ; Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang Ors (1996) CLR 259.
 GROUND 2: THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER S 425 OF THE ACT The appellant has particularised this ground with the claim that there is no evidence that the Tribunal gave him genuine opportunity to present arguments in relation to the Tribunal's finding at para [46] of its decision.
 It found that the oral evidence given by the appellant was inconsistent, and that there was no plausible evidence that the appellant had suffered or will suffer persecution because of his political opinion, or his imputed political opinion.
