 His Honour also found that, in any event, whether or not the Tribunal relied on particular information at its disposal was a matter for it as part of the reasoning process associated with making its decision.
 His Honour further noted that, in any event, it was apparent from the Tribunal's decision that it paid considerable regard to the evidence given by the appellant at various stages of his protection visa application process, including the material contained in his response to the s 424A notice.
