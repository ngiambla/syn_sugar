 The only explanation given by Counsel for the applicant for this error was that perhaps he had not analysed the 2007 figures as accurately as he could have, but that in any event turnover for that period still appeared to be less than $2 million whereas representations had been made by Mr Cartan and Ms Cooley that the turnover should be $3 million (TS p 40 ll 19-20).
 Further, I note that, notwithstanding the provision by Mr Walsh in his affidavit of the 2005 and 2006 financial statements of the first respondent, Mr Walsh did so notwithstanding apparent instructions from Mr Cartan that no material beyond the 2007 financial statements be provided to the applicant (affidavit of Joe Walsh para 16).
 There is no evidence that any inquiries were made of the first, second, third and fourth respondents, or indeed anyone else. "All reasonable inquiries" in O 15A r 6(b) prescribes an objective standard ( Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Eli Lilly Australia Pty Ltd [1996] FCA 391 , [1996] FCA 1500 at [41] ).
