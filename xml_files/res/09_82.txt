 But even in that circumstance there may be cases in which it is felt that the client whose application it is should not have to suffer for his or her counsel's deliberate decision.
 Termicide's submissions go so far as to raise a question as to whether or not Grantigard made a deliberate tactical decision not to call evidence in relation to penetrations and for that matter whether penetrations of the Termiglass barrier are in any way an issue in the proceedings.
 It seems to me that these criticisms go more to the weight that one might ultimately give to Mr Gabriel's evidence overall, than whether or not it is relevant, and further, whether or not leave to re-open ought to be given.
 The terms of that grant of leave are that I am disposed to permit Granitgard to call Mr Gabriel to give evidence as contained in his affidavit, subject to such objections, if any, as may be made to it upon the tender of that affidavit.
