 REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner who had practised Falun Gong in China or Australia, as it did not accept that the appellant was a witness of truth.
 The Tribunal found that the appellant's knowledge of Falun Gong was not commensurate with the period of time she claimed to have practised Falun Gong as well as inconsistencies both in her evidence to the Tribunal and between the evidence given to the Tribunal and her original protection visa application.
 Her Honour found (at [23]) that "the generally expressed contention in ground one of the application for review does not establish that this is such a case or that the Tribunal findings on credibility should on that basis be disturbed (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 74 ALJR 405 at [67] )".
