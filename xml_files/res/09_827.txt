 This is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 8 April 2009 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) of 24 June 2008.
 The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship who formed the view that the appellant is not a person to whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 , amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees 1967 (Convention) and accordingly refused to grant a protection visa on 10 December 2007.
 The Tribunal found that the appellant's knowledge of Falun Gong was not commensurate with the period of time she claimed to have practised Falun Gong as well as inconsistencies both in her evidence to the Tribunal and between the evidence given to the Tribunal and her original protection visa application.
