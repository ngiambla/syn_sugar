 This is an appeal against an order of the Federal Magistrates Court of 17 October 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal in connection with refusal of a protection (class XA) visa under s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ( SZLML v Minister for Immigration Anor [2008] FMCA 1219).
 In SZLXI (2008) 103 ALD 589 ; [2008] FCA 1270 Cowdroy J held that the exceptions in s 424A(3) must apply to s 424AA as that section is merely an alternative method of providing appellants with information.
