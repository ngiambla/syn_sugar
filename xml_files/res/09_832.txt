 Mr Fletcher explains that all documents described in the affidavit of discovery and listed in items 19 to 47 referred to in the first paragraph of the motion below were correspondence in relation to attempted resolution of the investors' disputes. 'Without prejudice' privilege is claimed to preclude inspection.
 A second ground of objection raised for Devere and Packham to the production of this documentation was that 'without prejudice' privilege is a joint privilege and a purported waiver by one party is insufficient: Quad 27 FCR 86 at 93 per Hill J.
 Devere and Packham complain that it is difficult to understand the precise period of time with respect to which the applicants seek documents and it is confusing also as to whether the applicants seek documents relating to the particular clause itself or whether the applicants are seeking discovery of documents relating to whether effect was given to the clause.
 In any event, the position for Devere and Packham is that unless they have a completely erroneous understanding of the category of documents on which discovery is sought, the only documents that there are have been discovered.
