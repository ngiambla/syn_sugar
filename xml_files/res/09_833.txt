 At the time that Mr Ley consented to act as Mr Fernando's tutor in this proceeding, he did not condition his consent to act as a tutor on the basis that the respondents not seek to recover costs from him personally if Mr Fernando was unsuccessful in his claim.
 Mr Ley deposed that, at the time of giving consent to act as Mr Fernando's tutor in this proceeding, he did not seek any assurance from the respondents that they would not proceed against him personally for costs because it did not occur to him that the respondents may seek to recover costs from him personally.
