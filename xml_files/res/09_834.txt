 THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS The power of the Court to make a determination of native title in circumstances where the parties reach agreement is contained in s 87 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act).
 Moreover from my experience with the native title list in the Northern Territory, all of the legal practitioners and the parties they represent appear to be willing to progress the matters in the list in a co-operative manner, as quickly and efficiently as possible.
