 Siam argued that s 269TAE(2B) provided guidance for determining whether material injury might be threatened in the sense that the threatened injury had to be considered against such changes in circumstances as would make the injury "foreseeable and imminent" unless dumping measures were imposed.
 Those bases were, relevantly, a change in circumstances being either of one or more variable factors or other circumstances that, in the absence of the anti-dumping measures, would have the consequence that the Minister could not publish at that time a notice under s 269TG(2).
 The purposes of the Act and the Dumping Duty Act involved the legitimate, principled and limited imposition of dumping duty, in accordance with the tests in those Acts, to perform Australia's obligations (to the extent that the Parliament gave these effect in that legislation) under the implementation agreement.
 The purpose of the anti-dumping measures, identified in s 269TG(2) is to address material injury and threatened material injury to the Australian industry producing like goods to those which are being sold at dumped prices in the Australian market, caused or likely to be caused by the dumping.
