 The Tribunal put particular emphasis on the appellant's lack of knowledge of the main scripture of Falun Gong, relying on country information suggesting that all practitioners could be expected to know of this.
 The Tribunal considered the appellant's account of his time in Australia over the five months or more since his arrival, including his evidence about participation in a Falun Gong demonstration and practice sessions, but disregarded this conduct pursuant to s 91R(3) of the Act.
 The Tribunal stated (at [61]-[62]): The Tribunal concludes that he attended the demonstration on 10 May 2008 solely for the photo opportunity and not because he had an interest in the aims of the demonstrators.
 Accordingly, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee and so the Tribunal has disregarded his conduct in determining whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted in China for a Convention reason.
