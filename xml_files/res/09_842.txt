 The appellant appealed this decision, and on 6 June 2008 the Federal Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court, and remitting the matter to the Tribunal to be determined according to law.
 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution in China by reason of political opinion (actual or imputed) or any other Convention reason (AB 241, [75], AB 245, [94] --- [95]).
 The Tribunal did not accept that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, "including but not limited to actual and/or imputed anti-government political opinion and/or activity".
 The Tribunal, on the material before this Court, did not do or say anything to support a finding of actual or apprehended bias, and his Honour was correct to so find.
