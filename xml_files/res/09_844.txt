 The Minister submitted that the power given to the Minister pursuant to s 47 was not constrained by any obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants whose rights would be affected, indeed extinguished, by the giving of a notice pursuant to s 47.
 Prior to that time there had been numerous consultations and dialogue between the Minister and the representatives of the Housing Associations and the tenants but that was in relation to the proposal that the Housing Associations enter into 40 year sub-leases.
 I would point out that until the Minister raised the spectre of compulsory acquisition of the land on 24 May 2009 and for some time thereafter the Housing Associations were not prepared to enter into the sub-leases in the terms laid down by the Minister.
