 Mr Spencer has filed the application under s 471A of the Corporations Act as earlier mentioned, in effect, so as to seek permission or leave of the Court, to act as a director for the purpose of bringing an application for leave to appeal.
 The Court would then deal with the application for leave under s 471A of the Corporations Act to act as a director and in considering that application, the Court would take into account the matters raised in relation to the application for leave to appeal and would deal with that application, as the only purpose for the preliminary application is to deal with the application for leave to appeal.
