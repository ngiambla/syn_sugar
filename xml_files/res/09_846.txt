 In my opinion, upon the proper construction of the Trinbay DOCA there could not be a first and final dividend payment by Mr Gould to the Participating Creditors without an actual payment of money by him to them.
 As at 2 April 2003, the date of Mr Gould's letter to the ATO, there had been no payment of a Final Distribution or decision to pay a Final Distribution.
 On the contrary, there was a determination by Mr Gould, recorded in that letter, that the DOCA administration had concluded and that it was likely that Trinbay would be struck off.
 This meant that as at that date Mr Gould had determined that it was no longer practicable either to carry on Trinbay's business or to implement the DOCA within the meaning of cl 3 of the prescribed provisions.
