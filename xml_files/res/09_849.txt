 Further, it is argued that the Group B members' claim is not hypothetical because they could have no confidence that Allphones would act in accordance with the Court's decision in the proceeding if they do not remain members of the represented class.
 The Court observed that as the primary judge was exercising a discretion in considering whether the relevant paragraphs of the amended statement of claim should be struck out, the appellate Court was not to form its own view of the matter but rather to determine whether the discretion had miscarried.
 As in TS Production LLC [2008] FCA 1329 and as in Optiver [2008] FCA 47 , the more efficient and appropriate course, is to refer the application for leave to appeal to be heard by a Full Court of this Court.
 It is not for me to order that the appeal be heard by the Full Court but as in TS Production LLC , I will make an order that subject to any contrary direction of the Full Court, that course be pursued.
