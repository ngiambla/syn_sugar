 The Tribunal considered the appellant's response (as its reasons disclose) but concluded that the appellant was not a truthful or credible witness by reason of the contradictions and inconsistencies in and implausibility of many of the appellant's claims.
 Credibility findings are a matter for the Tribunal "par excellence" ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 ; [2007] HCA 1 at [67] ).
