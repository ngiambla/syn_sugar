 The Tribunal forwarded a letter to the appellant on the same date requesting comments on information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason or part of the reason for deciding that the appellant was not entitled to a protection visa (as required by s 424A of the Act).
 The Tribunal, by letter dated 8 May 2008, informed the appellant about a range of information that would be the reason or part of the reason for rejecting his claims and invited the appellant to comment.
 The Tribunal considered the appellant's response (as its reasons disclose) but concluded that the appellant was not a truthful or credible witness by reason of the contradictions and inconsistencies in and implausibility of many of the appellant's claims.
 Credibility findings are a matter for the Tribunal "par excellence" ( Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Durairajasingham (2000) 168 ALR 407 ; [2007] HCA 1 at [67] ).
