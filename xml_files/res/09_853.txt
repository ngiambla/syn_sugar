 During the period 23 November 2008 to 7 May 2009, the respondent supplied to retailers for sale to consumers in Western Australia, one kilogram blocks of matured cheese and one kilogram blocks of semi-matured cheese.
 During the period 23 November 2008 to 25 January 2009, the respondent also caused advertisements to be published in newspapers circulating in Western Australia advertising the availability for sale of the cheese.
 On 7 May 2009, the applicant commenced this proceeding against the respondent alleging that the respondent's conduct, in representing that the cheese was produced in Western Australia, when it was not, contravened s 52 and s 53(eb) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TP Act).
