 The characterisation of a claimant's acceptance of an amount of damages in s 95(2) as involving the settlement of a claim under the Motor Accidents Compensation Act is sufficient to bring the circumstances within s 17(3)(a) of the Social Security Act.
 Further, a payment made "in settlement of a claim", as referred to in s 17(3)(a)(i) is a payment made pursuant to, or in accordance with, the agreement by which the claim was settled.
 Accordingly, I agree with the Tribunal's conclusion that s 17(3)(a) requires a resolution of a claim by an agreement between the parties, irrespective of the form in which that agreement is given effect.
