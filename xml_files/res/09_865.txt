 The four officials held permits issued under Division 2 of Pt 15 of the Act and purported to exercise a right of entry to the X50 worksite under s 760 of the Act for the purpose of holding discussions with employees of John Holland performing work on the X50 worksite.
 Further findings were made that Mr Robinson and Mr Bradley engaged in conduct in contravention of ss 767(1) and 768(1) of the Act arising out of their entry to the X50 worksite on 5 March 2009.
 In proceeding QUD66 of 2009, the AMWU, the ETU and the CFMEU and Messrs Bradley, Lowth, Ong and Robinson sought declarations that John Holland had contravened ss 767(3) and 767(7) of the Act in hindering and obstructing the officials in their exercise of a contended right of entry to the X50 worksite on 19 November 2008, 13 February 2009 and 5 March 2009.
 Since s 71 elevates, upon intervention, the Commissioner to the position of a party and confers upon the Commissioner all the rights, duties and liabilities of such a party, the Intervener is entitled to make submissions on any of the questions in controversy on the footing that the Intervener is "taken to be a party".
 On 24 November 2008, Mr Sasse, John Holland's Group General Manager Human Resources Organisational Strategy, wrote to the CFMEU, the AMWU and the CEPU to set out the basis on which John Holland contended that the Unions and their officials had no right of entry to the worksite for occupational health and safety reasons.
 Mr Sasse noted that the officials had been told on at least four occasions on 19 November 2008 to leave the premises and that their conduct was hindering or obstructing John Holland employees.
 On 12 February 2009, John Holland's solicitors wrote to Mr Dettmer and the Secretary of the CFMEU and the Secretary of the CEPU in response to the entry notices of 10 February 2009 and 11 February 2009 and asserted that s 760 did not confer a right of entry to the premises in view of the Agreement ([109] and [110], primary judgment).
 On 4 March 2009, Mr Bradley (AMWU) served an entry notice on John Holland for entry to the X50 worksite on 5 March 2009 in reliance on s 760 of the Act.
 The officials might have determined, through discussions with John Holland and/or PCQ, or alternatively by invoking other procedures, whether in all the circumstances s 760 of the Act conferred a right of entry on the permit holders as they contended.
 In addition to that relief, John Holland sought the imposition of a pecuniary penalty in respect of conduct said to be in contravention of ss 767(1) and 768(1) of the Act which necessarily involved an examination of facts in controversy as to the events of entry.
