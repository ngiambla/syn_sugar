 Further findings were made that Mr Robinson and Mr Bradley engaged in conduct in contravention of ss 767(1) and 768(1) of the Act arising out of their entry to the X50 worksite on 5 March 2009.
 Mr Ong served such a notice on 10 February 2009 and Mr Robinson served a notice in similar terms on 11 February 2009, as a basis for entry to the premises on 13 February 2009.
 Reliance is placed on Inspector Cruse v CFMEU (2008) 175 IR 447 (the substantive proceeding) and Cruse v CFMEU (No 2) [2008] FCA 1637 (the penalty proceeding) as an example of contraventions of ss 298SC and 170NC of the Act by the CFMEU.
