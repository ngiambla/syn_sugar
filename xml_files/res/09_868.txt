 This dispute is between an Australian company, Bella Products Pty Ltd (BP), and a corporation established in Delaware, in the United States of America, Creative Designs International Ltd (CDI).
 That application was made out of time so the parties agreed (and in due course the Court ordered) that the Complaint be remanded to the Supreme Court of New York and that "defendant [BP] will not move to dismiss the complaint or assert a defence on lack of personal jurisdiction".
 Mr Watson of Messrs Middletons says that the order of remand does not represent a consent by BP to the jurisdiction of the New York court as BP and CDI did not enter into a forum selection agreement.
 As I read the order, BP concedes that the New York court has personal jurisdiction over it but does not accept that it is the appropriate court to deal with the dispute.
 The position in the United States appears to be that a court will recognise and enforce a right of action in tort (including an action on a statute) created by the law of the place where the defendant's conduct took place.
 This is the approach taken by both state and federal courts in the majority of states, including New York: see Hausman v Buckley [1962] USCA2 338 ; 299 F2d 696 (1962) ; Ackermann v Levine [1986] USCA2 271 ; 788 F2d 830 (1986).
 Each attorney refers to the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR), s 4511(b), which provides that "Every court may take judicial notice without request of... the laws of foreign countries and their political subdivisions.
 Returning to the narrative, prior to BP filing its answer, affirmative defence and counterclaim in the New York action, BP had instituted this action in the Federal Court.
 On 21 May 2009 CDI applied in the New York court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain BP from continuing to prosecute the Federal Court action pending resolution of the New York action.
 During the course of the hearing on 28 May 2009 BP told the New York court that its counterclaim in the New York action was based on a mistaken belief that the counterclaim was necessary to avoid an assertion of waiver.
 In TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd (2008) 172 FCR 433 , both at trial and on appeal, the Federal Court applied the Voth and Oceanic Sun Liner test in respect of an application for a temporary stay of an action pending in an Australian court when there was a similar action pending in a United States court.
 The correct test is that stated in Sterling Pharmaceuticals Pty v The Boots Company [1992] FCA 72 ; (1992) 34 FCR 287 , a decision affirmed by the High Court in Henry v Henry (1986) 185 CLR 571 at 590 and CSR Ltd v Signa Insurance Australia Ltd [1997] HCA 33 ; (1997) 189 CLR 345 at 390---398.
