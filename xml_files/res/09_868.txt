 This dispute is between an Australian company, Bella Products Pty Ltd (BP), and a corporation established in Delaware, in the United States of America, Creative Designs International Ltd (CDI).
 Returning to the narrative, prior to BP filing its answer, affirmative defence and counterclaim in the New York action, BP had instituted this action in the Federal Court.
 On 21 May 2009 CDI applied in the New York court for an anti-suit injunction to restrain BP from continuing to prosecute the Federal Court action pending resolution of the New York action.
 During the course of the hearing on 28 May 2009 BP told the New York court that its counterclaim in the New York action was based on a mistaken belief that the counterclaim was necessary to avoid an assertion of waiver.
