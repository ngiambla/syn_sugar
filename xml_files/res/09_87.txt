 Keycorp relies upon its letter of 4 August 2008 to HID which confirmed that it had an exclusivity arrangement with the other potential purchaser and its conduct in repeatedly rejecting the draft offers made by HID was wholly consistent with its stated attitude towards HID's offers.
 The evidence of Mr West also establishes that in the two weeks following 5 August 2008, meetings were held between the legal advisors of HID and Keycorp concerning the terms of a possible share sale agreement relating to the smartcard business.
 That is, whether it was reasonable to expect that it would ask its competitor to provide information which relates solely to a commercial transaction made between Gemalto and Keycorp, in respect of which HID was an unsuccessful bidder.
 The Court is not persuaded that it was reasonable for HID, a commercial competitor of Gemalto, to have made such inquiries of Gemalto concerning the existence of any exclusivity arrangement between Gemalto and Keycorp.
