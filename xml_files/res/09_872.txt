 EMAS argued that its cause of action was simply on a general maritime claim for towage or necessaries under ss 4(3)(j) or (m) of the Act and that its specification in its amended writ of those two heads of general maritime claim was sufficient to comprehend the proposed amendment.
 It argued that notwithstanding it was not aware of the Singaporean proceedings in rem until after it had amended the writ in these proceedings on 3 July, any claims that might arise under its charterparty with T-D were already comprehended in the proceedings that it had brought under the amended writ in this Court.
 That section contemplates that when an action in rem is commenced the, or a, maritime claim will be connected temporally by the coincidence of possession of a demise charterer who is liable and the cause of action asserted as a, or part of a, maritime claim.
 The amendment is not necessary for the purpose of determining any real issue in the proceedings between EMAS and APC Marine, though, had it been sought before the demise charter's termination there would have been a real issue with T-D as a relevant person.
