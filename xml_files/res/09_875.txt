 The DFRDB Act was amended at that time by the insertion of s 5A which had the effect that a person who became a member of the Defence Force after 1 October 1991 was excluded from eligibility under the DFRDB Scheme.
 By the operation of s 5A(1)(a) of the DFRDB Act and s 6 of the MSB Act, the respondent, in default of notification, became a member of and contributed to the MSB Scheme from 17 September 2003.
 The respondent submits that the Tribunal erred in law in finding that because he made no election as provided by s 61B of the DFRDB Act he became a member of the MSB Scheme.
 The Authority submits that the discretion exercised by the Tribunal to not seek the portion of the overpayment made to the Commissioner was based on a finding that was not supported by evidence.
