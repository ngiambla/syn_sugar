 The DFRDB Act was amended at that time by the insertion of s 5A which had the effect that a person who became a member of the Defence Force after 1 October 1991 was excluded from eligibility under the DFRDB Scheme.
 By the operation of s 5A(1)(a) of the DFRDB Act and s 6 of the MSB Act, the respondent, in default of notification, became a member of and contributed to the MSB Scheme from 17 September 2003.
