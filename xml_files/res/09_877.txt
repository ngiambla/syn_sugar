 I am unable to be satisfied on the evidence before me that, if the applicant returns to Bangladesh now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, there is a real chance that he will be involved in any form of political activity or that he will be persecuted (whether by the Awami League leader and his people, the Awami League more generally, the caretaker government or the army) for reasons of his real or imputed political opinion or for any other Convention reason.
