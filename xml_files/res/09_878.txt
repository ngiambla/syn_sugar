 On the application made by the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs, a federal magistrate held that the Tribunal had not fallen into jurisdictional error, and dismissed the application.
 The Tribunal member said that the particular social group which presented itself, having regard to the appellant's claim, was the appellant's family and that led to a consideration of s 91S of the Act.
 The Tribunal member concluded that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and she was not satisfied that the appellant came within Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention.
