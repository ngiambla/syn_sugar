 It provides that a provision is an exclusionary provision if it was between competitors and has the purpose of preventing, restricting or limiting the supply of goods or services to particular persons or classes of persons or particular persons or classes of persons in particular circumstances or on particular conditions.
 The significance of a finding that a provision is an exclusionary provision within s 4D and s 45(2)(a)(i) and (b)(i) is that such a finding engages a per se legislative prohibition.
 The period that the injunctions are to continue is not unreasonable: compare Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (2006) 157 FCR 162 at [233]-[234].
