 APPLICANT'S CONTENTIONS The applicant first draws attention to s 108-5(2) which provides: To avoid doubt, these are CGT assets: ... (c) an interest in an asset of a partnership; (d) an interest in a partnership that is not covered by paragraph (c).
 She points out that the headings in the Memorandum's explanation of what became s 152-30 --- Connected with --- control of a company or trust and Connected with --- control of a discretionary trust - indicate that the section as a whole is concerned only with those entities.
 For the reasons summarised above, the applicant submits that a contrary intention for the purposes of the definition of "entity" is shown to exist, so that that word does not include a partnership in relation to the maximum net asset value test in s 152-15.
