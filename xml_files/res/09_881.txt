 The Tribunal found that this addition to the narrative was prompted by the Minister's decision to switch sides from the UNP to the PA in January 2007.
 The Tribunal therefore did not accept that the appellant or his family had any political involvement in Sri Lanka, or that he or his father suffered any persecution as a result of their alleged involvement.
 His Honour stated that, the Tribunal had roundly disbelieved the appellant and had come to the conclusion that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution.
 The Tribunal did not accept that he could have been a close supporter of the candidate for four years and not have been familiar with his last name.
