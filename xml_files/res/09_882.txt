 Federal Magistrate Emmett correctly described the grounds of the amended application (at [33]) as an "unhelpful mixture of claims and submissions interspersed with bare assertions or error unsupported by relevant particulars. " Her Honour stated that, at the heart of the appellant's complaints, appeared to be a complaint that the Tribunal did not accept the veracity of his claims.
 Her Honour stated (at [40]) that, in failing to appear at the hearing, the appellant was taken to have assumed the risk that inconsistencies, omissions or other unsatisfactory features of his evidence would be considered by the Tribunal without an opportunity for him to explain or clarify them.
 Her Honour stated that, in those circumstances, he could not complain if his application was rejected because, amongst other reasons, he failed to take up the opportunity to appear.
 The first ground contends that the Federal Magistrate "simply endorsed" the decision of the Tribunal and that the Tribunal totally ignored the requirements of s 36(2) read with s 422B of the Act.
