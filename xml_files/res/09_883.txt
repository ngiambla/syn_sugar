 This was the case notwithstanding that Mr Cunningham well understood at all material times through July 2007 that, under the CARA, he required M3FS's approval of all documents he was required to give to clients as a representative of M3FS.
 Mr Cunningham says that at the meeting Jonathon Nguyen told him that Avoca and its representatives could start using the personalised SOA templates that Mr Cunningham had emailed to Dale Hare on 29 November 2007.
 Mr Nguyen says that he made it clear at the meeting on 4 December 2007 that Martin Cunningham was not to provide any SOA's to clients without those documents being pre-vetted by M3FS until further notice.
 Mr Barry Martin gave advice that confirmed the evidence of Ms Ruano and Ms Hare, and also confirmed the involvement and advice received from Ms Good concerning Avoca and Mr Cunningham.
