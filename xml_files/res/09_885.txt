 Also, at the relevant time, the fifth respondent, Lawrence Edwin Bowtell, was a director of Residential Investments and a director and secretary of the second and third respondents, namely, 122-136 Mason Street Pty Ltd and Riverdale Industries Pty Ltd.
 The applicants allegedly entered into contracts with these companies for the sale of land, and agent agreements pursuant to which Mason Street and Riverdale Industries were to engage a builder to build on the land.
 Also, according to the applicants' pleading, the applicants entered into a deed of undertaking with Mason Street and Riverdale Industries, in accordance with which the two respondent companies agreed to advance certain monies to the applicants.
 The applicants allege that Mason Street and Riverdale Industries are in breach of the undertaking because they "failed to advance to each applicant sufficient funds to meet until the Date of Completion ... interest on the loan made to each applicant by the relevant Bank to enable construction of the Dwelling in each case, which amount of interest has been paid by each applicant to each relevant Bank in each case".
 The applicants also claim that Residential Investments has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct contrary to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); and that Messrs Apperly and Bowtell are jointly liable for the contravention pursuant to s 75B of that Act "because they aided, abetted and/or were knowingly concerned in the contravention".
 The misleading and deceptive conduct is said to have been constituted by misrepresentations that: Mr Sullivan's first affidavit, the various affidavits of service on the court file and the court file establish that: None of the respondent companies has filed an appearance or defence.
 At the hearing of the motion, Mr Sullivan, who appeared for the applicants, informed the court that he had recently spoken with the legal representatives of Messrs Apperly and Bowtell about the hearing of the motion this day.
 Further, O 35A r 3(2) of the Rules provides that, if a respondent is in default, the court may: (a) order that a step in the proceeding be taken within the time limited in the order; or (b) if the claim against the respondent is for a debt or liquidated damages --- grant leave to the applicant to enter judgment against the respondent for the debt or liquidated damages and, if appropriate: (i) costs: (A) in a sum fixed by the court; or (B) to be taxed; and (ii) interest; or (c) if the proceeding was commenced by an application supported by a statement of claim or the court has ordered that the proceeding continue on pleadings --- give judgment against the respondent for the relief that: (i) the applicant appears entitled to on the statement of claim; and (ii) the court is satisfied it has power to grant; or (d) give judgment or make any other order against the respondent; or (e) make an order specified in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) to take effect if the respondent does not take a step ordered by the court in the proceeding in the time limited in the order.
 Instead, on the face of the statement of claim, there must be a claim for the relief sought and the court must have jurisdiction to grant that relief: see Arthur v Vaupotic Investments Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 433 at [3] per Heerey J; Diesel SPA v Hwang [2005] FCA 1619 at [2] per Tamberlin J; Wu v Avin Operations Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 36 at [57] per Kenny J; and HIT Entertainment Ltd v Lodin [2006] FCA 722 at [5] - [6] per Stone J.
 In some circumstances, although not here, it is appropriate to exercise some caution before granting relief: see Universal City Studios LLLP v Hoey t/as DVD Kingdom (2006) 232 ALR 525 at 527 [10] per Sackville J.
 I am also satisfied that, on the face of the amended statement of claim, the applicants appear entitled to the relief sought against them; and that the court has power to grant the relief.
