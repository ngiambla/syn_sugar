 The applicants allegedly entered into contracts with these companies for the sale of land, and agent agreements pursuant to which Mason Street and Riverdale Industries were to engage a builder to build on the land.
 The applicants allege that Mason Street and Riverdale Industries are in breach of the undertaking because they "failed to advance to each applicant sufficient funds to meet until the Date of Completion ... interest on the loan made to each applicant by the relevant Bank to enable construction of the Dwelling in each case, which amount of interest has been paid by each applicant to each relevant Bank in each case".
 The misleading and deceptive conduct is said to have been constituted by misrepresentations that: Mr Sullivan's first affidavit, the various affidavits of service on the court file and the court file establish that: None of the respondent companies has filed an appearance or defence.
