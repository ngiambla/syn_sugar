 Subsection (6) of s 501 provides that for the purposes of s 501 a person does not pass the character test if, relevantly, the person has a "substantial criminal record", as defined by subsection (7).
 Mr Rinka's submission is that jurisdictional error infected the Minister's decision because the Minister did not, in the exercise of her discretion, give proper, genuine and realistic consideration to the best interests of Mr Rinka's children.
 This expectation was created by the fact that the letter of 20 February 2006 notifying Mr Rinka of the Minister's intention to consider cancelling his visa stated that the decision-maker would have regard to the Direction in coming to a decision.
 As indicated earlier, although the Minister's statement of reasons does not say in terms that "the best interests" of Mr Rinka's children dictated that his visa not be cancelled, that is the effect of para 83.
