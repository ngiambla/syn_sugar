 The Tribunal's reasons for decision In its reasons for decision, the Tribunal devoted almost two pages of single-spaced text to summarising an exchange between the Tribunal member and the appellant's representative at the hearing.
 The Tribunal did not consider that the fact that the appellant may have been issued with a second identity card necessarily established that the second card was issued because he had been forcibly or otherwise required to convert to Islam.
 In the passage I have quoted at [9] above from the transcript of the Tribunal hearing, the applicant answered affirmatively several leading questions from the Tribunal member as to whether he had been forced to become a Muslim.
