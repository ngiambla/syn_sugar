 Section 425 requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review, except in certain circumstances.
 The Tribunal will have breached s 425 where it fails to notify the appellant of the determinative issues arising in relation to the decision under review ( SZBEL v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592).
