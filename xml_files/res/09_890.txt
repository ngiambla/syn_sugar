 Lowest limiting setting representation This is that the testing of SoundShield and M15D at their lowest limiting settings provided an appropriate comparative basis for testing for intelligibility of speech.
 Dynamic and Plantronics developed the M15D device during 2005 with a view to it competing in the Telstra and general markets for acoustic shock protection devices.
 In February 2008 Mr McNeill carried out a measurement of what he called the "acoustic limit for speech" for a M15D and a SoundShield, using a Plantronics H51N-TT3 headset.
 The s 52 contravention pleaded is that the lowest limiting setting at which SoundShield was tested was significantly lower than that for M15D, and the test results consequently conveyed a misleading assessment of the comparative performance capabilities of the SoundShield device.
 The lowest limiting setting is 80dB, and it was to the lowest limiting setting that the comparison report states that the device was set.
 More importantly, for present purposes, because a higher output could be achieved in different test conditions (with background noise), Mr McNeill's test is not a test of any limit of the M15D.
 It is true that SoundShield was set to its lowest limiting setting of 95dB and that M15D was set to its lowest limiting setting of 102dB.
 The admitted representation is that the testing of the two devices at their lowest limiting settings provided an appropriate comparative basis for testing for intelligibility of speech.
 The respondents relied on Mr Fisher's test of January 2006 to show that a 5dB difference in limiting in SoundShield MK1 had no effect on intelligibility in test conditions.
 Polaris has not established that the difference between the lowest limiting settings of the devices would have made M15D more intelligible than SoundShield.
 The representation was that the test was a properly conducted scientific test designed and undertaken with an appropriate level of skill, independence and expertise.
