 As to s 41(5), the Registrar's delegate formed the view that the evidence of Guylian's use of an image of the seahorse shape on its packaging did not demonstrate that the shape has been used as a trade mark.
 However, where an application for registration relies on use the question is whether the particular sign for which registration is sought has itself been used as a trade mark so as to become capable of distinguishing the relevant goods.
 However, once again, both the "Guylian" trade mark and the "G" trade mark feature significantly on the front of the boxes, which diminishes the trade mark significance the image of the seahorse shape might otherwise have.
