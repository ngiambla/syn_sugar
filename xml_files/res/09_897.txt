 This is an appeal against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing the appellant's application to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( the RRT ) for jurisdictional error ( SZINQ v Minister for Immigration Anor [2009] FMCA 469).
 The appellant's notice of appeal filed on 1 June 2009 identified four grounds of alleged jurisdictional error which the appellant said should have been found by Federal Magistrates Court to invalidate the RRT's decision.
 This last particular is a reference to the fact that the three earlier decisions of the RRT about the appellant's application had been set aside for jurisdictional error by consent orders in the Federal Magistrates Court.
 The particulars of this ground refer to the RRT incorrectly examining the appellant's inability to find a Shiite mosque in Sydney and assuming the appellant's claims were not credible.
 Further, that although the RRT particularly accepted the appellant's claims, the RRT did not give the "benefit of any ambiguity" the appellant and thus failed to take into account the appellant's claims to be a Shiite.
 Finally, the Federal Magistrates Court said that the appellant's contention that the RRT failed to take into account the appellant's claims to be a Shiite at all, assessed consistent with legal principle, became nothing more than a contention that the RRT made the wrong decision about the appellant's credibility but, if it did, that would not be a jurisdictional error in any event.
 On this basis, the Federal Magistrates Court was correct to characterise the appellant's allegation that the RRT failed to take into account at all his claims to be a Shia Muslim as an allegation only that the RRT erred in its judgment about the appellant's credibility, which (even if true) would not amount to a jurisdictional error.
 I appreciate that it is difficult for an unrepresented appellant to understand the difference between judicial review for jurisdictional error and a review of the merits of the RRT's decision.
 The jurisdiction of this Court on appeal is to correct error by the Federal Magistrates Court in its judicial review of the RRT's decision for jurisdictional error.
