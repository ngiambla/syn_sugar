 The particulars of this ground refer to the RRT incorrectly examining the appellant's inability to find a Shiite mosque in Sydney and assuming the appellant's claims were not credible.
 The RRT considered all of his claims and evidence but did not accept his fundamental claim of being a Shia Muslim, on which his claim for fear of persecution depended.
 I appreciate that it is difficult for an unrepresented appellant to understand the difference between judicial review for jurisdictional error and a review of the merits of the RRT's decision.
