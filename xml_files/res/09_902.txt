 The appellant's notice of appeal filed on 10 June 2009 identified one ground of appeal, namely, that the Federal Magistrates Court erred as it ought to have held on the evidence that it was open to the RRT to find that the appellant was a refugee.
 This ground is particularised as an allegation that the Federal Magistrates Court "failed to properly apply the consideration that applicants for refugee status ought to be given the benefit of the doubt in circumstances where the ...[RRT] entertained the possibility that the [appellant's] claims are plausible; which was the case here".
 This result, perhaps surprising at first glance, comes about because the ultimate question before the RRT is whether it is satisfied that the applicant has a well-founded fear of future persecution, in the sense of having a "real substantial basis" for the fear.
 If a fair reading of the reasons as a whole shows that the RRT itself had "no real doubt" (to use the language in Guo ) that claimed events had not occurred, there is no warrant for holding that it should have considered the possibility that its findings were wrong.
