 The Vanuatu Government has a Gender Equity Policy which is explicit in identifying violence against women and discriminatory laws as a hindrance to the advancement of women.
 The Bill, which provides for the protection of women and children from domestic violence, creates a specific domestic violence offence, allows police to intervene in instances of domestic violence and excludes bride price payments as grounds for defence in domestic violence cases.
 To the extent that these reforms were necessary, that was so since, like traditional Vanuatu culture, in nineteenth century Australian (or European) society, women were seen as the property of the husband.
 I would emphasise in this, for example, the evidence of the role of chiefs in settling family and domestic violence disputes and of the police's utilisation of the chiefs.
