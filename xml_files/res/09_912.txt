 The Vanuatu Government has a Gender Equity Policy which is explicit in identifying violence against women and discriminatory laws as a hindrance to the advancement of women.
 The Bill, which provides for the protection of women and children from domestic violence, creates a specific domestic violence offence, allows police to intervene in instances of domestic violence and excludes bride price payments as grounds for defence in domestic violence cases.
