 Developments between 30 June 2009 and 27 July 2009 On 16 July 2009 Ms Collins-Rubie resigned as a director of Perfection Too and Mr Groves appointed two persons who were independent of him and Ms Collins-Rubie to be directors in her place.
 But through its newly appointed independent directors, Perfection Too came to an accommodation with ASIC as a result of which ASIC no longer pressed for relief touching property held by Perfection Too as trustee of the Trust, and Perfection Too did not seek to be joined as a party.
 First, he submits that the evidence that ASIC had filed as of 30 June 2009 should have demonstrated to Ms Collins-Rubie that ASIC proposed to establish that she was herself a "relevant person" within s 1323 , and that indeed Ms Collins-Rubie had responded to that evidence in an affidavit.
