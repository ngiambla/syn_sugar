 Further correspondence ensued between the Tribunal and the appellant's migration agent and on 6 September 2007 the Tribunal conducted a further hearing with the consequence that, on 29 November 2007, the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant the spouse visas.
 The Tribunal however considered that these findings in the appellant's favour, although based on strong evidence, were outweighed by other non-mandatory considerations which essentially went to the credibility of the appellant and his spouse.
 As a consequence the Tribunal did not accept the submissions of the appellant and his wife as to their relationship, and found that the relationship was not only not genuine, but was contrived by them for migration purposes.
 There is no explanation given as to why or in what way these statements bore on the marriage many months later, in circumstances where the appellant and the sponsor had been living together for over 33 months in the relevant period.
