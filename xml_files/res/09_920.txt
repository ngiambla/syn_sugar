 THE COURT DECLARES THAT: The threat made by SBriggs Pty Ltd by a letter from its solicitors to Uniline Australia Ltd on 4 April 2007 of bringing infringement proceedings against Uniline Australia Ltd for infringement of claim 13 of Australian Patent No. 706458 is unjustifiable.
 The threat made by SBriggs Pty Ltd by a letter from its solicitors to Uniline Australia Ltd, by its patent attorneys, on 16 July 2007 of bringing infringement proceedings against Uniline Australia Ltd for infringement of claim 13 of Australian Patent No. 706458 is unjustifiable.
 SBriggs further contends that the particular formulation of the offer involved an aggregated collection of proposals which made it difficult for SBriggs to "unravel all aspects of the offer before it [could] determine whether [the] offer [was] genuine".
