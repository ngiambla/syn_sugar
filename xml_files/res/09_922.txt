 On 1 April 2008, the federal magistrate again held a directions hearing and made the following orders: The [ appellant ] comply with the Court's order of 5 March 2008 by 4.00pm on 8 April 2008.
 On 6 May 2008, Heng V and Mr Lee filed in this Court a notice of appeal, purporting to be an appeal from the orders made on 1 April, 14 April and 15 April 2008.
 At the initial directions hearing, I raised the question whether leave to appeal from the orders of 1 April 2008 and 14 April 2008 was necessary, as those were clearly interlocutory judgments.
