 At the heart of Mr Zoia's appeal as best one can discern it is the argument that his Newstart allowance should not have been cancelled as there was no power to compel him to sign the new Newstart Activity Agreement.
 In those circumstances, Mr Zoia was unable to identify and I was unable to discern any prejudice which would have been occasioned to him by proceeding with the hearing of the appeal.
 On a number of occasions in the course of argument on the appeal, Mr Zoia indicated that he would like leave to appeal to the High Court to ventilate both the need for legal counsel and certain constitutional arguments.
 The "sufficiency of [s 634's] connection" with the head of power - cf Leask v Commonwealth [1996] HCA 29 ; (1996) 140 ALR 1 at 33 - is incontrovertible.
