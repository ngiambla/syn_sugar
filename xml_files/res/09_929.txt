 First, the reference in the definition in s.3(1) to "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment" indicates that a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorizes rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision.
 It was not the ultimate or operative determination of an issue as distinct from the determination of issues arising in the course of making such an ultimate decision ( Social Services, Director-General of v Chaney [1980] FCA 87 ; (1980) 31 ALR 571).
 The best guidance for this is the clear language of Mason CJ in Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; 170 CLR 321 that the decision will generally but not always entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense and a conclusion reached that is a step along the way in the course of reasoning leading to an ultimate decision would not ordinarily amount to a reviewable decision unless the statute provided for the making of a finding or ruling on that point so that the decision, though an indeterminate decision, might accurately be described as a decision under an enactment.
