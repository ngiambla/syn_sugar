 And when represented by (for example) counsel appearing on a pro bono basis, the Court is considerably benefited: SZKJV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 831 at [13] to [14].
 The further oral evidence established --- at best --- that the Applicant believed that his case before this Court was " closed " after the exchange with the officer of the Registry in January 2008.
 These observations have been applied by Finkelstein J in Applicants M160/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 195 at [5] , [2005] FCA 195 ; 85 ALD 532 at 535.
 A mistaken belief on the part of the Applicant that the events in January 2008 foreclosed further access to this Court cannot --- in the present circumstances ---be considered " special reasons ".
