 Assuming that the basis on which review is sought in this matter is a refusal to grant an informal review, the respondent complains that there is no evidence of a request for an informal review and there had been no agreement to conduct an informal review.
 In Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (at 335), Mason CJ discussed the meaning of 'decision' under s 3 of the ADJR Act and held (relevantly) (citations omitted): (1) Meaning of "Decision" The definition in s.3(1) does not elucidate significantly the meaning of the word "decision" as it is used in the A.D.(J.R.) Act.
 First, the reference in the definition in s.3(1) to "a decision of an administrative character made ... under an enactment" indicates that a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorizes rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision.
 And as held in Ruddy v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 337 , the decision to sue for recovery was not a decision on an important substantive issue which was the essence of an ultimate decision which would have far-reaching consequences.
