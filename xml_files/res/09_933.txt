 The respondent objects to the competency of the application on the basis that the decision to issue a demand for payment was not a decision to which the ADJR Act applies as it was not a decision made under an enactment.
 The respondent points to the fact that the issue for demand of a payment is an exercise by the respondent only of non-statutory powers as indicated in Guss v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCAFC 88 ; (2006) 152 FCR 88 and Cooper J in Century Yuasa Batteries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 73 FCR 528.
 APPROACH TO COMPETENCY CHALLENGE The Court has jurisdiction to determine that it has no jurisdiction in respect of a proceeding instituted in the Court and to dismiss the proceeding accordingly ( Residual Assco Group Ltd v Spalvins [2000] HCA 33 ; (2000) 202 CLR 629 at [14] ).
 It is apparent from the definition of 'decision to which this Act applies' in s 3 of the ADJR Act that the Act only applies where there is a making of, proposal to make or requirement to make a decision, the decision is of an administrative character, and the decision is made under an enactment.
 It is clear that a "decision to which this Act applies" must be a decision of an administrative character, that it may be made in the exercise of a discretion, and that it must be made under an enactment.
 A general authorisation for a body to act in a certain way is not usually regarded as being sufficient to qualify a decision as being one made under an enactment: Salerno v National Crime Authority (1997) 75 FCR 133.
 Indeed the High Court went on to observe that even though a decision taken may have a critical effect for the operation of the federal statute, if it is a decision made 'dehors' the federal statute, it would be un-reviewable.
 CONSIDERATION In the present circumstances, the decision about which complaint is made does not constitute a decision in the sense contemplated in s 3 of the ADJR Act or as explained by the Chief Justice in Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; 170 CLR 321.
 It was not the ultimate or operative determination of an issue as distinct from the determination of issues arising in the course of making such an ultimate decision ( Social Services, Director-General of v Chaney [1980] FCA 87 ; (1980) 31 ALR 571).
 In Century Yuasa Batteries Pty 73 FCR 528 it was held that the Commissioner's decision to seek to recover an amount equal to withholding tax and penalty for late payment due by the applicant and the demand for payment of those sums was not reviewable because it did not constitute a substantive determination.
 And as held in Ruddy v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 82 FCR 337 , the decision to sue for recovery was not a decision on an important substantive issue which was the essence of an ultimate decision which would have far-reaching consequences.
 Equally, Cooper J held in Golden City Car Truck Centre Pty Ltd v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1999) 56 ALD 177 , a decision to commence proceedings for recovery of tax due under the ITAA 1936 is not a reviewable decision.
