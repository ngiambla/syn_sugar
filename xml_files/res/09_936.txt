 Before the Federal Magistrate it was contended that the June 2008 letter provided corroborative evidence and had been rejected upon a " positive basis " which had not been put to the Applicant.
 Whilst the Tribunal stated that it did not give the June 2008 Letter any weight and stated that the June 2008 Letter was " dubious in other ways ", the Tribunal referred in particular to the blacked out banner and the spelling mistakes.
 Rather, the weight given by the Tribunal to the content of the June 2008 Letter provided no support to the " genuineness " of the Applicant's claims that his father was a vice president of the local Awami League. [43] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the consideration by the Tribunal of the June 2008 Letter did not reflect a positive finding that the document was not genuine.
 Of present relevance is the fact that the Applicant had been " sufficiently alerted " by the Tribunal as to its concerns in respect to documents such as the June 2008 letter.
