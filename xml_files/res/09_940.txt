 On 9 December 2008, the applicant was ordered to file and serve on the respondents then represented in Court submissions in relation to the disposition of the application in relation to s 190F(6) on or before 28 February 2009.
 Notwithstanding all these difficulties, the solicitors for the applicant say that considerable resources have been put into the preparation of the Central West claim with extensive research undertaken into the laws, customs and historical and cultural connections of the Central West people.
