 On 9 December 2008, the applicant was ordered to file and serve on the respondents then represented in Court submissions in relation to the disposition of the application in relation to s 190F(6) on or before 28 February 2009.
 The amendments inserted by item 73 are intended to provide a greater focus on the responsibility of applicants to take steps to improve the quality of their claims, recognising that poor quality claims are a burden on the native title system.
 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Act Amendment Bill 2006 suggests that the criterion set out in s 190F(6): ... will ensure that applications are not dismissed where there is good reason for a claim remaining in the system, despite being unregistered.
 Notwithstanding all these difficulties, the solicitors for the applicant say that considerable resources have been put into the preparation of the Central West claim with extensive research undertaken into the laws, customs and historical and cultural connections of the Central West people.
