 If the Court considers the application has been amended since consideration by the Registrar or is likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the Registrar, it would be appropriate for the Court to await the outcome of the reapplication of the registration test before considering whether to dismiss the application.
 As to the principles applicable to how s 190F(6) should operate, I refer to and respectfully adopt, (without repeating), the recent analysis by Logan J in Christine George Ors on behalf of the Gurambilbarra People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 1518.
 THE HISTORY By letter dated 30 August 2007, the delegate of the Native Title Registrar pursuant to ss 190 , 190A , 190B , 190C and 190D NTA rejected the claim for registration purposes pursuant to s 190A NTA concluding that it was not possible to determine whether the claim satisfied all of the conditions in s 190B because of a failure to satisfy s 190C NTA.
