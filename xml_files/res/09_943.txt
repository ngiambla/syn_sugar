 In September 1998 the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Commission (which later became the ICRC) ("the IPARC") was asked by the ACT to: "advise on the approach to establishing an appropriate water abstraction charge that reflects sound economic and environmental principles as well as providing advice on the structure and level of charges that would apply if that approach were applied. " The report of the IPARC was provided in May 1999.
 Whilst the proper conclusion is that the amount paid for a commercial abalone licence is not a tax and, therefore, is not a duty of excise, that conclusion flows from all the circumstances of the case.
 Applying the observation in Air Caledonie , that conclusion might be available with respect to so much of the charge as had no discernible relationship with the value of what was acquired.
