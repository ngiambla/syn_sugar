 The respondents are (respectively) an innovator pharmaceutical company incorporated in the United State of America, Wyeth, and its wholly owned Australian subsidiary, Wyeth Australia Pty Limited ( Wyeth and Wyeth Australia ).
 Accordingly and for the purposes of this application, I accept that, as the evidence currently stands, Wyeth has a reasonably strong prima facie case for infringement under s 117 of the Patents Act .
 The statement on p 4C of the specification that attempts to produce a single daily dosing formulation using hydrogel tablet technology "proved fruitless" appears as a part of this example of one embodiment of the invention.
 It is to the effect that a representation that the invention did not include a method using hydrogel tablet technology induced the grant of a patent that did extend to the use of hydrogel tablet technology.
