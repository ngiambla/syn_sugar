 The appellant also observed that this required consideration of the whole of the Tribunal's reasons rather than any assumption that "ambiguity in the Tribunal's reasons be resolved in the Tribunal's favour" ( SZCBT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2007] FCA 9 at [26] ).
 In particular, the Tribunal's reasons disclose that the Tribunal understood that the non-discriminatory application of laws of general application to a conscientious objector could not engage the 1951 Convention if the conscientious objection is not "a significant and essential reason for motivating the persecutor to harm" the appellant.
