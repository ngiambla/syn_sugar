 The Tribunal noted that independent information indicated that Biharis living in camps are deprived of education, yet, the appellant's mother and father both provided Higher School Certificates and Secondary School Certificates from schools outside of the camps.
 The Tribunal also noted that independent information indicated that Biharis living in camps are deprived of employment, yet the appellant's father lodged a visa application which recited that he was a cook and his passport recorded that his occupation was "private service".
 The Tribunal advised that this information was relevant because the information "indicates that your claim that your mother is a Bihari who lived in a refugee camp is not true".
