 The application before the Federal Magistrates Court was dismissed on the ground that the appellant as applicant failed to appear at the hearing of the proceeding set down for determination on 19 June 2008.
 The Tribunal concluded that explanations about the time differential between serious threats having been made and action being taken by the applicant well after the threats, were incoherent and inconsistent with a claimed fear of persecution and harm.
 The extensive analysis of the material shows that the Tribunal considered the claims of the applicant against the background of earlier evidence, documents and the oral evidence of the applicant given to the Tribunal as reconstituted.
