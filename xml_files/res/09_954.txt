 When the matter was called for hearing today, Senior Counsel for the applicant handed up proposed orders which, in paragraphs numbered 1 - 8 inclusive, sought the same relief as was set out in paragraphs 1 - 7 of the Amended Application filed 29 July 2009, but split the injunctive relief sought in paragraph 3 into two paragraphs which became paragraphs 3 and 4 in the draft orders.
 The applicant asks the Court to make declarations descending into, if I may say so, minute detail in respect of the claims made by the respondents through the websites and referable to the salt water which are said to be false, misleading and deceptive.
 I propose to dissolve the interim injunctions which have been ordered and to grant injunctions in the terms proposed in the draft order, which the applicant has handed up, and I am willing to make a declaration generally along the lines of the declaration which I have just proposed.
