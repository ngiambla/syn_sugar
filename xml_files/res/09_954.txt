 The applicant asks the Court to make declarations descending into, if I may say so, minute detail in respect of the claims made by the respondents through the websites and referable to the salt water which are said to be false, misleading and deceptive.
 I propose to dissolve the interim injunctions which have been ordered and to grant injunctions in the terms proposed in the draft order, which the applicant has handed up, and I am willing to make a declaration generally along the lines of the declaration which I have just proposed.
