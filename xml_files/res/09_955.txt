 Radar contacted, or attempted to contact, the GAU shareholders who did not accept the GAU offer to ascertain whether those shareholders would be in favour of receiving the consideration offered by Sylvania under the GAU offer for their GAU shares.
 In the current situation, Sylvania Resources Limited ( Sylvania ) did not take any steps to extend the offer period or make any announcements that it was proposing to extend the offer period until after the offer period had expired.
 I further consider that in circumstances where the Parliament has provided for a minority shareholder to have the right to object and for fair value to be considered by the Court, it is not a necessary part of the legislative scheme that the Court, when considering an application for approval under s 661A(3), should provide for notice of the application for approval to be given to shareholders generally or shareholders who have not accepted the offer made in the takeover to date.
