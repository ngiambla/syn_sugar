 The affidavit evidence filed by the Respondents devotes greatest attention to the difficulties, financial and otherwise, which it is apprehended the individual Respondents will confront were the trial of the proceeding to be held away from Perth and, particularly, in Melbourne.
 Concern was also expressed about the manner in which pre-trial matters such as discovery, inspection and the resolution of contested privilege claims might be resolved were the proceeding not transferred to the Western Australian District Registry.
 On the one hand, if the party who commenced the proceeding chose that place capriciously the Court would be justified in giving no weight to the choice of place.
