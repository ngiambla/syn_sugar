 The decisions were identical and in respect of two related matters (BRG 649/2008 and BRG 742/2008) involving the same applicant and respondent, and which matters were heard together.
 In refusing the application made by the Applicant to vacate prior orders and adjourn the trial, the learned Federal Magistrate erred as a matter of law by failing to take into account: that the Court had been appraised of the parties' non-compliance with the pre-trial directions orders on or by 4 August 2009; the severe and prejudicial consequences of the refusal for the Applicant and for the Respondent; the effect of the refusal on the likely length and cost of the trial.
 On 19 August 2009 the applicant filed two identical applications and supporting affidavits (one in respect of each matter before the Court) seeking vacation of the trial date, and certain orders leading up to trial.
 On 20 August 2009 Mr Green attempted to contact the associate to the Federal Magistrate, and left a voicemail message referring to the applications filed 19 August 2009, and stating that further correspondence signed by both parties indicating consent to the orders sought in the application was to be faxed to the Federal Magistrates chambers.
