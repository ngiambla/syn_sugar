 In February 2006 the respondent lodged an application for a further business visa in which she provided an address to which correspondence should be sent (the Bridgewater Way address).
 His Honour rejected the Minister's submission that the second notification letter was merely a courtesy letter, in effect advising of the decision, and that it did not invalidate the earlier notification.
 The Minister says that s 494C(4) would have operated to deem the first notification letter to have been received even if the respondent's notification of change of address had been received by the Department between 7 August 2007 (when the letter was sent) and 16 August 2007 (when it was deemed to have been received).
