 The AAT did have on the other hand, hundreds of pages of material from previous hearings, submissions and communications from Mr Fazio all in relation to the issue of whether or not, by reason of her relationship, Centrelink had overpaid Ms Underdown $70.86.
 In any event, I believe a reasonable and fair juxtaposition of the evidence that was before the AAT would not lead to the bald decision of the AAT as reflected in the written reasons for decision.
 I mistakenly relied on the DEFICIENT notice of the AAT addressed to Samantha dated the day after Samanthas passing at page 102, in that all documents before the SSAT were being supplied by Centrelink, not just lawfully inadmissible, irrelevant and prejudicial material.
