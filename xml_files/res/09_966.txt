 It does not require a leap of imagination to infer that, in view of the visa applicant's relative youth and the time which has passed since the relevant parties last met, it is natural that the visa applicant would wish to travel to Australia to visit his parents.
 If the Tribunal subsequently found that the visa applicant lacked credibility in relation to his stated reason for wishing to visit Australia --- again, an issue which is at the core of this case --- the Tribunal should have explained why.
 Counsel for the Minister also submitted that the findings of the Tribunal as to the genuineness of the visa applicant's visit to Australia involved matters of weight of evidence, which are matters for the Tribunal and not subject to review by this Court.
