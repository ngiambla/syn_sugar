 On 18 July 2006, the Deputy Commissioner requested further information in order to determine whether the funds or assets likely to be recovered would be likely to outweigh the costs of the indemnity sought by the liquidator.
 Mr Chesters was also advised that the liquidator would need to apply for a further indemnity in respect of any additional recovery work to be undertaken by the liquidator that might be the subject of any further invoices to the ATO.
 The liquidator advised the ATO that the proposal of the directors to settle all claims in consideration of the payment of $100,000.00 subject to the Deputy Commissioner becoming a party to the proposed deed and providing a release, remained open for acceptance.
 The Deputy Commissioner says that the liquidator was in a position to control the costs incurred and he understood from the very outset that the Deputy Commissioner had imposed a limit on the funds that might be available.
