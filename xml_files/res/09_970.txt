 I accept that the use of the word "encouraged" in cl 12 of the 2006 Agreement was an acknowledgement that employees might have represented their views or interests to management otherwise than through "their own Employee Committee representative" or the Committee as a whole.
 The clause, I consider, did not preclude employees, either individually or as a group, from approaching management directly or through a representative, including a union organiser or delegate, who was not an Employee Committee representative or other member of the Committee.
 The weight to be accorded to such alternative forms of representation would, however, have been a matter for MaxiTRANS management and may well have varied according to the circumstances and the nature of the matter in issue.
