 The submission referred to the Minister's decision to make the determination of 14 July 2008 and recommended that, on the basis of all available information, including the further information supplied by the applicant, the Foreign Minister should affirm his original decision.
 Accordingly, on 29 January 2009, an officer of the Foreign Minister's department wrote to the applicant's advisers saying that the Foreign Minister had decided not to revoke the determination of 14 July 2008.
 The Tribunal deferred making a decision until the Foreign Minister had considered the applicant's request to the Foreign Minister to revoke the determination that he had made on 14 July 2008 and had affirmed on 19 September 2008.
