 He said that the Council knew that he was building his house and other structures on the Bukki block and did not stop him, or tell him that he could not do so.
 He has not received any letters or notices from the Council or anybody else, concerning his occupation of the Bukki block, save for notice of the Applicant's claim.
 OTHER EVIDENCE Ms Yeatman said that when she first met Mr Ludwick at Yarrabah beach he told her that he had a block of land and a house at Bukki.
 They lived there for a couple of years and then moved to the Bukki block so that her younger son could move into the house.
 It is possible that the withdrawal and the sketch were required by the Council prior to its processing the application for the land at Bukki.
 I also find that Mr Ludwick's actions in occupying the Bukki block and erecting the huts were tolerated by the relevant authorities (the Department and the Council).
 Pursuant to the deed of grant the relevant land was vested in the Council in trust for the benefit of Aboriginal inhabitants and for no other purpose.
 That section was inserted by the Land Act (Aboriginal and Islander Land Grants) Amendment Act 1982 (Qld) (the "Aboriginal Land Grants Act").
 Counsel for Mr Ludwick submit that s 20 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1954 (Qld) (the "State Interpretation Act") preserves his rights pursuant to s 361A.
 It was necessary for the Council (as trustee) and the Minister for Lands to be satisfied that a particular person was the person entitled to a lease relating to the improvements in question.
