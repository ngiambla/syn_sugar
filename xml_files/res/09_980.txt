 In the ACCC's Written Submission, Counsel for the ACCC made reference to several paragraphs in an affidavit filed in support of the ACCC's initial interlocutory application and to several documents exhibited to that affidavit.
 On 29 August 2008, pursuant to the Franchising Code of Conduct contained in the Act, Allphones sent a Notice of Dispute to approximately 90 of its franchisees ( the Notice of Dispute ).
 In late September and early October 2008, the solicitors for Allphones provided to the solicitors for the ACCC various documents which were then being sent to Allphones' franchisees for the purposes of resolving the issues adumbrated in the Notice of Dispute.
 In mid-October 2008, in communications to franchisees, Birch Partners was making much of the large discrepancy between the total figure for rebates and bonuses disclosed in the ACCC's Written Submission and the total figure asserted by Allphones as being the correct figure for those rebates and bonuses.
