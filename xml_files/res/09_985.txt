 This is an application for an extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court delivered on 23 June 2009.
 His Honour dismissed the applicant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice issued against him by the respondent; Makucha v Fairbrook PMA Pty Ltd [2009] FMCA 577.
 The Federal Magistrate therefore held that the Bankruptcy Notice did not exceed the amount due by the inclusion of interest referable to the period of deregistration and that the application to set it aside should be dismissed.
