 Paragraph 3 of the respondent's Notice of Motion dated 15 December 2008 be struck out or dismissed on the grounds that the applicant's claims against the respondent are not frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the Court, however, the Federal Court must not aid wrongdoers like the respondent in this case.
 The document also contains substantively all of the information required by section 23(3) of the Act and therefore can be accepted as a notice to Medicare Australia's Chief Executive Officer pursuant to section 23 of the Act.
 Prior to 29 September 2008, the respondent provided Medicare Australia with a copy of the Heads of Agreement and Medicare Australia considered that it met the requirements of a notice pursuant to s 23 of the Act.
 I will proceed on the basis that there is at least an arguable case that, in connection with the Heads of Agreement, the respondent failed to comply with s 23 of the Health and Other Services Act.
