 The objective facts do not seem to be in contention: It is also apparent from undisputed evidence before the Court that there were a number of problems with the translation of Ms Yu-Lin's evidence --- a mixing of Hokkien and Mandarin, failures to actually interpret, and certain omissions and distortions.
 It is accepted that it is possible the funds were by way of loan with the rental payments in lieu of interest and the subsequent transfer of the property to Ms Yu-Lin in 2007 being consideration for repayment of the principal.
 Whilst I do not accept that the failure to call Mr Athanasiou would have been a matter which I would have taken into account in supporting the respondent's position, the evidence before me indicates a justifiable reason and sufficient explanation for the applicant not seeking to adduce evidence from Mr Athanasiou.
