 On the face of Pt 3 of Sch 1 of the WR Act, the Court is simply required to consider the application and the material disclosed by the accompanying affidavits in order to consider whether it is "satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the application".
 Therefore, as a matter of construction, I do not consider that an application made by a relevant person pursuant to s 200(1) of Sch 1 of the WR Act is of itself a "proceeding" for the purposes of O 27 and O 27A of the FCR.
