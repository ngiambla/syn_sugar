misleading and deceptive conduct
comparative advertising based on market research
claim that "7 out of 10 johnson's holiday skin users preferred new dove summer glow"
effect of elucidator referring to survey participants
the representation as a whole was an invitation to generalise
representation was that holiday skin users preferred summer glow for its tanning attributes
representation was misleading as that preference was not 7 out of 10
market research tested one of two variants
representation unqualified as to variant and misleading
onus of proof
context in which representations were made implied adequate foundation for making them
criticisms made of market research methodology
evidence as to the consequences of some criticisms inconclusive
advertisements represented that the preference applied to women without age limitation
age of participants in market research limited
conclusions drawn from group surveyed wrongly applied to group being compared
respondent engaged in conduct in contravention of s 52
