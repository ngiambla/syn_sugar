student visa
failure to comply with condition 8202(3)(b)
migration review tribunal applied the wrong test by asking whether condition was "substantially" complied with
correct test was whether academic results had been certified by education provider to be "at least satisfactory"
tribunal wrote to the appellant and invited him to comment on information
invitation to comment did not correspond with information in the departmental file which formed a part of the tribunal's reason for affirming the decision under review or explain why that information was relevant
failure by the tribunal to comply with s 359a of the migration act 1958 (cth)
futility
tribunal bound to affirm the decision under review in the absence of a certificate
grant of relief would lack utility
appeal dismissed
