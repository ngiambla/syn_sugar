procedural fairness
whether letter sent by refugee review tribunal to applicant pursuant to section 424a of the migration act must be sent before hearing
whether material relied upon by the tribunal was "information" within s 424a of the act
held that there is no temporal element to s 424a such that it must be sent prior to hearing
tribunal therefore complied with s 424a
held that the material relied upon was not "information"
appeal dismissed.
