appeal from decision upholding refusal of grant of subclass 497 visa
whether the absence of the phrase "despite anything else in this act" has the effect that condition 8534 does not fall within the scope of s 41(2)(a) of the migration act
whether s 46(1a) therefore does not preclude a person holding a visa subject to condition 8534 from applying for another visa
held that s 41(2)(a) authorises a condition such as condition 8534
condition 8534 conforms to the requirement of the description contained in s 41(2)(a)
held the tribunal was not in error in concluding that condition 9534 was valid and operative
appeal dismissed
