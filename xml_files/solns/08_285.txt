whether administrative appeals tribunal denied comcare procedural fairness in refusing leave to inspect summonsed documents
documents related to previous injury of compensation claimant
credit of claimant main issue in proceedings
documents therefore not available for cross examination
tribunal must give parties a reasonable opportunity to present case
"reasonable opportunity" includes right to test evidence
tribunal's refusal potentially denied comcare opportunity to cross-examine effectively
whether access to documents should be denied as going only to credit
purpose for seeking documents clearly identifiable
not fishing to seek documents going to credit
wrong to determine questions of inspection by whether documents ought to be admitted into evidence
no need for documents to establish any specific fact
test of relevance is whether documents relate to issue in proceedings
discretion of tribunal under administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth) is subject to overarching obligation of procedural fairness
procedural fairness denied
administrative law
