australian securities and investments commission act 2001 (cth) s 12dl
debit cards and credit cards
statutory prohibition on a person sending out a card to a current cardholder unless it was a "card of the same kind" and certain other conditions were met
westpac sent "westpac debit mastercard" cards to holders of "westpac handycards"
customer could only use handycard to withdraw money from atm or eftpos or to make purchases by entering personal identification number (pin)
debit mastercard card differed from handycard because it (1) allowed customers to make purchases without entering pin number (over internet, post or telephone) and (2) it was able to be used more widely
australian securities and investments commission alleged that the ability to make purchases without entering a pin increased the likelihood of fraud, thus conflicting with the consumer protection purpose of the section
instances of fraud trivial compared to overall use
other suggested differences did not change essential nature of cards as debit cards
provision imposing criminal and civil liability
purposive construction
consumer protection provisions
caution in imposing wider construction that expands meaning of criminal provision
relevance of headings in an act
heading should be taken into account, but must not impose an unnaturally constricted or expanded meaning
relevance of earlier, now repealed, legislation
where earlier legislation was differently worded, and current legislation is clear, past legislation should not guide meaning
banking and finance
statutes
