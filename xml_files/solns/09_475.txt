status of guidance and statement of best practice issued by insolvency practitioners association of australia (ipaa)
whether those documents, standing alone and unsupported by expert evidence, established a professional standard in relevant sense
(2) whether contravention of s 450e(2) established by g's writing on his chartered accountant's letterhead to creditors informing them of progress of administration under deed of company arrangement (doca)
