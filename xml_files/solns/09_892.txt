appeal from orders made by federal magistrate dismissing appellant's application for review of decision of minister's delegate refusing appellant protection visa
decision of minister's delegate affirmed by refugee review tribunal
where appellant claimed fear of persecution for convention reason because he was member of social groups consisting of a family of coptic christians with prominent members that proselytise muslims in egypt and coptic christian proselytisers of muslims in egypt
where appellant claimed his father, grandfather and uncle had been killed for proselytising muslims in egypt
whether tribunal committed jurisdictional error by deciding that death of appellant's grandfather and uncle did not affect appellant's position in egypt or by deciding that appellant's version of his father's death had been concocted or by failing to consider question of social group or by failing to conduct hearing in unbiased manner as evidenced by findings in relation to appellant's father's death and letter provided by appellant's priest
