applications made for business skills (residence) (class df) visas
applications refused on the grounds that the appellants had a history of involvement in business activities that are of a nature that is not generally acceptable in australia
whether cl 892.214 in schedule 2 of the migration regulations 1994 (cth) which proscribes such involvement is invalid because it is overly wide, vague and uncertain
held that cl 892.214 is capable of meaningful determination and a valid exercise of the delegated power in s 31(2) of the migration act 1958 (cth)
whether the migration review tribunal misconstrued a test of "not generally accepted in australia" with a test of "unlawful in australia"
held that the tribunal characterised the activities as, first, being "likely to be offensive to a large section of the australian population", and secondly, as being "unlawful"
tribunal did not misapply cl 892.214
appeal dismissed
